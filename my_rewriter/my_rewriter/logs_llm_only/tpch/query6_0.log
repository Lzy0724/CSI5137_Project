WINDOW_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS:\n"""Rule that reduces constants inside a LogicalWindow."""'}], 'response': 'To optimize the given SQL query, we need to analyze the query and the provided rewrite rules to determine which rules can be applied to improve performance. The query is a simple aggregation with a filter and a limit clause. Let\'s break down the query:\n\n1. **Aggregation**: The query calculates the sum of `l_extendedprice * l_discount` and names it as `revenue`.\n2. **Filter Conditions**: \n   - `l_shipdate` is between \'1994-01-01\' and \'1995-01-01\'.\n   - `l_discount` is between 0.05 and 0.07.\n   - `l_quantity` is less than 24.\n3. **Limit**: The query limits the result to 1 row.\n\nGiven the simplicity of the query, many of the provided rules are not applicable. However, we can consider the following:\n\n- **FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS**: This rule reduces constants inside a LogicalFilter. The filter conditions in the query involve constant expressions (e.g., `0.06 - 0.01` and `0.06 + 0.01`). Applying this rule can simplify these expressions.\n\n- **FILTER_AGGREGATE_TRANSPOSE**: This rule pushes a Filter past an Aggregate. However, in this query, the filter is already applied before the aggregation, which is the optimal order for performance. Therefore, this rule is not applicable.\n\n- **AGGREGATE_REDUCE_FUNCTIONS**: This rule reduces aggregate functions to simpler forms. The aggregation in the query is already simple, so this rule is not applicable.\n\n- **AGGREGATE_REMOVE**: This rule removes an Aggregate if it computes no aggregate functions or all the aggregate functions are splittable. The query computes an aggregate function (`SUM`), so this rule is not applicable.\n\n- **PROJECT_REMOVE**: This rule removes a Project node that merely returns its input. The query does not have a separate project operation, so this rule is not applicable.\n\nAfter analyzing the query and the rules, the only applicable rule is `FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS` to simplify the constant expressions in the filter conditions.\n\nLet\'s apply the `FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS` rule:\n\n1. **Original Filter Condition**:\n   - `l_discount between 0.06 - 0.01 and 0.06 + 0.01` can be simplified to `l_discount between 0.05 and 0.07`.\n\n2. **Transformed Query**:\n   ```sql\n   select\n       sum(l_extendedprice * l_discount) as revenue\n   from\n       lineitem\n   where\n       l_shipdate >= date \'1994-01-01\'\n       and l_shipdate < date \'1995-01-01\'\n       and l_discount between 0.05 and 0.07\n       and l_quantity < 24\n   limit 1;\n   ```\n\nThe transformed query is more efficient due to the simplified filter condition. Therefore, the selected rule is:\n\n```python\n["FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS"]\n```', 'time': 8.299234628677368}
