inefficiencies. The query involves a join between `lineitem` and `part` tables, a filter condition, and a subquery in the `WHERE` clause. The subquery calculates an average and is correlated with the outer query, which can be a performance bottleneck.\n\nLet\'s consider the available rewrite rules and determine which ones can be applied to improve the query\'s performance:\n\n1. **FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE**: This rule converts sub-queries from filter expressions into Correlate instances. The query contains a subquery in the `WHERE` clause, which can be optimized using this rule to potentially reduce the execution cost by transforming the subquery into a more efficient form.\n\n2. **FILTER_INTO_JOIN**: This rule tries to push filter expressions into a join condition and into the inputs of the join. The query has a join between `lineitem` and `part` with filter conditions on `p_brand` and `p_container`. Applying this rule can help push these filters into the join condition, potentially reducing the number of rows processed.\n\n3. **JOIN_CONDITION_PUSH**: This rule pushes predicates in a Join into the inputs to the join. This can further optimize the join operation by ensuring that only relevant rows are joined.\n\nLet\'s apply these rules step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Apply FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE\nTransform the subquery in the `WHERE` clause into a Correlate instance to optimize the correlated subquery.\n\n### Step 2: Apply FILTER_INTO_JOIN\nPush the filter conditions `p_brand = \'Brand#23\'` and `p_container = \'WRAP BAG\'` into the join condition to reduce the number of rows processed in the join.\n\n### Step 3: Apply JOIN_CONDITION_PUSH\nPush any remaining join predicates into the inputs of the join to further optimize the join operation.\n\nBy applying these rules, we aim to reduce the computational cost associated with the join and the correlated subquery, leading to a more efficient query execution.\n\n```python\n[\n    "FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE",\n    "FILTER_INTO_JOIN",\n    "JOIN_CONDITION_PUSH"\n]\n```', 'time': 5.827613830566406}
