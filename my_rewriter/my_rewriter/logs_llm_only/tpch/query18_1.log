The subquery in the `WHERE` clause can be optimized by transforming it into a join, which can potentially improve performance by allowing the database engine to use more efficient join algorithms and indexes.\n\nLet\'s analyze the query and apply the appropriate rewrite rules:\n\n1. **FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE**: This rule can be used to convert the subquery in the `WHERE` clause into a correlate, which can then be optimized further. However, in this case, we can directly transform the subquery into a join, which is more straightforward.\n\n2. **FILTER_INTO_JOIN**: This rule can be applied to push the filter condition into a join. We can transform the subquery into a join condition, which will allow the database engine to optimize the join more effectively.\n\n3. **JOIN_CONDITION_PUSH**: After transforming the subquery into a join, this rule can be used to push the join condition into the inputs of the join, which can help in further optimizing the join operation.\n\nLet\'s apply these rules step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Transform the Subquery into a Join\n\nThe original subquery:\n```sql\no_orderkey in (\n    select\n        l_orderkey\n    from\n        lineitem\n    group by\n        l_orderkey having\n            sum(l_quantity) > 315\n)\n```\n\nCan be transformed into a join:\n```sql\ninner join (\n    select\n        l_orderkey\n    from\n        lineitem\n    group by\n        l_orderkey\n    having\n        sum(l_quantity) > 315\n) as filtered_lineitem on o_orderkey = filtered_lineitem.l_orderkey\n```\n\n### Step 2: Apply the Join Condition\n\nNow, the query becomes:\n```sql\nselect\n    c_name,\n    c_custkey,\n    o_orderkey,\n    o_orderdate,\n    o_totalprice,\n    sum(l_quantity)\nfrom\n    customer\n    inner join orders on c_custkey = o_custkey\n    inner join lineitem on o_orderkey = l_orderkey\n    inner join (\n        select\n            l_orderkey\n        from\n            lineitem\n        group by\n            l_orderkey\n        having\n            sum(l_quantity) > 315\n    ) as filtered_lineitem on o_orderkey = filtered_lineitem.l_orderkey\ngroup by\n    c_name,\n    c_custkey,\n    o_orderkey,\n    o_orderdate,\n    o_totalprice\norder by\n    o_totalprice desc,\n    o_orderdate\nlimit 100;\n```\n\n### Step 3: Push Join Conditions\n\nUsing the **JOIN_CONDITION_PUSH** rule, we ensure that the join conditions are pushed into the inputs of the join, allowing the database engine to optimize the join execution.\n\nAfter applying these transformations, the query is optimized for better performance by leveraging join operations instead of subqueries.\n\nThe selected rules for this optimization process are:\n\n```python\n[\n    "FILTER_INTO_JOIN",\n    "JOIN_CONDITION_PUSH"\n]\n```', 'time': 7.141347885131836}
