Let\'s go through the potential optimizations step by step:\n\n1. **Filter Pushdown**: The query has a filter condition on `l_shipdate` and `n_name`. We can push these filters down to reduce the number of rows processed in the joins. The rule `FILTER_INTO_JOIN` can be applied to push filter expressions into join conditions.\n\n2. **Join Condition Push**: The query involves multiple joins. We can push predicates in a join into the inputs to the join using the `JOIN_CONDITION_PUSH` rule. This can help in reducing the number of rows early in the execution plan.\n\n3. **Join Predicate Transitive Push**: We can infer predicates from a join and create filters if those predicates can be pushed to its inputs using the `JOIN_PUSH_TRANSITIVE_PREDICATES` rule.\n\n4. **Aggregate and Filter Transpose**: The query has an aggregate operation after the subquery. We can transpose the aggregate and filter operations to optimize the execution plan using the `FILTER_AGGREGATE_TRANSPOSE` rule.\n\n5. **Sort Removal**: The query has an `ORDER BY` clause followed by a `LIMIT 1`. If the input to the sort is already sorted, we can remove the sort operation using the `SORT_REMOVE` rule.\n\nLet\'s apply these rules step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Apply `FILTER_INTO_JOIN`\nPush the filter conditions on `l_shipdate` and `n_name` into the join conditions to reduce the number of rows processed in the joins.\n\n### Step 2: Apply `JOIN_CONDITION_PUSH`\nPush predicates in the join conditions into the inputs of the join to further reduce the number of rows early in the execution plan.\n\n### Step 3: Apply `JOIN_PUSH_TRANSITIVE_PREDICATES`\nInfer additional predicates from the join conditions and create filters that can be pushed to the inputs of the join.\n\n### Step 4: Apply `FILTER_AGGREGATE_TRANSPOSE`\nTranspose the filter and aggregate operations to optimize the execution plan.\n\n### Step 5: Apply `SORT_REMOVE`\nRemove the sort operation if the input to the sort is already sorted.\n\nBy applying these rules, we can optimize the query execution plan to improve performance.\n\n```python\n[\n    "FILTER_INTO_JOIN",\n    "JOIN_CONDITION_PUSH",\n    "JOIN_PUSH_TRANSITIVE_PREDICATES",\n    "FILTER_AGGREGATE_TRANSPOSE",\n    "SORT_REMOVE"\n]\n```', 'time': 7.306264400482178}
