inefficiencies. The query involves a join between the `lineitem` and `part` tables, a filter condition, and a subquery in the `WHERE` clause. The subquery calculates an average, which is then used in a comparison.\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **Join Condition**: The query joins `lineitem` and `part` on `p_partkey = l_partkey`. This is a straightforward join condition.\n2. **Filter Conditions**: The query filters on `p_brand = \'Brand#25\'` and `p_container = \'WRAP PACK\'`.\n3. **Subquery**: The subquery calculates `0.2 * avg(l_quantity)` for each `l_partkey` and compares it with `l_quantity`. This subquery is correlated with the outer query, which can be inefficient.\n\n### Potential Optimizations:\n- **Subquery Optimization**: The subquery can be optimized by transforming it into a join, which can be more efficient than a correlated subquery.\n- **Filter Pushdown**: Ensure that filters are applied as early as possible to reduce the amount of data processed.\n\n### Selected Rewrite Rules:\n1. **FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE**: This rule can help convert the subquery into a correlate, potentially allowing for more efficient execution.\n2. **FILTER_INTO_JOIN**: This rule can push filter conditions into the join, which can help reduce the data processed by the join.\n\nLet\'s apply these rules step by step:\n\n1. **Apply FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE**:\n   - Transform the subquery into a join. This involves rewriting the subquery as a join with an aggregated table.\n\n   ```sql\n   select\n       sum(l_extendedprice) / 7.0 as avg_yearly\n   from\n       lineitem\n   join\n       part on p_partkey = l_partkey\n   join\n       (select l_partkey, 0.2 * avg(l_quantity) as threshold\n        from lineitem\n        group by l_partkey) as subquery\n   on lineitem.l_partkey = subquery.l_partkey\n   where\n       p_brand = \'Brand#25\'\n       and p_container = \'WRAP PACK\'\n       and l_quantity < subquery.threshold\n   limit 1;\n   ```\n\n2. **Apply FILTER_INTO_JOIN**:\n   - Push the filter conditions into the join to ensure they are applied as early as possible.\n\n   ```sql\n   select\n       sum(l_extendedprice) / 7.0 as avg_yearly\n   from\n       lineitem\n   join\n       part on p_partkey = l_partkey\n       and p_brand = \'Brand#25\'\n       and p_container = \'WRAP PACK\'\n   join\n       (select l_partkey, 0.2 * avg(l_quantity) as threshold\n        from lineitem\n        group by l_partkey) as subquery\n   on lineitem.l_partkey = subquery.l_partkey\n   where\n       l_quantity < subquery.threshold\n   limit 1;\n   ```\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe optimized query now uses a join instead of a correlated subquery, and filter conditions are pushed into the join. This should improve performance by reducing the amount of data processed at each step.\n\n```python\n[\n    "FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE",\n    "FILTER_INTO_JOIN"\n]\n```', 'time': 6.928703308105469}
