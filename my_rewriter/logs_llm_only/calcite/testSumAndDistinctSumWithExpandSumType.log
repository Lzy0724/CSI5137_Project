The query is:\n\n```sql\nSELECT SUM(comm), SUM(DISTINCT comm) FROM emp;\n```\n\nThis query calculates two aggregates: the sum of all `comm` values and the sum of distinct `comm` values. The presence of `SUM(DISTINCT comm)` suggests that there might be room for optimization by expanding distinct aggregates.\n\nLet\'s evaluate the relevant rules:\n\n1. **AGGREGATE_EXPAND_DISTINCT_AGGREGATES**: This rule expands distinct aggregates, such as `SUM(DISTINCT x)`, into a form that can be more efficiently executed by the database engine. This rule is directly applicable to our query because it contains `SUM(DISTINCT comm)`.\n\n2. **AGGREGATE_EXPAND_DISTINCT_AGGREGATES_TO_JOIN**: This rule is similar to the previous one but generates a join. It might be more complex and could introduce unnecessary overhead if a simpler expansion suffices.\n\n3. **AGGREGATE_REDUCE_FUNCTIONS**: This rule reduces aggregate functions to simpler forms. However, it doesn\'t specifically address distinct aggregates, so it might not be as directly applicable as the first rule.\n\nGiven the query and the rules, the most relevant and potentially beneficial rule is **AGGREGATE_EXPAND_DISTINCT_AGGREGATES**. This rule can transform the `SUM(DISTINCT comm)` into a more efficient form, potentially improving performance.\n\nLet\'s apply the selected rule:\n\n### Step-by-step Transformation:\n\n1. **Original Query**:\n   ```sql\n   SELECT SUM(comm), SUM(DISTINCT comm) FROM emp;\n   ```\n\n2. **Apply AGGREGATE_EXPAND_DISTINCT_AGGREGATES**:\n   - This rule will transform the `SUM(DISTINCT comm)` into a subquery or a join that calculates the distinct values first, then sums them. The exact transformation depends on the database engine\'s implementation, but conceptually it might look like:\n   ```sql\n   SELECT SUM(comm), (SELECT SUM(comm) FROM (SELECT DISTINCT comm FROM emp) AS distinct_comm) FROM emp;\n   ```\n\nThis transformation separates the distinct calculation from the aggregation, potentially allowing the database to optimize the distinct operation independently.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe application of the **AGGREGATE_EXPAND_DISTINCT_AGGREGATES** rule is the most suitable optimization for the given query. Other rules do not directly apply or offer significant benefits for this specific query structure.\n\n```python\n["AGGREGATE_EXPAND_DISTINCT_AGGREGATES"]\n```', 'time': 7.755103588104248}
