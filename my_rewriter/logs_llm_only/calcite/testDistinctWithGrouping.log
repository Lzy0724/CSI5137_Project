`SUM(DISTINCT sal)`. The most relevant rule for optimizing distinct aggregates is `AGGREGATE_EXPAND_DISTINCT_AGGREGATES`, which can help in transforming the query to improve performance by expanding the distinct aggregate into a more efficient form.\n\nLet\'s apply this rule step by step:\n\n1. **Original Query:**\n   ```sql\n   SELECT sal, SUM(comm), MIN(comm), SUM(DISTINCT sal)\n   FROM emp\n   GROUP BY sal;\n   ```\n\n2. **Apply `AGGREGATE_EXPAND_DISTINCT_AGGREGATES`:**\n   This rule will transform the `SUM(DISTINCT sal)` into a more efficient form by using a subquery or a join to handle the distinct values separately. The transformation might look like this:\n\n   ```sql\n   SELECT e.sal, SUM(e.comm), MIN(e.comm), d.sum_sal\n   FROM emp e\n   JOIN (\n     SELECT sal, SUM(sal) AS sum_sal\n     FROM emp\n     GROUP BY sal\n   ) d ON e.sal = d.sal\n   GROUP BY e.sal, d.sum_sal;\n   ```\n\n   Here, the distinct sum is calculated in a subquery, which is then joined back to the main query. This can improve performance by reducing the complexity of handling distinct values within the main aggregation.\n\nAfter applying the `AGGREGATE_EXPAND_DISTINCT_AGGREGATES` rule, the query is optimized for better performance. No further rules are necessary as the main performance bottleneck related to the distinct aggregate has been addressed.\n\nThus, the selected rule for optimizing the query is:\n\n```python\n["AGGREGATE_EXPAND_DISTINCT_AGGREGATES"]\n```', 'time': 4.277490615844727}
