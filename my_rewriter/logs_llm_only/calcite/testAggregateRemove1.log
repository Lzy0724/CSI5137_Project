operations. The query contains distinct aggregates like `bit_and(distinct sal)` and `count(distinct sal)`, which can be optimized by expanding them into joins or other operations that can handle distinct values more efficiently.\n\n### Step-by-step Optimization:\n\n1. **AGGREGATE_EXPAND_DISTINCT_AGGREGATES_TO_JOIN**: \n   - This rule is suitable for expanding distinct aggregates into joins, which can be more efficient for processing distinct values. By applying this rule, we can transform the distinct aggregates into a form that can be processed more efficiently by the database engine.\n\n2. **AGGREGATE_REDUCE_FUNCTIONS**:\n   - After expanding the distinct aggregates, we can apply this rule to reduce the complexity of aggregate functions if possible. This rule simplifies aggregate functions to their simpler forms, which can improve performance.\n\n### Applying the Rules:\n\n1. **AGGREGATE_EXPAND_DISTINCT_AGGREGATES_TO_JOIN**:\n   - Transform `bit_and(distinct sal)` and `count(distinct sal)` into joins that handle distinct values. This involves creating a subquery or a join that first selects distinct `sal` values and then applies the aggregate functions.\n\n2. **AGGREGATE_REDUCE_FUNCTIONS**:\n   - Simplify any remaining complex aggregate functions if possible. For example, if there are any redundant calculations or if the distinct handling can be further optimized, this rule will address those.\n\nBy applying these rules, we can optimize the query to handle distinct aggregates more efficiently, potentially reducing the computational overhead and improving query performance.\n\n```python\n[\n    "AGGREGATE_EXPAND_DISTINCT_AGGREGATES_TO_JOIN",\n    "AGGREGATE_REDUCE_FUNCTIONS"\n]\n```', 'time': 5.869924306869507}
