The query involves a `LEFT OUTER JOIN`, multiple tables in the `FROM` clause, and a `CASE` statement within the `SUM` aggregate function. The goal is to apply the most suitable rewrite rules to improve performance.\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **CASE Statement in Aggregation**: The query uses a `CASE` statement within the `SUM` function to differentiate between sales before and after a specific date. This can be optimized using the `AGGREGATE_CASE_TO_FILTER` rule, which converts `CASE`-style filtered aggregates into true filtered aggregates, potentially improving performance by simplifying the aggregation logic.\n\n2. **Join Conditions**: The query uses a `LEFT OUTER JOIN` between `catalog_sales` and `catalog_returns`. We should check if this join can be optimized or removed if it doesn\'t affect the result. However, since the query computes aggregates involving `catalog_returns`, removing the join might not be feasible without altering the query\'s semantics.\n\n3. **Filter Conditions**: The query has several filter conditions in the `WHERE` clause. We should consider pushing these filters down to reduce the data processed by joins and aggregations. The `FILTER_INTO_JOIN` rule can help push filter expressions into join conditions, potentially reducing the size of intermediate results.\n\n4. **Order By and Limit**: The query uses `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT`. If the input is already sorted, the `SORT_REMOVE` rule can remove unnecessary sorting operations. However, given the query\'s complexity, this might not be applicable.\n\n### Selected Rewrite Rules:\nBased on the analysis, the most promising rules to apply are:\n- **AGGREGATE_CASE_TO_FILTER**: To optimize the `CASE` statement within the `SUM` function.\n- **FILTER_INTO_JOIN**: To push filter conditions into join operations, potentially reducing the size of intermediate results.\n\n### Transformation Steps:\n1. **Apply AGGREGATE_CASE_TO_FILTER**:\n   - Convert the `CASE` statement within the `SUM` function into a filtered aggregate. This simplifies the aggregation logic and can improve performance.\n\n2. **Apply FILTER_INTO_JOIN**:\n   - Push applicable filter conditions from the `WHERE` clause into the join conditions. This can reduce the amount of data processed by the join operation.\n\n### Optimized Query:\nAfter applying the selected rules, the optimized query would look like this:\n\n```sql\nSELECT \n   w_state,\n   i_item_id,\n   SUM(cs_sales_price - COALESCE(cr_refunded_cash, 0)) FILTER (WHERE CAST(d_date AS DATE) < CAST(\'2001-05-21\' AS DATE)) AS sales_before,\n   SUM(cs_sales_price - COALESCE(cr_refunded_cash, 0)) FILTER (WHERE CAST(d_date AS DATE) >= CAST(\'2001-05-21\' AS DATE)) AS sales_after\nFROM\n   catalog_sales\n   LEFT OUTER JOIN catalog_returns ON (cs_order_number = cr_order_number AND cs_item_sk = cr_item_sk),\n   warehouse,\n   item,\n   date_dim\nWHERE\n   i_item_sk = cs_item_sk\n   AND cs_warehouse_sk = w_warehouse_sk\n   AND cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk\n   AND d_date BETWEEN (CAST(\'2001-05-21\' AS DATE) - INTERVAL \'30\' DAY) AND (CAST(\'2001-05-21\' AS DATE) + INTERVAL \'30\' DAY)\n   AND i_category = \'Books\'\n   AND i_manager_id BETWEEN 61 AND 100\n   AND cs_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 81 AND 100\n   AND cr_reason_sk = 5\nGROUP BY\n   w_state, i_item_id\nORDER BY w_state, i_item_id\nLIMIT 100;\n```\n\n### Selected Rules:\n```python\n[\n    "AGGREGATE_CASE_TO_FILTER",\n    "FILTER_INTO_JOIN"\n]\n```', 'time': 11.785374879837036}
