inefficiencies. The query involves multiple joins, filters, and aggregations. The goal is to apply rewrite rules that can simplify the query, reduce the amount of data processed, and improve performance.\n\n### Analysis of the Query:\n1. **Joins**: The query involves multiple joins between tables: `web_sales`, `web_returns`, `web_page`, `customer_demographics` (twice), `customer_address`, `date_dim`, and `reason`.\n2. **Filters**: There are complex filter conditions involving multiple OR clauses, which can be optimized by pushing filters down to reduce the data early.\n3. **Aggregations**: The query performs aggregations (`avg`) and groups by `r_reason_desc`.\n4. **Order and Limit**: The query orders the results and limits the output to 100 rows.\n\n### Potential Optimization Strategies:\n- **Filter Pushdown**: Push filters as close to the data source as possible to reduce the data volume early.\n- **Join Condition Optimization**: Ensure join conditions are efficient and consider removing unnecessary joins.\n- **Aggregation Optimization**: Simplify or push down aggregations if possible.\n\n### Selected Rewrite Rules:\n1. **FILTER_INTO_JOIN**: Push filter expressions into join conditions to reduce the data processed by joins.\n2. **JOIN_CONDITION_PUSH**: Push predicates in a join into the inputs to the join to filter data earlier.\n3. **FILTER_AGGREGATE_TRANSPOSE**: Push filters past aggregations to reduce the data before aggregation.\n4. **AGGREGATE_FILTER_TRANSPOSE**: Transpose aggregates below filters to allow filters to reduce data before aggregation.\n\n### Step-by-Step Transformation:\n1. **Apply FILTER_INTO_JOIN**: Push filter conditions into the join conditions to reduce the data processed by the joins.\n2. **Apply JOIN_CONDITION_PUSH**: Push join predicates into the inputs to further filter data before joining.\n3. **Apply FILTER_AGGREGATE_TRANSPOSE**: Push filters past aggregations to reduce the data before performing aggregations.\n4. **Apply AGGREGATE_FILTER_TRANSPOSE**: Transpose aggregates below filters to allow filters to reduce data before aggregation.\n\nBy applying these rules, we aim to reduce the data volume early in the query execution, optimize join operations, and streamline aggregations.\n\n```python\n[\n    "FILTER_INTO_JOIN",\n    "JOIN_CONDITION_PUSH",\n    "FILTER_AGGREGATE_TRANSPOSE",\n    "AGGREGATE_FILTER_TRANSPOSE"\n]\n```', 'time': 5.071575880050659}
