inefficiencies. The query involves multiple joins, filters, and a group by operation. The goal is to apply rewrite rules that can reduce the complexity of the query, push down filters, and optimize joins.\n\n### Analysis of the Query:\n1. **Joins**: The query involves multiple joins across different tables. Optimizing these joins can significantly improve performance.\n2. **Filters**: There are several filter conditions in the `WHERE` clause. Pushing these filters down can help reduce the data processed in joins.\n3. **Group By and Order By**: The query groups by customer details and orders by the count of records. Ensuring efficient aggregation is crucial.\n\n### Applicable Rewrite Rules:\n1. **FILTER_INTO_JOIN**: This rule can push filter expressions into join conditions, which can help reduce the data processed during joins.\n2. **JOIN_CONDITION_PUSH**: This rule pushes predicates in a join into the inputs to the join, which can optimize the join operation.\n3. **FILTER_AGGREGATE_TRANSPOSE**: This rule can push filters past an aggregate, potentially reducing the data before aggregation.\n4. **AGGREGATE_JOIN_TRANSPOSE_EXTENDED**: This rule can push down aggregate functions, which might help in optimizing the aggregation process.\n\n### Optimization Steps:\n1. **Apply FILTER_INTO_JOIN**: Push filter conditions into the join conditions to reduce the data processed during joins.\n2. **Apply JOIN_CONDITION_PUSH**: Push predicates into the join inputs to optimize the join operation.\n3. **Apply FILTER_AGGREGATE_TRANSPOSE**: Push filters past the aggregate to reduce the data before aggregation.\n4. **Apply AGGREGATE_JOIN_TRANSPOSE_EXTENDED**: Push down aggregate functions to optimize the aggregation process.\n\nBy applying these rules, we aim to reduce the data processed at each stage of the query, leading to improved performance.\n\n```python\n[\n    "FILTER_INTO_JOIN",\n    "JOIN_CONDITION_PUSH",\n    "FILTER_AGGREGATE_TRANSPOSE",\n    "AGGREGATE_JOIN_TRANSPOSE_EXTENDED"\n]\n```', 'time': 4.764400243759155}
