inefficiencies. The query involves multiple tables joined together using a comma-separated list, which implies a cross join, and then filters are applied. This can be inefficient, especially if the tables are large. We should aim to convert these cross joins into explicit inner joins with appropriate join conditions.\n\nLet\'s go through the query and identify the steps to optimize it:\n\n1. **Convert Implicit Joins to Explicit Joins**: The query uses a comma-separated list of tables, which is equivalent to a cross join. We should convert this to explicit inner joins with the appropriate join conditions.\n\n2. **Push Filters into Joins**: Once the joins are explicit, we can push the filter conditions into the join conditions to reduce the number of rows processed early in the query execution.\n\n3. **Remove Redundant Joins**: After converting to explicit joins and pushing filters, we should check if any joins are redundant and can be removed.\n\n4. **Optimize the Order of Joins**: The order of joins can impact performance. We should ensure that the most selective joins (those that reduce the number of rows the most) are performed first.\n\nLet\'s apply these steps to the query:\n\n### Step 1: Convert Implicit Joins to Explicit Joins\n\nThe original query uses a comma-separated list of tables, which is equivalent to a cross join. We will convert this to explicit inner joins:\n\n```sql\nSELECT c_customer_id AS customer_id,\n       COALESCE(c_last_name, \'\') || \', \' || COALESCE(c_first_name, \'\') AS customername\nFROM customer\nJOIN customer_address ON c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk\nJOIN customer_demographics ON cd_demo_sk = c_current_cdemo_sk\nJOIN household_demographics ON hd_demo_sk = c_current_hdemo_sk\nJOIN income_band ON ib_income_band_sk = hd_income_band_sk\nJOIN store_returns ON sr_cdemo_sk = cd_demo_sk\nWHERE ca_city = \'Marion\'\n  AND ib_lower_bound >= 26340\n  AND ib_upper_bound <= 26340 + 50000\nORDER BY c_customer_id\nLIMIT 100;\n```\n\n### Step 2: Push Filters into Joins\n\nThe filter conditions are already part of the WHERE clause, which is appropriate. However, we should ensure that these conditions are evaluated as early as possible in the query execution. In this case, the conditions are already applied after the joins, which is optimal given the structure of the query.\n\n### Step 3: Remove Redundant Joins\n\nReview the join conditions to ensure that all joins are necessary. In this case, each join condition is used in the SELECT clause or the WHERE clause, so no joins appear to be redundant.\n\n### Step 4: Optimize the Order of Joins\n\nThe order of joins can be optimized by considering the selectivity of each join. However, without specific statistics about the tables, we assume that the current order is reasonable. The join on `customer_address` is likely to be selective due to the `ca_city = \'Marion\'` condition, so it is appropriate to perform this join early.\n\nAfter applying these steps, the query is optimized. The main optimization was converting implicit joins to explicit joins, which allows the database engine to better optimize the join operations.\n\nThe selected query rewrite rules are:\n\n```python\n[\n    "JOIN_CONDITION_PUSH"\n]\n```\n\nThis rule is selected because it helps in pushing filter conditions into join conditions, which is a key part of optimizing the query by reducing the number of rows processed early in the execution.', 'time': 7.767155885696411}
