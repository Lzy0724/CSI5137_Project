inefficiencies. The query involves multiple subqueries, joins, and set operations (intersect and union). Let\'s break down the query and see where we can apply the rewrite rules:\n\n1. **Intersect Operations**: The query uses `INTERSECT` to find common elements across three sales tables (`store_sales`, `catalog_sales`, `web_sales`). The `INTERSECT` operation can be expensive, especially if the datasets are large. We can consider using the `INTERSECT_TO_DISTINCT` rule to translate the `INTERSECT` into a combination of `UNION` and `AGGREGATE` operations, which might be more efficient.\n\n2. **Joins and Filters**: The query performs several joins between sales tables, `item`, and `date_dim`. There are also multiple filter conditions applied. We can use rules like `FILTER_INTO_JOIN` to push filter conditions into join operations, potentially reducing the data size early in the execution plan.\n\n3. **Aggregation and Grouping**: The query performs aggregation operations with `GROUP BY` and `HAVING` clauses. We can look for opportunities to merge or simplify these operations using rules like `AGGREGATE_MERGE` or `AGGREGATE_REDUCE_FUNCTIONS`.\n\n4. **Subqueries**: The query uses subqueries to calculate `average_sales` and to filter items in `cross_items`. We can explore rules like `FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE` to optimize subquery execution.\n\n5. **Order and Limit**: The query ends with an `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT` clause. If the input is already sorted, we can remove unnecessary sorting using `SORT_REMOVE`.\n\nBased on this analysis, let\'s apply the following rules:\n\n1. **INTERSECT_TO_DISTINCT**: Convert `INTERSECT` operations to a combination of `UNION` and `AGGREGATE`.\n2. **FILTER_INTO_JOIN**: Push filter conditions into join operations.\n3. **AGGREGATE_MERGE**: Merge aggregation operations where possible.\n4. **SORT_REMOVE**: Remove unnecessary sorting if the input is already sorted.\n\nLet\'s apply these rules step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Apply INTERSECT_TO_DISTINCT\nConvert the `INTERSECT` operations in the `cross_items` CTE to a combination of `UNION` and `AGGREGATE`.\n\n### Step 2: Apply FILTER_INTO_JOIN\nPush filter conditions into join operations in the `cross_items` and `avg_sales` CTEs.\n\n### Step 3: Apply AGGREGATE_MERGE\nMerge aggregation operations in the `this_year` and `last_year` subqueries if possible.\n\n### Step 4: Apply SORT_REMOVE\nCheck if the final `ORDER BY` can be removed if the input is already sorted.\n\nAfter applying these rules, the query should be more efficient. Here is the list of selected rules:\n\n```python\n[\n    "INTERSECT_TO_DISTINCT",\n    "FILTER_INTO_JOIN",\n    "AGGREGATE_MERGE",\n    "SORT_REMOVE"\n]\n```', 'time': 7.7819297313690186}
