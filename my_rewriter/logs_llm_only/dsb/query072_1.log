inefficiencies. The query involves multiple joins, aggregations, and filtering conditions. Let\'s consider the provided rewrite rules and determine which ones can be applied to improve the query\'s performance.\n\n### Analysis of the Query:\n1. **Joins**: The query involves several joins, including inner joins and left outer joins. Optimizing join conditions and pushing filters into joins can improve performance.\n2. **Aggregations**: The query uses aggregate functions like `SUM` and `COUNT`. Optimizing these aggregations can reduce computation time.\n3. **Filters**: There are multiple filtering conditions in the `WHERE` clause. Pushing filters closer to the data source can reduce the amount of data processed.\n4. **Order and Limit**: The query orders the results and limits the output to 100 rows. Ensuring efficient sorting and limiting can improve performance.\n\n### Applicable Rewrite Rules:\n1. **AGGREGATE_CASE_TO_FILTER**: Converts CASE-style filtered aggregates into true filtered aggregates, which can be more efficient.\n2. **FILTER_INTO_JOIN**: Pushes filter expressions into join conditions, potentially reducing the data size early in the query execution.\n3. **JOIN_CONDITION_PUSH**: Pushes predicates in a Join into the inputs to the join, which can help in reducing the data processed by the join.\n4. **FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS**: Reduces constants inside a LogicalFilter, simplifying the filter conditions.\n\n### Optimization Steps:\n1. **Apply AGGREGATE_CASE_TO_FILTER**: Convert the `CASE` statements in the `SELECT` clause to use filtered aggregates.\n2. **Apply FILTER_INTO_JOIN**: Push applicable filter conditions into the join conditions to reduce the data size early.\n3. **Apply JOIN_CONDITION_PUSH**: Further push join predicates into the inputs to optimize join processing.\n4. **Apply FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS**: Simplify filter expressions to reduce computational overhead.\n\nLet\'s apply these rules step by step:\n\n1. **AGGREGATE_CASE_TO_FILTER**:\n   - Convert `SUM(CASE WHEN p_promo_sk IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)` to `COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE p_promo_sk IS NULL)`.\n   - Convert `SUM(CASE WHEN p_promo_sk IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)` to `COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE p_promo_sk IS NOT NULL)`.\n\n2. **FILTER_INTO_JOIN**:\n   - Push filters like `d1.d_week_seq = d2.d_week_seq` and `inv_quantity_on_hand < cs_quantity` into the respective join conditions.\n\n3. **JOIN_CONDITION_PUSH**:\n   - Push join predicates further into the inputs to optimize join processing.\n\n4. **FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS**:\n   - Simplify any constant expressions in the filter conditions.\n\nAfter applying these rules, the optimized query would look like this:\n\n```sql\nSELECT i_item_desc,\n       w_warehouse_name,\n       d1.d_week_seq,\n       COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE p_promo_sk IS NULL) AS no_promo,\n       COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE p_promo_sk IS NOT NULL) AS promo,\n       COUNT(*) AS total_cnt\nFROM catalog_sales\nJOIN inventory ON (cs_item_sk = inv_item_sk AND inv_quantity_on_hand < cs_quantity)\nJOIN warehouse ON (w_warehouse_sk = inv_warehouse_sk)\nJOIN item ON (i_item_sk = cs_item_sk)\nJOIN customer_demographics ON (cs_bill_cdemo_sk = cd_demo_sk)\nJOIN household_demographics ON (cs_bill_hdemo_sk = hd_demo_sk)\nJOIN date_dim d1 ON (cs_sold_date_sk = d1.d_date_sk)\nJOIN date_dim d2 ON (inv_date_sk = d2.d_date_sk AND d1.d_week_seq = d2.d_week_seq)\nJOIN date_dim d3 ON (cs_ship_date_sk = d3.d_date_sk)\nLEFT OUTER JOIN promotion ON (cs_promo_sk = p_promo_sk)\nLEFT OUTER JOIN catalog_returns ON (cr_item_sk = cs_item_sk AND cr_order_number = cs_order_number)\nWHERE d3.d_date > d1.d_date + INTERVAL \'3\' DAY\n  AND hd_buy_potential = \'>10000\'\n  AND d1.d_year = 1998\n  AND cd_marital_status = \'D\'\n  AND cd_dep_count BETWEEN 9 AND 11\n  AND i_category IN (\'Books\', \'Children\', \'Home\')\n  AND cs_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 43 AND 63\nGROUP BY i_item_desc, w_warehouse_name, d1.d_week_seq\nORDER BY total_cnt DESC, i_item_desc, w_warehouse_name, d_week_seq\nLIMIT 100;\n```\n\n### Selected Rewrite Rules:\n```python\n[\n    "AGGREGATE_CASE_TO_FILTER",\n    "FILTER_INTO_JOIN",\n    "JOIN_CONDITION_PUSH",\n    "FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS"\n]\n```', 'time': 7.863128185272217}
