inefficiencies. The query consists of a common table expression (CTE) `customer_total_return` and a main query that uses this CTE. The CTE performs a join and aggregation, while the main query applies additional filters and a subquery for filtering based on an average calculation.\n\n### Analysis and Optimization Steps:\n\n1. **Filter Pushdown**: The main query has several filters that can be pushed down to reduce the number of rows processed in the joins and aggregation. This can be achieved using the `FILTER_INTO_JOIN` rule.\n\n2. **Subquery Optimization**: The subquery in the main query calculates an average and multiplies it by 1.2. This subquery can be optimized by ensuring it is executed efficiently, potentially using the `FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE` rule to convert it into a correlate, which can be more efficient in some cases.\n\n3. **Join Condition Optimization**: The query involves multiple joins. Ensuring that join conditions are as selective as possible can improve performance. The `JOIN_CONDITION_PUSH` rule can help push predicates into join conditions.\n\n4. **Aggregate Optimization**: The CTE performs aggregation. Ensuring that the aggregation is done efficiently is crucial. The `AGGREGATE_FILTER_TRANSPOSE` rule can help by pushing filters below the aggregation, reducing the number of rows to aggregate.\n\n5. **Project Optimization**: The query selects many columns, some of which might not be necessary for the final result. The `PROJECT_REMOVE` rule can help eliminate unnecessary projections.\n\n### Selected Rules and Transformation:\n\n1. **FILTER_INTO_JOIN**: Push filters into join conditions to reduce the number of rows early in the query execution.\n2. **FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE**: Convert the subquery into a correlate for potentially more efficient execution.\n3. **JOIN_CONDITION_PUSH**: Push predicates into join conditions to make joins more selective.\n4. **AGGREGATE_FILTER_TRANSPOSE**: Push filters below the aggregation in the CTE to reduce the number of rows aggregated.\n5. **PROJECT_REMOVE**: Remove unnecessary projections to simplify the query.\n\n### Transformed Query:\n\n1. **Apply FILTER_INTO_JOIN**: Push `ca_state in (\'MO\', \'OH\', \'OK\', \'SD\')` and `ctr1.ctr_reason_sk in (15, 50)` into the join conditions in the main query.\n\n2. **Apply FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE**: Convert the subquery `(select avg(ctr_total_return)*1.2 from customer_total_return ctr2 where ctr1.ctr_state = ctr2.ctr_state)` into a correlate.\n\n3. **Apply JOIN_CONDITION_PUSH**: Ensure that join conditions are as selective as possible by pushing predicates into them.\n\n4. **Apply AGGREGATE_FILTER_TRANSPOSE**: Push `i_manager_id BETWEEN 91 and 100` and `wr_return_amt / wr_return_quantity between 271 and 300` below the aggregation in the CTE.\n\n5. **Apply PROJECT_REMOVE**: Remove any projections that are not necessary for the final output.\n\n```python\n[\n    "FILTER_INTO_JOIN",\n    "FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE",\n    "JOIN_CONDITION_PUSH",\n    "AGGREGATE_FILTER_TRANSPOSE",\n    "PROJECT_REMOVE"\n]\n```\n\nThese steps should lead to a more efficient execution plan by reducing the number of rows processed at each stage of the query.', 'time': 7.534735441207886}
