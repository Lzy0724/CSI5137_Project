inefficiencies. The query involves multiple joins and complex filter conditions with OR clauses. The goal is to simplify the query execution plan by applying appropriate rewrite rules.\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **Joins and Filters**: The query involves multiple tables joined together with complex filter conditions. The use of OR conditions in the WHERE clause can lead to inefficient execution plans as they may prevent the database from using indexes effectively.\n\n2. **Aggregate Functions**: The query calculates averages and sums, which are aggregate functions. These functions can be optimized by reducing the data set they operate on.\n\n3. **Filter Conditions**: The filter conditions involve multiple OR clauses, which can be optimized by pushing filters closer to the data source or simplifying the conditions.\n\n### Selected Rewrite Rules:\n1. **FILTER_INTO_JOIN**: This rule attempts to push filter expressions into the join condition and into the inputs of the join. This can help in reducing the data set early in the execution plan.\n\n2. **JOIN_CONDITION_PUSH**: This rule pushes predicates in a Join into the inputs to the join. It can help in reducing the amount of data processed by the join operation.\n\n3. **FILTER_MERGE**: This rule combines multiple filter conditions into a single filter. This can simplify the execution plan and improve performance.\n\n### Transformation Steps:\n1. **Apply FILTER_INTO_JOIN**: Push filter conditions into the join conditions to reduce the data set early.\n\n2. **Apply JOIN_CONDITION_PUSH**: Push join predicates into the inputs to further reduce the data processed by the join.\n\n3. **Apply FILTER_MERGE**: Merge filter conditions to simplify the execution plan.\n\nBy applying these rules, we aim to reduce the data set size before performing joins and aggregations, leading to a more efficient query execution.\n\n```python\n[\n    "FILTER_INTO_JOIN",\n    "JOIN_CONDITION_PUSH",\n    "FILTER_MERGE"\n]\n```', 'time': 4.65989875793457}
