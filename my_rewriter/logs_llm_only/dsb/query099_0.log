inefficiencies. The query involves multiple tables joined together and uses aggregate functions with `CASE` statements. The goal is to apply rewrite rules that can simplify or optimize these operations.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis and Rule Application:\n\n1. **Identify Aggregate Functions with CASE Statements:**\n   The query uses `CASE` statements within `SUM` functions to categorize data based on the difference between `cs_ship_date_sk` and `cs_sold_date_sk`. This pattern can be optimized using the `AGGREGATE_CASE_TO_FILTER` rule, which converts `CASE`-style filtered aggregates into true filtered aggregates. This can improve performance by reducing the complexity of the aggregate operations.\n\n2. **Apply `AGGREGATE_CASE_TO_FILTER`:**\n   By applying this rule, we transform the `CASE` statements into filtered aggregates. This means each `SUM` function will directly filter the rows it needs to aggregate, rather than evaluating a `CASE` expression for each row.\n\n3. **Review Join Conditions and Filters:**\n   The query has several join conditions and filters in the `WHERE` clause. We should ensure that these conditions are efficiently applied. The `FILTER_INTO_JOIN` rule can help by pushing filter expressions into the join condition, potentially reducing the number of rows processed by the join.\n\n4. **Apply `FILTER_INTO_JOIN`:**\n   This rule pushes applicable filter conditions into the join operations, which can reduce the intermediate result size and improve join performance.\n\n5. **Check for Redundant Sorting:**\n   The query includes an `ORDER BY` clause. If the data is already sorted by the necessary columns, the `SORT_REMOVE` rule can be applied to eliminate unnecessary sorting operations. However, in this case, the sorting is necessary for the final output, so this rule is not applicable.\n\n6. **Limit Clause:**\n   The `LIMIT 100` clause is already optimizing the query by restricting the number of rows returned. No additional rules are needed for this part.\n\nAfter applying the relevant rules, the optimized query should have improved performance due to more efficient aggregate and join operations.\n\n### Selected Rules:\n```python\n[\n    "AGGREGATE_CASE_TO_FILTER",\n    "FILTER_INTO_JOIN"\n]\n```\n\n### Optimized Query:\n```sql\nselect \n   substring(w_warehouse_name,1,20)\n  ,sm_type\n  ,cc_name\n  ,sum(1) filter (where cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk <= 30) as "30 days"\n  ,sum(1) filter (where cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk > 30 and cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk <= 60) as "31-60 days"\n  ,sum(1) filter (where cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk > 60 and cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk <= 90) as "61-90 days"\n  ,sum(1) filter (where cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk > 90 and cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk <= 120) as "91-120 days"\n  ,sum(1) filter (where cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk > 120) as ">120 days"\nfrom\n   catalog_sales\n  ,warehouse\n  ,ship_mode\n  ,call_center\n  ,date_dim\nwhere\nd_month_seq between 1201 and 1201 + 23\nand cs_ship_date_sk   = d_date_sk\nand cs_warehouse_sk   = w_warehouse_sk\nand cs_ship_mode_sk   = sm_ship_mode_sk\nand cs_call_center_sk = cc_call_center_sk\nand cs_list_price between 248 and 277\nand sm_type = \'LIBRARY\'\nand cc_class = \'small\'\nand w_gmt_offset = -5\ngroup by\n   substring(w_warehouse_name,1,20)\n  ,sm_type\n  ,cc_name\norder by substring(w_warehouse_name,1,20)\n        ,sm_type\n        ,cc_name\nlimit 100;\n```\n\nThis optimized query should execute more efficiently by leveraging filtered aggregates and improved join conditions.', 'time': 12.282930374145508}

inefficiencies. The query involves multiple tables joined together, a WHERE clause with several conditions, and a GROUP BY clause with aggregate functions. The goal is to apply the most suitable rewrite rules to improve performance.\n\n### Analysis of the Query:\n1. **Joins and Filters**: The query uses implicit joins (comma-separated tables) and filters in the WHERE clause. These can potentially be optimized by pushing filters closer to the data source.\n2. **Aggregate Functions**: The query uses `SUM` with `CASE` statements, which can be optimized by converting them into filtered aggregates.\n3. **Order By and Limit**: The query orders the results and limits the output to 100 rows, which is generally efficient if the underlying data is sorted.\n\n### Applicable Rewrite Rules:\n1. **AGGREGATE_CASE_TO_FILTER**: This rule can convert `CASE` statements in aggregate functions into true filtered aggregates, which can be more efficient.\n2. **FILTER_INTO_JOIN**: This rule can push filter expressions into the join condition, potentially reducing the amount of data processed in the join.\n3. **JOIN_CONDITION_PUSH**: This rule can push predicates in a join into the inputs to the join, which can help in reducing the data size early.\n\n### Steps to Optimize the Query:\n1. **Apply AGGREGATE_CASE_TO_FILTER**: Convert the `CASE` statements in the `SUM` functions into filtered aggregates.\n2. **Apply FILTER_INTO_JOIN**: Push the filter conditions into the join conditions to reduce the data size before joining.\n3. **Apply JOIN_CONDITION_PUSH**: Further push join predicates into the inputs to optimize the join operation.\n\nLet\'s apply these rules step by step:\n\n1. **AGGREGATE_CASE_TO_FILTER**:\n   - Convert `SUM(CASE WHEN ...
