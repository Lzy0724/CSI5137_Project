inefficiencies. The query involves a common table expression (CTE) `customer_total_return`, which aggregates data from multiple tables, and a main query that joins this CTE with other tables and applies filters and sorting.\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **CTE `customer_total_return`:** \n   - It aggregates data from `catalog_returns`, `date_dim`, and `customer_address` tables.\n   - The aggregation is grouped by `cr_returning_customer_sk` and `ca_state`.\n\n2. **Main Query:**\n   - Joins the CTE with `customer_address` and `customer` tables.\n   - Applies a filter on `ctr_total_return` using a subquery to calculate the average return amount for each state.\n   - Filters on `ca_state = \'MI\'`.\n   - Orders the result by multiple columns and limits the output to 100 rows.\n\n### Potential Optimizations:\n- **Filter Pushdown:** The filter `ca_state = \'MI\'` can be pushed down into the CTE to reduce the data size early in the query execution.\n- **Join Condition Optimization:** Ensure that join conditions are efficiently utilized to minimize the data processed in joins.\n- **Subquery Optimization:** The subquery calculating the average can be optimized or potentially merged with the main query to reduce redundant calculations.\n\n### Selected Rewrite Rules:\n1. **FILTER_INTO_JOIN:** Pushes filter expressions into join conditions, which can help in reducing the data size early.\n2. **FILTER_AGGREGATE_TRANSPOSE:** Pushes a filter past an aggregate, which can help in reducing the data size before aggregation.\n3. **JOIN_CONDITION_PUSH:** Pushes predicates in a join into the inputs to the join, optimizing the join operation.\n\n### Transformation Steps:\n1. **Apply FILTER_INTO_JOIN:**\n   - Push the filter `ca_state = \'MI\'` into the CTE `customer_total_return` to reduce the data size before aggregation.\n\n2. **Apply FILTER_AGGREGATE_TRANSPOSE:**\n   - Push the filter `ca_state = \'MI\'` past the aggregation in the CTE to ensure only relevant data is aggregated.\n\n3. **Apply JOIN_CONDITION_PUSH:**\n   - Ensure that join conditions are efficiently utilized by pushing predicates into the join inputs.\n\n### Optimized Query:\n```sql\nwith customer_total_return as\n (select cr_returning_customer_sk as ctr_customer_sk\n        ,ca_state as ctr_state, \n \tsum(cr_return_amt_inc_tax) as ctr_total_return\n from catalog_returns\n     ,date_dim\n     ,customer_address\n where cr_returned_date_sk = d_date_sk \n   and d_year =2002\n   and cr_returning_addr_sk = ca_address_sk \n   and ca_state = \'MI\'\n group by cr_returning_customer_sk\n         ,ca_state )\n  select  c_customer_id,c_salutation,c_first_name,c_last_name,ca_street_number,ca_street_name\n                   ,ca_street_type,ca_suite_number,ca_city,ca_county,ca_state,ca_zip,ca_country,ca_gmt_offset\n                  ,ca_location_type,ctr_total_return\n from customer_total_return ctr1\n     ,customer_address\n     ,customer\n where ctr1.ctr_total_return > (select avg(ctr_total_return)*1.2\n \t\t\t  from customer_total_return ctr2 \n                  \t  where ctr1.ctr_state = ctr2.ctr_state)\n       and ca_address_sk = c_current_addr_sk\n       and ctr1.ctr_customer_sk = c_customer_sk\n order by c_customer_id,c_salutation,c_first_name,c_last_name,ca_street_number,ca_street_name\n                   ,ca_street_type,ca_suite_number,ca_city,ca_county,ca_state,ca_zip,ca_country,ca_gmt_offset\n                  ,ca_location_type,ctr_total_return\n limit 100;\n```\n\n### Selected Rules:\n```python\n[\n    "FILTER_INTO_JOIN",\n    "FILTER_AGGREGATE_TRANSPOSE",\n    "JOIN_CONDITION_PUSH"\n]\n```', 'time': 8.046462059020996}
