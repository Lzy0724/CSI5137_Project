rules. The query involves multiple joins, filtering conditions, and aggregation with a `ROLLUP` clause. The goal is to improve the query\'s performance by applying appropriate rewrite rules.\n\n### Analysis of the Query:\n1. **Joins**: The query involves multiple joins between `catalog_sales`, `customer_demographics`, `customer`, `customer_address`, `date_dim`, and `item`.\n2. **Filters**: There are several filtering conditions applied, such as `cd_gender = \'F\'`, `cd_education_status = \'Advanced Degree\'`, `d_year = 2002`, `c_birth_month = 11`, `ca_state in (\'CO\', \'GA\', \'TN\')`, `cs_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 43 AND 48`, and `i_category = \'Sports\'`.\n3. **Aggregation**: The query uses `AVG` functions and a `ROLLUP` clause for grouping.\n4. **Ordering and Limiting**: The results are ordered by `ca_country`, `ca_state`, `ca_county`, and `i_item_id`, with a limit of 100 rows.\n\n### Potential Optimization Steps:\n- **Filter Pushdown**: Push filters as close to the data source as possible to reduce the amount of data processed in joins and aggregations.\n- **Join Optimization**: Optimize join conditions and order to minimize intermediate result sizes.\n- **Aggregation Optimization**: Ensure that aggregation is performed efficiently, possibly by reducing the complexity of aggregate functions or merging aggregates.\n\n### Selected Rewrite Rules:\n1. **FILTER_INTO_JOIN**: This rule attempts to push filter expressions into join conditions and into the inputs of the join. This can help reduce the amount of data processed in the joins.\n2. **JOIN_CONDITION_PUSH**: This rule pushes predicates in a join into the inputs to the join, which can further optimize the join operation.\n3. **FILTER_AGGREGATE_TRANSPOSE**: This rule pushes a filter past an aggregate, which can help in reducing the data before aggregation.\n4. **AGGREGATE_REDUCE_FUNCTIONS**: This rule reduces aggregate functions to simpler forms, which can improve the performance of the aggregation step.\n\n### Applying the Selected Rules:\n1. **FILTER_INTO_JOIN**: Push filters like `cd_gender = \'F\'`, `cd_education_status = \'Advanced Degree\'`, `d_year = 2002`, `c_birth_month = 11`, `ca_state in (\'CO\', \'GA\', \'TN\')`, `cs_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 43 AND 48`, and `i_category = \'Sports\'` into the join conditions.\n2. **JOIN_CONDITION_PUSH**: Further push join predicates into the inputs of the join to optimize the join operation.\n3. **FILTER_AGGREGATE_TRANSPOSE**: Push filters past the aggregation to ensure that only necessary data is aggregated.\n4. **AGGREGATE_REDUCE_FUNCTIONS**: Simplify the aggregate functions if possible to improve performance.\n\nBy applying these rules, the query can be optimized to process less data and perform operations more efficiently.\n\n```python\n[\n    "FILTER_INTO_JOIN",\n    "JOIN_CONDITION_PUSH",\n    "FILTER_AGGREGATE_TRANSPOSE",\n    "AGGREGATE_REDUCE_FUNCTIONS"\n]\n```', 'time': 6.328672170639038}
