inefficiencies. The query involves multiple joins, a distinct count, and subqueries with `EXISTS` and `NOT EXISTS` clauses. Let\'s consider the available rewrite rules and determine which ones can be applied to improve the query\'s performance.\n\n### Analysis of the Query:\n\n1. **Joins and Filters**: The query uses implicit joins in the `FROM` clause and applies several filters in the `WHERE` clause. These filters can potentially be pushed down to reduce the data processed in joins.\n\n2. **Distinct Aggregation**: The query uses `COUNT(DISTINCT ws_order_number)`, which can be expensive. We can consider expanding distinct aggregates to joins if applicable.\n\n3. **Subqueries**: The query uses `EXISTS` and `NOT EXISTS` subqueries. These can sometimes be optimized by converting them into joins or using semi-joins.\n\n4. **Order By and Limit**: The query orders by the distinct count and limits the result to 100 rows. Sorting can be expensive, but since the limit is applied, it might not be a significant issue unless the dataset is very large.\n\n### Applicable Rewrite Rules:\n\n1. **FILTER_INTO_JOIN**: This rule can push filter expressions into join conditions, potentially reducing the amount of data processed in joins.\n\n2. **AGGREGATE_EXPAND_DISTINCT_AGGREGATES_TO_JOIN**: This rule can expand distinct aggregates into joins, which might improve performance by leveraging join optimizations.\n\n3. **JOIN_CONDITION_PUSH**: This rule can push predicates in a join into the inputs of the join, which can help in reducing the data size early in the execution plan.\n\n4. **FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS**: This rule can reduce constants inside a filter, which might simplify the query execution.\n\n### Optimization Steps:\n\n1. **Apply FILTER_INTO_JOIN**: Push the filter conditions into the join conditions to reduce the data processed in joins.\n\n2. **Apply AGGREGATE_EXPAND_DISTINCT_AGGREGATES_TO_JOIN**: Expand the `COUNT(DISTINCT ws_order_number)` into a join to potentially leverage join optimizations.\n\n3. **Apply JOIN_CONDITION_PUSH**: Push join predicates into the inputs to further reduce data size before the join operation.\n\n4. **Apply FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS**: Simplify the filter expressions by reducing constants.\n\nBy applying these rules, we aim to reduce the data size early in the query execution and leverage join optimizations for distinct aggregates.\n\n```python\n[\n    "FILTER_INTO_JOIN",\n    "AGGREGATE_EXPAND_DISTINCT_AGGREGATES_TO_JOIN",\n    "JOIN_CONDITION_PUSH",\n    "FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS"\n]\n```', 'time': 10.710420608520508}
