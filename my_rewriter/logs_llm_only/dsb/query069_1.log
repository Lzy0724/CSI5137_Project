inefficiencies. The query involves multiple joins, filters, and subqueries with `EXISTS` and `NOT EXISTS` clauses. The goal is to apply rewrite rules that can simplify the query, reduce the number of operations, or push down operations to improve performance.\n\n### Analysis of the Query:\n1. **Joins and Filters**: The query joins three tables (`customer`, `customer_address`, and `customer_demographics`) and applies several filters on these tables. The filters are applied on `ca_state`, `cd_marital_status`, and `cd_education_status`.\n\n2. **Subqueries with EXISTS and NOT EXISTS**: The query uses `EXISTS` and `NOT EXISTS` subqueries to filter customers based on their sales records in `store_sales`, `web_sales`, and `catalog_sales` tables. These subqueries are correlated with the main query through the `c_customer_sk` key.\n\n3. **Aggregation and Grouping**: The query performs aggregation using `COUNT(*)` and groups the results by several demographic attributes.\n\n4. **Ordering and Limiting**: The results are ordered by demographic attributes and limited to 100 rows.\n\n### Potential Optimizations:\n- **Push Filters Down**: Filters can be pushed down to reduce the number of rows processed in joins and subqueries.\n- **Simplify Subqueries**: The `EXISTS` and `NOT EXISTS` clauses can be optimized by ensuring they are executed efficiently.\n- **Remove Redundant Operations**: Check for any redundant operations that can be removed or simplified.\n\n### Selected Rewrite Rules:\n1. **FILTER_INTO_JOIN**: This rule can push filter expressions into join conditions, potentially reducing the number of rows processed in the join.\n2. **FILTER_AGGREGATE_TRANSPOSE**: This rule can push filters past aggregates, which might help in reducing the number of rows before aggregation.\n3. **JOIN_CONDITION_PUSH**: This rule pushes predicates in a join into the inputs of the join, which can help in reducing the data processed by the join.\n4. **FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS**: This rule reduces constants inside a filter, simplifying the filter conditions.\n\n### Applying the Rules:\n\n1. **FILTER_INTO_JOIN**: Push the filter conditions on `ca_state`, `cd_marital_status`, and `cd_education_status` into the join conditions. This reduces the number of rows processed in the join.\n\n2. **FILTER_AGGREGATE_TRANSPOSE**: Push the filters on `ca_state`, `cd_marital_status`, and `cd_education_status` past the aggregation. This ensures that only relevant rows are aggregated.\n\n3. **JOIN_CONDITION_PUSH**: Push the join conditions involving `c.c_current_addr_sk = ca.ca_address_sk` and `cd_demo_sk = c.c_current_cdemo_sk` into the inputs of the join. This reduces the number of rows processed by the join.\n\n4. **FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS**: Simplify the filter conditions by reducing any constants or simplifying expressions.\n\nBy applying these rules, the query can be optimized to reduce the number of rows processed at each stage, leading to improved performance.\n\n```python\n[\n    "FILTER_INTO_JOIN",\n    "FILTER_AGGREGATE_TRANSPOSE",\n    "JOIN_CONDITION_PUSH",\n    "FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS"\n]\n```', 'time': 7.538326978683472}
