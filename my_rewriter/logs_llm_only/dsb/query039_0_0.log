inefficiencies. The query involves a common table expression (CTE) named `inv`, which calculates statistical measures and filters based on a computed condition. The main query performs a self-join on this CTE and applies additional filters and sorting.\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **CTE `inv`:** \n   - The CTE calculates standard deviation (`stdev`) and mean (`mean`) for `inv_quantity_on_hand` and computes a coefficient of variation (`cov`). \n   - It filters rows where the coefficient of variation is greater than 1.\n   - The CTE involves a `GROUP BY` operation, which is necessary for the aggregation functions.\n\n2. **Main Query:**\n   - The main query performs a self-join on the CTE `inv` based on `i_item_sk`, `w_warehouse_sk`, and specific `d_moy` values.\n   - It orders the results based on several columns.\n\n### Potential Optimizations:\n- **Filter Pushdown:** The filter on `d_year`, `i_category`, `i_manager_id`, and `inv_quantity_on_hand` can be pushed down to reduce the number of rows processed in the join and aggregation.\n- **Join Condition Optimization:** Ensure that the join conditions are as selective as possible to minimize the number of rows processed.\n- **Remove Redundant Computations:** Check if any computations or conditions can be simplified or removed.\n\n### Applicable Rules:\n1. **FILTER_INTO_JOIN:** This rule can push filter expressions into the join condition, potentially reducing the number of rows processed in the join.\n2. **FILTER_AGGREGATE_TRANSPOSE:** This rule can push filters past aggregates, which might help in reducing the data size before aggregation.\n3. **JOIN_CONDITION_PUSH:** This rule can push predicates in a join into the inputs to the join, which can help in reducing the data size before the join operation.\n\n### Transformation Steps:\n1. **Apply `FILTER_INTO_JOIN`:** Push the filters on `d_year`, `i_category`, `i_manager_id`, and `inv_quantity_on_hand` into the join condition in the CTE. This reduces the number of rows processed in the join and aggregation.\n2. **Apply `FILTER_AGGREGATE_TRANSPOSE`:** Push the filter on `cov > 1` past the aggregation in the CTE. This ensures that only relevant rows are aggregated, reducing computation.\n3. **Apply `JOIN_CONDITION_PUSH`:** Ensure that the join conditions in the main query are as selective as possible by pushing predicates into the join inputs.\n\n### Optimized Query:\n```sql\nwith inv as\n(select w_warehouse_name, w_warehouse_sk, i_item_sk, d_moy, stdev, mean, \n        case mean when 0 then null else stdev/mean end cov\n from (select w_warehouse_name, w_warehouse_sk, i_item_sk, d_moy,\n              stddev_samp(inv_quantity_on_hand) stdev, avg(inv_quantity_on_hand) mean\n       from inventory\n       join item on inv_item_sk = i_item_sk\n       join warehouse on inv_warehouse_sk = w_warehouse_sk\n       join date_dim on inv_date_sk = d_date_sk\n       where d_year = 1999\n         and i_category IN (\'Books\', \'Shoes\')\n         and i_manager_id BETWEEN 81 and 100\n         and inv_quantity_on_hand between 800 and 1000\n       group by w_warehouse_name, w_warehouse_sk, i_item_sk, d_moy\n       having case avg(inv_quantity_on_hand) when 0 then 0 else stddev_samp(inv_quantity_on_hand)/avg(inv_quantity_on_hand) end > 1) foo)\nselect inv1.w_warehouse_sk, inv1.i_item_sk, inv1.d_moy, inv1.mean, inv1.cov,\n       inv2.w_warehouse_sk, inv2.i_item_sk, inv2.d_moy, inv2.mean, inv2.cov\nfrom inv inv1\njoin inv inv2 on inv1.i_item_sk = inv2.i_item_sk\n             and inv1.w_warehouse_sk = inv2.w_warehouse_sk\nwhere inv1.d_moy = 7\n  and inv2.d_moy = 8\norder by inv1.w_warehouse_sk, inv1.i_item_sk, inv1.d_moy, inv1.mean, inv1.cov,\n         inv2.d_moy, inv2.mean, inv2.cov;\n```\n\n### Selected Rules:\n```python\n[\n    "FILTER_INTO_JOIN",\n    "FILTER_AGGREGATE_TRANSPOSE",\n    "JOIN_CONDITION_PUSH"\n]\n```', 'time': 11.977672338485718}
