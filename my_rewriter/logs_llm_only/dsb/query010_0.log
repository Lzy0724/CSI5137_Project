inefficiencies. The query involves multiple joins, filters, and subqueries with `EXISTS` clauses. Let\'s go through the query and see which rewrite rules can be applied to improve its performance.\n\n### Analysis of the Query:\n\n1. **Joins and Filters**: The query involves joins between `customer`, `customer_address`, and `customer_demographics` tables, with filters applied on `ca_county`, `c_birth_month`, `cd_marital_status`, `cd_education_status`, and `cd_gender`.\n\n2. **Subqueries with EXISTS**: There are three subqueries using `EXISTS`, each involving joins with `store_sales`, `web_sales`, `catalog_sales`, `date_dim`, and `item` tables. These subqueries have similar filter conditions on `d_year`, `d_moy`, `i_category`, `i_manager_id`, and price ratios.\n\n3. **Grouping and Aggregation**: The query groups by several demographic attributes and counts occurrences.\n\n### Potential Optimizations:\n\n1. **Filter Pushdown**: We can push filters closer to the data source to reduce the number of rows processed in joins and subqueries.\n\n2. **Join Condition Optimization**: We can optimize join conditions by pushing predicates into the join.\n\n3. **Subquery Optimization**: The subqueries have similar conditions, which might be optimized by merging or simplifying them.\n\n### Selected Rewrite Rules:\n\n1. **FILTER_INTO_JOIN**: This rule can push filter expressions into join conditions, which can help reduce the number of rows processed in joins.\n\n2. **FILTER_MERGE**: This rule can combine multiple filters into a single filter, which can simplify the query plan.\n\n3. **JOIN_CONDITION_PUSH**: This rule can push predicates in a join into the inputs to the join, which can help optimize join processing.\n\n4. **FILTER_AGGREGATE_TRANSPOSE**: This rule can push a filter past an aggregate, which can help reduce the number of rows processed in aggregation.\n\n### Applying the Rules:\n\n1. **FILTER_INTO_JOIN**: Push filters on `ca_county`, `c_birth_month`, `cd_marital_status`, `cd_education_status`, and `cd_gender` into the join conditions between `customer`, `customer_address`, and `customer_demographics`.\n\n2. **FILTER_MERGE**: Combine filters on `d_year`, `d_moy`, `i_category`, `i_manager_id`, and price ratios in the subqueries to simplify the query plan.\n\n3. **JOIN_CONDITION_PUSH**: Push join predicates from subqueries into the inputs to the join to optimize join processing.\n\n4. **FILTER_AGGREGATE_TRANSPOSE**: Push filters past the aggregate to reduce the number of rows processed in aggregation.\n\nBy applying these rules, we can optimize the query to improve its performance.\n\n```python\n[\n    "FILTER_INTO_JOIN",\n    "FILTER_MERGE",\n    "JOIN_CONDITION_PUSH",\n    "FILTER_AGGREGATE_TRANSPOSE"\n]\n```', 'time': 7.585387945175171}
