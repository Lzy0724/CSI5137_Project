inefficiencies. The query involves multiple common table expressions (CTEs), joins, and aggregations. Let\'s break down the query and see where we can apply the rewrite rules:\n\n1. **CTE `my_customers`:** This CTE uses a `DISTINCT` clause to eliminate duplicate customer records. The `DISTINCT` operation is applied after a `UNION ALL` of two subqueries. Since `UNION ALL` does not remove duplicates, the `DISTINCT` is necessary here. However, we can consider if any rules can optimize this part.\n\n2. **CTE `my_revenue`:** This CTE aggregates sales data by customer and filters based on several conditions. It involves multiple joins and a `GROUP BY` operation. We should look for opportunities to push filters down or simplify joins.\n\n3. **CTE `segments`:** This CTE calculates a segment based on revenue and is straightforward. It doesn\'t seem to have optimization opportunities.\n\n4. **Final Query:** The final query aggregates the segments and orders the results. It uses a `LIMIT` clause to restrict the output.\n\n### Potential Optimization Opportunities:\n\n- **Filter Pushdown:** We can push filters closer to the data source to reduce the amount of data processed in joins and aggregations.\n- **Join Simplification:** If any joins can be simplified or removed, it would reduce the computational cost.\n- **Aggregate Optimization:** If there are opportunities to simplify or merge aggregates, it would improve performance.\n\n### Selected Rewrite Rules:\n\n1. **FILTER_INTO_JOIN:** This rule can push filter expressions into join conditions, potentially reducing the data volume early in the query execution.\n\n2. **JOIN_CONDITION_PUSH:** This rule can push predicates in a join into the inputs of the join, which can help in reducing the data processed by the join.\n\n3. **AGGREGATE_FILTER_TRANSPOSE:** This rule can transpose aggregates and filters, potentially allowing filters to be applied earlier.\n\n4. **AGGREGATE_REMOVE:** If any aggregates are redundant or can be simplified, this rule can help remove them.\n\n### Applying the Rules:\n\n1. **Apply `FILTER_INTO_JOIN`:** Push filters from `my_revenue` CTE into the join conditions. This will reduce the data processed by the joins.\n\n2. **Apply `JOIN_CONDITION_PUSH`:** Further push join conditions into the inputs of the joins in both `my_customers` and `my_revenue` CTEs.\n\n3. **Apply `AGGREGATE_FILTER_TRANSPOSE`:** Transpose filters and aggregates in `my_revenue` to apply filters earlier.\n\n4. **Apply `AGGREGATE_REMOVE`:** Check if any aggregates in the final query or CTEs can be removed or simplified.\n\nAfter applying these rules, the query should be more efficient by reducing the data processed at each step and simplifying the operations.\n\n```python\n[\n    "FILTER_INTO_JOIN",\n    "JOIN_CONDITION_PUSH",\n    "AGGREGATE_FILTER_TRANSPOSE",\n    "AGGREGATE_REMOVE"\n]\n```', 'time': 7.347705841064453}
