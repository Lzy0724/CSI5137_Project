inefficiencies. The query consists of three common table expressions (CTEs) `ssr`, `csr`, and `wsr`, which are then combined using a `UNION ALL` operation. The final result is aggregated using a `ROLLUP` and ordered with a `LIMIT`.\n\nLet\'s consider the potential optimizations:\n\n1. **Filter Pushdown**: The query has several filter conditions that can be pushed down to reduce the amount of data processed early in the query execution. However, the filters are already applied at the earliest possible point in each CTE, so no further pushdown is possible.\n\n2. **Join Optimization**: The query uses `LEFT OUTER JOIN` operations. We should check if any joins can be removed or simplified. The `AGGREGATE_JOIN_REMOVE` rule could be applicable if the joins do not contribute to the aggregates, but in this case, they do contribute (e.g., `sr_return_amt`, `cr_return_amount`, `wr_return_amt`), so this rule is not applicable.\n\n3. **Aggregation Optimization**: The query uses aggregation functions with `GROUP BY`. The `AGGREGATE_MERGE` rule could be considered if there are nested aggregates, but in this query, each CTE has a single level of aggregation.\n\n4. **Union Optimization**: The `UNION ALL` operation is used to combine results from the three CTEs. The `AGGREGATE_UNION_TRANSPOSE` rule could be considered to push the aggregation past the union, but since the aggregation is already applied within each CTE, this rule is not applicable.\n\n5. **Sort Optimization**: The query uses `ORDER BY` with a `LIMIT`. The `SORT_REMOVE` rule could be considered if the input is already sorted, but this is not the case here.\n\n6. **Constant Reduction**: The query uses constants in the `WHERE` clause, such as `d_date between cast(\'1999-09-30\' as date) and cast(\'1999-09-30\' as date) + interval \'30\' day`. The `FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS` rule could be applied to simplify these expressions.\n\nGiven the analysis, the most applicable optimization is to reduce constants in the filter expressions. Therefore, we will apply the `FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS` rule.\n\n### Applying the Rule:\n\n1. **FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS**: Simplify the date range filter expressions in each CTE.\n\n   - Original: `d_date between cast(\'1999-09-30\' as date) and cast(\'1999-09-30\' as date) + interval \'30\' day`\n   - Simplified: `d_date between date \'1999-09-30\' and date \'1999-10-30\'`\n\n   Apply this simplification to each CTE (`ssr`, `csr`, `wsr`).\n\nAfter applying the rule, the optimized query is:\n\n```sql\nwith ssr as\n (select  s_store_id as store_id,\n          sum(ss_ext_sales_price) as sales,\n          sum(coalesce(sr_return_amt, 0)) as "returns",\n          sum(ss_net_profit - coalesce(sr_net_loss, 0)) as profit\n  from store_sales left outer join store_returns on\n         (ss_item_sk = sr_item_sk and ss_ticket_number = sr_ticket_number),\n     date_dim,\n     store,\n     item,\n     promotion\n where ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk\n       and d_date between date \'1999-09-30\' and date \'1999-10-30\'\n       and ss_store_sk = s_store_sk\n       and ss_item_sk = i_item_sk\n       and i_current_price > 50\n       and ss_promo_sk = p_promo_sk\n       and p_channel_email = \'Y\'\n       and p_channel_tv = \'Y\'\n       and p_channel_radio = \'N\'\n       and p_channel_press = \'Y\'\n       and p_channel_event = \'Y\'\n       and ss_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 74 AND 89\n       and i_category IN (\'Books\', \'Electronics\')\n group by s_store_id)\n ,\n csr as\n (select  cp_catalog_page_id as catalog_page_id,\n          sum(cs_ext_sales_price) as sales,\n          sum(coalesce(cr_return_amount, 0)) as "returns",\n          sum(cs_net_profit - coalesce(cr_net_loss, 0)) as profit\n  from catalog_sales left outer join catalog_returns on\n         (cs_item_sk = cr_item_sk and cs_order_number = cr_order_number),\n     date_dim,\n     catalog_page,\n     item,\n     promotion\n where cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk\n       and d_date between date \'1999-09-30\' and date \'1999-10-30\'\n        and cs_catalog_page_sk = cp_catalog_page_sk\n       and cs_item_sk = i_item_sk\n       and i_current_price > 50\n       and cs_promo_sk = p_promo_sk\n       and p_channel_email = \'Y\'\n       and p_channel_tv = \'Y\'\n       and p_channel_radio = \'N\'\n       and p_channel_press = \'Y\'\n       and p_channel_event = \'Y\'\n       and cs_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 74 AND 89\n       and i_category IN (\'Books\', \'Electronics\')\ngroup by cp_catalog_page_id)\n ,\n wsr as\n (select  web_site_id,\n          sum(ws_ext_sales_price) as sales,\n          sum(coalesce(wr_return_amt, 0)) as "returns",\n          sum(ws_net_profit - coalesce(wr_net_loss, 0)) as profit\n  from web_sales left outer join web_returns on\n         (ws_item_sk = wr_item_sk and ws_order_number = wr_order_number),\n     date_dim,\n     web_site,\n     item,\n     promotion\n where ws_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk\n       and d_date between date \'1999-09-30\' and date \'1999-10-30\'\n        and ws_web_site_sk = web_site_sk\n       and ws_item_sk = i_item_sk\n       and i_current_price > 50\n       and ws_promo_sk = p_promo_sk\n       and p_channel_email = \'Y\'\n       and p_channel_tv = \'Y\'\n       and p_channel_radio = \'N\'\n       and p_channel_press = \'Y\'\n       and p_channel_event = \'Y\'\n       and ws_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 74 AND 89\n       and i_category IN (\'Books\', \'Electronics\')\ngroup by web_site_id)\n  select  channel\n        , id\n        , sum(sales) as sales\n        , sum("returns") as "returns"\n        , sum(profit) as profit\n from\n (select \'store channel\' as channel\n        , \'store\' || store_id as id\n        , sales\n        , "returns"\n        , profit\n from   ssr\n union all\n select \'catalog channel\' as channel\n        , \'catalog_page\' || catalog_page_id as id\n        , sales\n        , "returns"\n        , profit\n from  csr\n union all\n select \'web channel\' as channel\n        , \'web_site\' || web_site_id as id\n        , sales\n        , "returns"\n        , profit\n from   wsr\n ) x\n group by rollup (channel, id)\n order by channel\n         ,id\n limit 100;\n```\n\nThe selected rule for optimization is:\n\n```python\n["FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS"]\n```', 'time': 12.138522148132324}
