inefficiencies. The query involves multiple common table expressions (CTEs), joins, and subqueries. Let\'s break down the query and see where we can apply the rewrite rules:\n\n1. **frequent_ss_items CTE**: This CTE involves a join between `store_sales`, `date_dim`, and `item` tables, followed by a `GROUP BY` and `HAVING` clause. The `HAVING` clause filters out groups with a count greater than 4.\n\n2. **max_store_sales CTE**: This CTE calculates the maximum sales for customers in 1999 with a specific wholesale cost range. It involves a subquery with a `GROUP BY` clause.\n\n3. **best_ss_customer CTE**: This CTE calculates the sum of sales for customers born between 1932 and 1938, and filters based on a percentage of the maximum sales calculated in the `max_store_sales` CTE.\n\n4. **Main Query**: The main query calculates the sum of sales from `catalog_sales` and `web_sales` for March 1999, with conditions on item and customer keys derived from the `frequent_ss_items` and `best_ss_customer` CTEs.\n\n### Potential Optimizations:\n\n- **Join Conditions**: We can look into pushing filters into join conditions to reduce the number of rows processed in joins.\n- **Filter and Aggregate Transpositions**: Transposing filters and aggregates can help in reducing the data processed at each stage.\n- **Subquery Optimization**: The subqueries in the `best_ss_customer` CTE can be optimized by evaluating if they can be simplified or merged.\n\n### Selected Rewrite Rules:\n\n1. **FILTER_INTO_JOIN**: This rule can be applied to push filter conditions into join conditions, potentially reducing the number of rows processed in joins.\n\n2. **FILTER_AGGREGATE_TRANSPOSE**: This rule can be applied to transpose filters and aggregates, allowing filters to be applied earlier in the query execution.\n\n3. **AGGREGATE_FILTER_TRANSPOSE**: This rule can be applied to transpose aggregates and filters, pushing aggregates below filters to reduce the number of rows aggregated.\n\nLet\'s apply these rules step by step:\n\n1. **Apply FILTER_INTO_JOIN**: Push filter conditions from the `WHERE` clause into the join conditions in the `frequent_ss_items` and `max_store_sales` CTEs.\n\n2. **Apply FILTER_AGGREGATE_TRANSPOSE**: Transpose filters and aggregates in the `frequent_ss_items` CTE to apply filters before aggregation.\n\n3. **Apply AGGREGATE_FILTER_TRANSPOSE**: Transpose aggregates and filters in the `best_ss_customer` CTE to apply filters before aggregation.\n\nAfter applying these rules, the query should be more efficient by reducing the number of rows processed at each stage.\n\n```python\n[\n    "FILTER_INTO_JOIN",\n    "FILTER_AGGREGATE_TRANSPOSE",\n    "AGGREGATE_FILTER_TRANSPOSE"\n]\n```', 'time': 6.65220308303833}
