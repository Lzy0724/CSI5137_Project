inefficiencies. The query involves multiple subqueries, joins, and aggregations. Let\'s break down the query and see which rules can be applied to improve its performance.\n\n### Analysis of the Query:\n\n1. **Common Table Expression (CTE) `wss`:** \n   - This CTE aggregates sales data by week and store, with conditional sums for each day of the week.\n   - The `CASE` statements in the aggregation can be optimized using the `AGGREGATE_CASE_TO_FILTER` rule, which converts `CASE`-style filtered aggregates into true filtered aggregates.\n\n2. **Main Query:**\n   - The main query involves two subqueries (`y` and `x`) that are joined on `s_store_id` and `d_week_seq`.\n   - Both subqueries perform similar operations on the `wss` CTE, `store`, and `date_dim` tables.\n   - The join condition includes a time offset (`d_week_seq1=d_week_seq2-52`), which is a straightforward equality condition.\n   - The query uses a `LIMIT` clause, which is efficient for reducing the result set size.\n\n3. **Potential Optimizations:**\n   - **Filter Pushdown:** The filters on `d_month_seq` and `s_state` can be pushed down to reduce the data processed in the joins.\n   - **Join Condition Optimization:** The join condition is already simple, but ensuring that filters are applied before the join can improve performance.\n   - **Aggregation Optimization:** The `AGGREGATE_CASE_TO_FILTER` rule can be applied to the CTE to optimize the aggregation logic.\n\n### Selected Rewrite Rules:\n\n1. **AGGREGATE_CASE_TO_FILTER:** This rule will optimize the aggregation in the CTE by converting `CASE` statements into true filtered aggregates.\n\n2. **FILTER_INTO_JOIN:** This rule will push filter conditions into the join, ensuring that only relevant data is joined, which can improve performance.\n\n### Step-by-Step Transformation:\n\n1. **Apply `AGGREGATE_CASE_TO_FILTER`:**\n\n   Transform the `CASE` statements in the `wss` CTE to use filtered aggregates:\n\n   ```sql\n   with wss as (\n     select d_week_seq,\n            ss_store_sk,\n            sum(ss_sales_price) filter (where d_day_name=\'Sunday\') as sun_sales,\n            sum(ss_sales_price) filter (where d_day_name=\'Monday\') as mon_sales,\n            sum(ss_sales_price) filter (where d_day_name=\'Tuesday\') as tue_sales,\n            sum(ss_sales_price) filter (where d_day_name=\'Wednesday\') as wed_sales,\n            sum(ss_sales_price) filter (where d_day_name=\'Thursday\') as thu_sales,\n            sum(ss_sales_price) filter (where d_day_name=\'Friday\') as fri_sales,\n            sum(ss_sales_price) filter (where d_day_name=\'Saturday\') as sat_sales\n     from store_sales, date_dim\n     where d_date_sk = ss_sold_date_sk\n       and ss_sales_price / ss_list_price BETWEEN 0.77 AND 0.97\n     group by d_week_seq, ss_store_sk\n   )\n   ```\n\n2. **Apply `FILTER_INTO_JOIN`:**\n\n   Push the filters on `d_month_seq` and `s_state` into the join conditions in both subqueries `y` and `x`:\n\n   ```sql\n   select s_store_name1, s_store_id1, d_week_seq1,\n          sun_sales1/sun_sales2, mon_sales1/mon_sales2,\n          tue_sales1/tue_sales2, wed_sales1/wed_sales2, thu_sales1/thu_sales2,\n          fri_sales1/fri_sales2, sat_sales1/sat_sales2\n   from (\n     select s_store_name s_store_name1, wss.d_week_seq d_week_seq1,\n            s_store_id s_store_id1, sun_sales sun_sales1,\n            mon_sales mon_sales1, tue_sales tue_sales1,\n            wed_sales wed_sales1, thu_sales thu_sales1,\n            fri_sales fri_sales1, sat_sales sat_sales1\n     from wss\n     join store on ss_store_sk = s_store_sk\n     join date_dim d on d.d_week_seq = wss.d_week_seq\n     where d_month_seq between 1212 and 1223\n       and s_state in (\'GA\', \'IA\', \'IL\', \'KS\', \'LA\', \'ME\', \'MI\', \'NC\')\n   ) y\n   join (\n     select s_store_name s_store_name2, wss.d_week_seq d_week_seq2,\n            s_store_id s_store_id2, sun_sales sun_sales2,\n            mon_sales mon_sales2, tue_sales tue_sales2,\n            wed_sales wed_sales2, thu_sales thu_sales2,\n            fri_sales fri_sales2, sat_sales sat_sales2\n     from wss\n     join store on ss_store_sk = s_store_sk\n     join date_dim d on d.d_week_seq = wss.d_week_seq\n     where d_month_seq between 1224 and 1235\n       and s_state in (\'GA\', \'IA\', \'IL\', \'KS\', \'LA\', \'ME\', \'MI\', \'NC\')\n   ) x\n   on s_store_id1 = s_store_id2\n   and d_week_seq1 = d_week_seq2 - 52\n   order by s_store_name1, s_store_id1, d_week_seq1\n   limit 100;\n   ```\n\n### Final Optimized Query:\n\nThe final optimized query incorporates the above transformations, resulting in a more efficient execution plan by reducing unnecessary computations and ensuring that filters are applied early in the query execution.\n\n```python\n[\n    "AGGREGATE_CASE_TO_FILTER",\n    "FILTER_INTO_JOIN"\n]\n```', 'time': 10.619558811187744}
