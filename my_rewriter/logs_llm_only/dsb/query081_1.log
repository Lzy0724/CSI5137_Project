inefficiencies. The query involves a common table expression (CTE) `customer_total_return`, which aggregates data from multiple tables, and a main query that filters and orders the results based on this CTE.\n\n### Analysis of the Query:\n\n1. **CTE `customer_total_return`:**\n   - The CTE aggregates data from `catalog_returns`, `date_dim`, and `customer_address` tables.\n   - It filters data for the year 1998 and groups by `cr_returning_customer_sk` and `ca_state`.\n\n2. **Main Query:**\n   - The main query joins the CTE with `customer_address` and `customer` tables.\n   - It filters results where `ctr_total_return` is greater than 1.2 times the average `ctr_total_return` for the same state.\n   - It further filters for `ca_state = \'ME\'` and orders the results by multiple columns.\n\n### Potential Optimizations:\n\n- **Filter Pushdown:** The filter `ca_state = \'ME\'` can be pushed down into the CTE to reduce the amount of data processed in the main query.\n- **Join Condition Optimization:** Ensure that join conditions are optimal and that unnecessary joins are removed.\n- **Subquery Optimization:** The subquery calculating the average `ctr_total_return` can be optimized if possible.\n\n### Applicable Rewrite Rules:\n\n1. **FILTER_INTO_JOIN:** This rule can push filter expressions into join conditions, potentially reducing the data processed in joins.\n2. **FILTER_AGGREGATE_TRANSPOSE:** This rule can push filters past aggregates, which might help in reducing the data processed in the CTE.\n3. **JOIN_CONDITION_PUSH:** This rule can push predicates in a join into the inputs to the join, optimizing the join operation.\n\n### Applying the Rules:\n\n1. **FILTER_AGGREGATE_TRANSPOSE:** Push the filter `ca_state = \'ME\'` into the CTE to reduce the data processed in the main query.\n2. **FILTER_INTO_JOIN:** Push the filter `ca_state = \'ME\'` into the join condition to further optimize the join.\n3. **JOIN_CONDITION_PUSH:** Ensure that join predicates are pushed into the inputs to optimize the join operation.\n\n### Transformed Query:\n\n```sql\nwith customer_total_return as\n (select cr_returning_customer_sk as ctr_customer_sk\n        ,ca_state as ctr_state, \n \tsum(cr_return_amt_inc_tax) as ctr_total_return\n from catalog_returns\n     ,date_dim\n     ,customer_address\n where cr_returned_date_sk = d_date_sk \n   and d_year =1998\n   and cr_returning_addr_sk = ca_address_sk \n   and ca_state = \'ME\'\n group by cr_returning_customer_sk\n         ,ca_state )\n  select  c_customer_id,c_salutation,c_first_name,c_last_name,ca_street_number,ca_street_name\n                   ,ca_street_type,ca_suite_number,ca_city,ca_county,ca_state,ca_zip,ca_country,ca_gmt_offset\n                  ,ca_location_type,ctr_total_return\n from customer_total_return ctr1\n     ,customer_address\n     ,customer\n where ctr1.ctr_total_return > (select avg(ctr_total_return)*1.2\n \t\t\t  from customer_total_return ctr2 \n                  \t  where ctr1.ctr_state = ctr2.ctr_state)\n       and ca_address_sk = c_current_addr_sk\n       and ctr1.ctr_customer_sk = c_customer_sk\n order by c_customer_id,c_salutation,c_first_name,c_last_name,ca_street_number,ca_street_name\n                   ,ca_street_type,ca_suite_number,ca_city,ca_county,ca_state,ca_zip,ca_country,ca_gmt_offset\n                  ,ca_location_type,ctr_total_return\n limit 100;\n```\n\n### Selected Rewrite Rules:\n\n```python\n[\n    "FILTER_AGGREGATE_TRANSPOSE",\n    "FILTER_INTO_JOIN",\n    "JOIN_CONDITION_PUSH"\n]\n```\n\nThese rules help in pushing filters down into the CTE and join conditions, optimizing the query by reducing the amount of data processed at each step.', 'time': 6.8205554485321045}
