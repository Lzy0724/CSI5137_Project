rewrite rules can be applied to improve its performance. The query involves multiple tables joined together with specific filter conditions and an order by clause. Let\'s break down the query and see which rules can be applied:\n\n1. **Join Optimization**: The query uses implicit joins (comma-separated tables in the FROM clause), which can be inefficient. We should consider transforming these into explicit JOINs with ON conditions. However, none of the provided rules directly address this transformation.\n\n2. **Filter Optimization**: The query has several filter conditions in the WHERE clause. We can look for rules that optimize filter conditions or push them down into joins.\n\n3. **Projection Optimization**: The query selects specific columns and uses expressions like `coalesce`. We should check if there are rules that optimize projections.\n\n4. **Sort Optimization**: The query uses an `ORDER BY` clause. We should check if there are rules that optimize sorting.\n\nGiven the provided rules, let\'s identify the applicable ones:\n\n- **FILTER_INTO_JOIN**: This rule tries to push filter expressions into a join condition and into the inputs of the join. This can be beneficial for optimizing the join conditions in the query.\n\n- **JOIN_CONDITION_PUSH**: This rule pushes predicates in a Join into the inputs to the join. This can help in optimizing the join conditions further.\n\n- **PROJECT_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS**: This rule reduces constants inside a LogicalProject. It can optimize expressions like `coalesce`.\n\n- **SORT_REMOVE**: This rule removes a Sort if its input is already sorted. However, since the query explicitly orders by `c_customer_id`, this rule might not be applicable unless we know the data is pre-sorted.\n\nLet\'s apply these rules step by step:\n\n1. **Apply FILTER_INTO_JOIN**: Push filter conditions into the join conditions to optimize the join process.\n\n2. **Apply JOIN_CONDITION_PUSH**: Further optimize join conditions by pushing predicates into the join inputs.\n\n3. **Apply PROJECT_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS**: Optimize the projection expressions, particularly the `coalesce` function.\n\nAfter applying these rules, the query should be more efficient in terms of join processing and expression evaluation. Here\'s the list of selected rules:\n\n```python\n[\n    "FILTER_INTO_JOIN",\n    "JOIN_CONDITION_PUSH",\n    "PROJECT_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS"\n]\n```\n\nThese rules are selected based on their potential to optimize the query\'s join conditions and projection expressions, which are critical for improving performance in this context.', 'time': 5.7867841720581055}
