inefficiencies. The query involves multiple joins, aggregations, and filtering conditions. Let\'s consider the provided rewrite rules and determine which ones can be applied to improve the query\'s performance.\n\n### Analysis of the Query:\n\n1. **Joins**: The query involves several joins, including inner joins and left outer joins. The joins are on various keys, and some of them are on date dimensions, which might be large tables.\n\n2. **Aggregations**: The query uses aggregations with `SUM` and `COUNT` functions. The `CASE` statements in the `SUM` functions can be optimized using filtered aggregates.\n\n3. **Filters**: There are multiple filtering conditions in the `WHERE` clause, which can potentially be pushed down to reduce the data processed by the joins and aggregations.\n\n4. **Ordering and Limiting**: The query orders the results by `total_cnt` and other columns, and limits the output to 100 rows.\n\n### Applicable Rewrite Rules:\n\n1. **AGGREGATE_CASE_TO_FILTER**: This rule can convert `CASE`-style filtered aggregates into true filtered aggregates, which can improve performance by reducing the complexity of the aggregation.\n\n2. **FILTER_INTO_JOIN**: This rule can push filter expressions into join conditions, potentially reducing the size of intermediate results and improving join performance.\n\n3. **JOIN_CONDITION_PUSH**: This rule can push predicates in a join into the inputs to the join, which can help in reducing the data size before the join operation.\n\n### Optimization Steps:\n\n1. **Apply AGGREGATE_CASE_TO_FILTER**: Convert the `CASE` statements in the `SUM` functions to use filtered aggregates. This simplifies the aggregation logic and can improve performance.\n\n2. **Apply FILTER_INTO_JOIN**: Push applicable filter conditions into the join conditions to reduce the amount of data processed by the joins.\n\n3. **Apply JOIN_CONDITION_PUSH**: Push join predicates into the inputs of the join to further reduce the data size before the join operation.\n\nBy applying these rules, we can optimize the query to be more efficient in terms of data processing and execution time.\n\n### Optimized Query:\n\n```sql\nselect  i_item_desc\n      ,w_warehouse_name\n      ,d1.d_week_seq\n      ,sum(1) filter (where p_promo_sk is null) as no_promo\n      ,sum(1) filter (where p_promo_sk is not null) as promo\n      ,count(*) total_cnt\nfrom catalog_sales\njoin inventory on (cs_item_sk = inv_item_sk)\njoin warehouse on (w_warehouse_sk=inv_warehouse_sk)\njoin item on (i_item_sk = cs_item_sk)\njoin customer_demographics on (cs_bill_cdemo_sk = cd_demo_sk)\njoin household_demographics on (cs_bill_hdemo_sk = hd_demo_sk)\njoin date_dim d1 on (cs_sold_date_sk = d1.d_date_sk)\njoin date_dim d2 on (inv_date_sk = d2.d_date_sk)\njoin date_dim d3 on (cs_ship_date_sk = d3.d_date_sk)\nleft outer join promotion on (cs_promo_sk=p_promo_sk)\nleft outer join catalog_returns on (cr_item_sk = cs_item_sk and cr_order_number = cs_order_number)\nwhere d1.d_week_seq = d2.d_week_seq\n  and inv_quantity_on_hand < cs_quantity\n  and d3.d_date > d1.d_date + interval \'3\' day\n  and hd_buy_potential = \'1001-5000\'\n  and d1.d_year = 1999\n  and cd_marital_status = \'M\'\n  and cd_dep_count between 6 and 8\n  and i_category IN (\'Books\', \'Jewelry\', \'Shoes\')\n  and cs_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 73 AND 93\ngroup by i_item_desc,w_warehouse_name,d1.d_week_seq\norder by total_cnt desc, i_item_desc, w_warehouse_name, d_week_seq\nlimit 100;\n```\n\n### Selected Rewrite Rules:\n\n```python\n[\n    "AGGREGATE_CASE_TO_FILTER",\n    "FILTER_INTO_JOIN",\n    "JOIN_CONDITION_PUSH"\n]\n```', 'time': 7.334980010986328}
