WINDOW_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS:\n"""Rule that reduces constants inside a LogicalWindow."""'}], 'response': 'To optimize the given SQL query, we need to analyze the query structure and identify potential inefficiencies. The query involves a join between three tables (`catalog_sales`, `item`, and `date_dim`) and a subquery that calculates an average value. The main query filters rows based on conditions and orders the results.\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **Join Conditions**: The query uses implicit joins in the `WHERE` clause. Converting these to explicit `JOIN` clauses can improve readability and potentially allow the optimizer to better understand the join structure.\n2. **Subquery**: The subquery calculates an average and is used in a comparison. This could be optimized by ensuring it is executed efficiently.\n3. **Order By**: The query orders by `sum(cs_ext_discount_amt)`, which is necessary for the `LIMIT` clause. However, if the input is already sorted, the sort operation can be removed.\n\n### Applicable Rules:\n1. **FILTER_INTO_JOIN**: This rule can push filter expressions into the join condition, potentially reducing the number of rows early in the execution plan.\n2. **JOIN_CONDITION_PUSH**: This rule pushes predicates in a join into the inputs to the join, which can help reduce the data size before the join operation.\n3. **SORT_REMOVE**: If the input to the sort operation is already sorted, this rule can remove the sort operation.\n\n### Optimization Steps:\n1. **Convert Implicit Joins to Explicit Joins**: This is a manual step to improve readability and potentially help the optimizer.\n2. **Apply FILTER_INTO_JOIN**: Push filter conditions into the join to reduce the number of rows early.\n3. **Apply JOIN_CONDITION_PUSH**: Push join predicates into the inputs to further reduce data size before the join.\n4. **Apply SORT_REMOVE**: If applicable, remove the sort operation if the input is already sorted.\n\nLet\'s apply these steps:\n\n1. **Convert Implicit Joins to Explicit Joins**:\n   ```sql\n   SELECT SUM(cs_ext_discount_amt) AS "excess discount amount"\n   FROM catalog_sales\n   JOIN item ON i_item_sk = cs_item_sk\n   JOIN date_dim ON d_date_sk = cs_sold_date_sk\n   WHERE (i_manufact_id IN (15, 261, 343, 512, 683) OR i_manager_id BETWEEN 25 AND 54)\n     AND d_date BETWEEN \'2001-02-05\' AND CAST(\'2001-02-05\' AS DATE) + INTERVAL \'90\' DAY\n     AND cs_ext_discount_amt > (\n       SELECT 1.3 * AVG(cs_ext_discount_amt)\n       FROM catalog_sales\n       JOIN date_dim ON d_date_sk = cs_sold_date_sk\n       WHERE cs_item_sk = i_item_sk\n         AND d_date BETWEEN \'2001-02-05\' AND CAST(\'2001-02-05\' AS DATE) + INTERVAL \'90\' DAY\n         AND cs_list_price BETWEEN 259 AND 288\n         AND cs_sales_price / cs_list_price BETWEEN 0.17 AND 0.37\n     )\n   ORDER BY SUM(cs_ext_discount_amt)\n   LIMIT 100;\n   ```\n\n2. **Apply FILTER_INTO_JOIN**:\n   - Push the filter conditions `(i_manufact_id IN (15, 261, 343, 512, 683) OR i_manager_id BETWEEN 25 AND 54)` into the join with `item`.\n\n3. **Apply JOIN_CONDITION_PUSH**:\n   - Push the join condition `d_date_sk = cs_sold_date_sk` into the `date_dim` table to filter rows early.\n\n4. **Apply SORT_REMOVE**:\n   - Check if the input to the sort operation is already sorted. If so, remove the sort operation. However, in this case, we need the sort for the `LIMIT` clause, so this rule may not apply.\n\nAfter applying these rules, the query is optimized for performance by reducing the number of rows processed in joins and ensuring efficient execution of the subquery.\n\n### Selected Rules:\n```python\n["FILTER_INTO_JOIN", "JOIN_CONDITION_PUSH"]\n```\n\nThese rules are selected based on their potential to improve the query\'s performance by reducing the number of rows processed early in the execution plan.', 'time': 10.18814730644226}
