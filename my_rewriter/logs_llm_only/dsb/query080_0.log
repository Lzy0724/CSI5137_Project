inefficiencies. The query involves multiple common table expressions (CTEs) and a final aggregation with a `ROLLUP`. The query is already quite structured, but there are a few areas where we can apply optimization rules:\n\n1. **FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS**: This rule can be applied to reduce constants inside a filter. In the query, the date filter `d_date between cast(\'2000-06-06\' as date) and cast(\'2000-06-06\' as date) + interval \'30\' day` can be simplified to `d_date between \'2000-06-06\' and \'2000-07-06\'`.\n\n2. **FILTER_INTO_JOIN**: This rule attempts to push filter expressions into join conditions. The query has several joins where filters can be pushed down to improve performance.\n\n3. **PROJECT_REMOVE**: This rule can be applied if a project node merely returns its input. In the final selection, the `channel` and `id` are derived directly from the CTEs without additional computation, so this rule might be applicable.\n\n4. **AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE**: This rule can be applied to merge an aggregate with a project if possible. In the final aggregation, the `ROLLUP` might be simplified by merging with the project.\n\nLet\'s apply these rules step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Apply FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS\nSimplify the date filter in each CTE:\n```sql\nd_date between \'2000-06-06\' and \'2000-07-06\'\n```\n\n### Step 2: Apply FILTER_INTO_JOIN\nPush filter conditions into join conditions where applicable. This involves analyzing each join and ensuring that filters are applied as early as possible.\n\n### Step 3: Apply PROJECT_REMOVE\nCheck if any project nodes can be removed because they merely return their input. In this case, the final selection of `channel` and `id` might be simplified.\n\n### Step 4: Apply AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE\nMerge the final aggregation with the project if possible, especially focusing on the `ROLLUP`.\n\nAfter applying these rules, the query should be more efficient. Here is the list of rules applied:\n\n```python\n[\n    "FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS",\n    "FILTER_INTO_JOIN",\n    "PROJECT_REMOVE",\n    "AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE"\n]\n```\n\nThese steps should help in optimizing the query by reducing unnecessary computations and pushing filters and projections to more optimal positions in the query execution plan.', 'time': 5.550640106201172}
