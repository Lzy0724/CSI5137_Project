inefficiencies. The query involves multiple joins, a group by operation, and several case statements within aggregate functions. The goal is to apply the most relevant query rewrite rules to improve performance.\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **Joins**: The query uses multiple joins between `store_sales`, `store_returns`, `store`, and two instances of `date_dim`. The join conditions are based on equality and date range checks.\n2. **Aggregations**: The query uses `SUM` with `CASE` statements to count occurrences within specific date ranges.\n3. **Filters**: There are filters on `d2.d_year` and `d2.d_moy`.\n4. **Group By and Order By**: The query groups and orders by several columns from the `store` table.\n\n### Potential Optimizations:\n- **Convert CASE to Filtered Aggregates**: The `CASE` statements within the `SUM` functions can be converted to filtered aggregates for better performance.\n- **Push Filters into Joins**: Filters on `d2` can be pushed into the join conditions to reduce the data processed in joins.\n- **Transpose Aggregates and Filters**: If possible, transpose aggregates and filters to minimize the data processed by the aggregate functions.\n\n### Selected Rules:\n1. **AGGREGATE_CASE_TO_FILTER**: Convert `CASE` statements in aggregates to filtered aggregates.\n2. **FILTER_INTO_JOIN**: Push filter conditions into join conditions to reduce the data processed by joins.\n\n### Transformation Steps:\n\n1. **Apply AGGREGATE_CASE_TO_FILTER**:\n   - Convert the `CASE` statements in the `SUM` functions to filtered aggregates.\n   - Example transformation:\n     ```sql\n     SUM(CASE WHEN (sr_returned_date_sk - ss_sold_date_sk <= 30) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS "30 days"\n     ```\n     becomes\n     ```sql\n     SUM(1) FILTER (WHERE sr_returned_date_sk - ss_sold_date_sk <= 30) AS "30 days"\n     ```\n\n2. **Apply FILTER_INTO_JOIN**:\n   - Push the filter conditions on `d2` into the join conditions.\n   - Example transformation:\n     ```sql\n     AND d2.d_year = 1999\n     AND d2.d_moy = 4\n     ```\n     becomes part of the join condition with `date_dim d2`.\n\n### Optimized Query:\n```sql\nSELECT \n   s_store_name,\n   s_company_id,\n   s_street_number,\n   s_street_name,\n   s_street_type,\n   s_suite_number,\n   s_city,\n   s_county,\n   s_state,\n   s_zip,\n   SUM(1) FILTER (WHERE sr_returned_date_sk - ss_sold_date_sk <= 30) AS "30 days",\n   SUM(1) FILTER (WHERE sr_returned_date_sk - ss_sold_date_sk > 30 AND sr_returned_date_sk - ss_sold_date_sk <= 60) AS "31-60 days",\n   SUM(1) FILTER (WHERE sr_returned_date_sk - ss_sold_date_sk > 60 AND sr_returned_date_sk - ss_sold_date_sk <= 90) AS "61-90 days",\n   SUM(1) FILTER (WHERE sr_returned_date_sk - ss_sold_date_sk > 90 AND sr_returned_date_sk - ss_sold_date_sk <= 120) AS "91-120 days",\n   SUM(1) FILTER (WHERE sr_returned_date_sk - ss_sold_date_sk > 120) AS ">120 days"\nFROM\n   store_sales,\n   store_returns,\n   store,\n   date_dim d1,\n   date_dim d2\nWHERE\n   ss_ticket_number = sr_ticket_number\n   AND ss_item_sk = sr_item_sk\n   AND ss_sold_date_sk = d1.d_date_sk\n   AND sr_returned_date_sk = d2.d_date_sk\n   AND ss_customer_sk = sr_customer_sk\n   AND ss_store_sk = s_store_sk\n   AND d1.d_date BETWEEN (d2.d_date - INTERVAL \'120\' DAY) AND d2.d_date\n   AND d2.d_year = 1999\n   AND d2.d_moy = 4\nGROUP BY\n   s_store_name,\n   s_company_id,\n   s_street_number,\n   s_street_name,\n   s_street_type,\n   s_suite_number,\n   s_city,\n   s_county,\n   s_state,\n   s_zip\nORDER BY \n   s_store_name,\n   s_company_id,\n   s_street_number,\n   s_street_name,\n   s_street_type,\n   s_suite_number,\n   s_city,\n   s_county,\n   s_state,\n   s_zip\nLIMIT 100;\n```\n\n### Selected Rules:\n```python\n[\n    "AGGREGATE_CASE_TO_FILTER",\n    "FILTER_INTO_JOIN"\n]\n```', 'time': 8.077000141143799}
