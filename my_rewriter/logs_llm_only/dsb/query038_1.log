inefficiencies. The query involves multiple `INTERSECT` operations and a `DISTINCT` clause within subqueries. The `INTERSECT` operation inherently ensures distinctness, so the `DISTINCT` clause is redundant. Additionally, the `INTERSECT` operation can be optimized by transforming it into a series of `JOIN` operations, which are generally more efficient.\n\nLet\'s apply the relevant query rewrite rules:\n\n1. **INTERSECT_TO_DISTINCT**: This rule translates a distinct `INTERSECT` into a group of operators composed of `UNION`, `AGGREGATE`, etc. However, in this context, it can be more efficient to directly convert the `INTERSECT` into `JOIN` operations, which is a common optimization technique.\n\n2. **AGGREGATE_REMOVE**: This rule removes an `Aggregate` if it computes no aggregate functions (i.e., it is implementing `SELECT DISTINCT`), or all the aggregate functions are splittable, and the underlying relational expression is already distinct. Since `INTERSECT` ensures distinctness, we can remove the `DISTINCT` clause.\n\n3. **FILTER_INTO_JOIN**: This rule tries to push filter expressions into a join condition and into the inputs of the join. This can help optimize the query by reducing the number of rows early in the execution plan.\n\nLet\'s apply these rules step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Remove Redundant DISTINCT\nThe `DISTINCT` clause in each subquery is redundant because `INTERSECT` already ensures distinctness. We can remove it using the `AGGREGATE_REMOVE` rule.\n\n### Step 2: Convert INTERSECT to JOIN\nConvert the `INTERSECT` operations into `JOIN` operations. This can be done by joining the results of the subqueries on the common columns (`c_last_name`, `c_first_name`, `d_date`). This transformation is more efficient for execution.\n\n### Step 3: Push Filters into Joins\nUse the `FILTER_INTO_JOIN` rule to push filter conditions into the join operations. This helps in reducing the number of rows processed by the join, improving performance.\n\nHere\'s the optimized query after applying the rules:\n\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*)\nFROM (\n    SELECT c_last_name, c_first_name, d_date\n    FROM store_sales\n    JOIN date_dim ON store_sales.ss_sold_date_sk = date_dim.d_date_sk\n    JOIN customer ON store_sales.ss_customer_sk = customer.c_customer_sk\n    WHERE d_month_seq BETWEEN 1190 AND 1201\n      AND c_birth_month IN (1, 5, 9, 11)\n      AND ss_list_price BETWEEN 77 AND 136\n      AND ss_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 80 AND 100\n) ss\nJOIN (\n    SELECT c_last_name, c_first_name, d_date\n    FROM catalog_sales\n    JOIN date_dim ON catalog_sales.cs_sold_date_sk = date_dim.d_date_sk\n    JOIN customer ON catalog_sales.cs_bill_customer_sk = customer.c_customer_sk\n    WHERE d_month_seq BETWEEN 1190 AND 1201\n      AND c_birth_month IN (1, 5, 9, 11)\n      AND cs_list_price BETWEEN 77 AND 136\n      AND cs_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 80 AND 100\n) cs ON ss.c_last_name = cs.c_last_name\n    AND ss.c_first_name = cs.c_first_name\n    AND ss.d_date = cs.d_date\nJOIN (\n    SELECT c_last_name, c_first_name, d_date\n    FROM web_sales\n    JOIN date_dim ON web_sales.ws_sold_date_sk = date_dim.d_date_sk\n    JOIN customer ON web_sales.ws_bill_customer_sk = customer.c_customer_sk\n    WHERE d_month_seq BETWEEN 1190 AND 1201\n      AND c_birth_month IN (1, 5, 9, 11)\n      AND ws_list_price BETWEEN 77 AND 136\n      AND ws_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 80 AND 100\n) ws ON ss.c_last_name = ws.c_last_name\n    AND ss.c_first_name = ws.c_first_name\n    AND ss.d_date = ws.d_date\nLIMIT 100;\n```\n\nThe selected rules for optimization are:\n\n```python\n[\n    "AGGREGATE_REMOVE",\n    "FILTER_INTO_JOIN"\n]\n```', 'time': 8.422125577926636}
