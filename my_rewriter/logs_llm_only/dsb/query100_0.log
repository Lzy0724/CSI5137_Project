inefficiencies. The query involves multiple joins, filters, and a group by operation. The goal is to apply rewrite rules that can improve the performance by reducing the complexity of joins, pushing filters down, and optimizing the aggregation.\n\n### Analysis of the Query:\n1. **Joins**: The query involves multiple joins between tables `item`, `store_sales`, `date_dim`, `customer`, `customer_address`, and `customer_demographics`. The join conditions are based on foreign key relationships and other conditions.\n2. **Filters**: There are several filter conditions applied in the `WHERE` clause, which can potentially be pushed down to reduce the number of rows processed in joins.\n3. **Aggregation**: The query performs a `GROUP BY` operation on `item1.i_item_sk` and `item2.i_item_sk` and orders the result by the count.\n\n### Potential Optimization Steps:\n1. **Filter Pushdown**: Push filters as close to the data source as possible to reduce the number of rows processed in joins.\n2. **Join Condition Optimization**: Simplify join conditions and push predicates into the join to reduce the number of rows processed.\n3. **Aggregation Optimization**: Ensure that aggregation is performed efficiently by reducing the number of rows before aggregation.\n\n### Selected Rewrite Rules:\n1. **FILTER_INTO_JOIN**: This rule attempts to push filter expressions into the join condition and into the inputs of the join. This can help reduce the number of rows processed in the join.\n2. **JOIN_CONDITION_PUSH**: This rule pushes predicates in a join into the inputs to the join, which can help in reducing the data size early in the query execution.\n3. **FILTER_AGGREGATE_TRANSPOSE**: This rule pushes a filter past an aggregate, which can help in reducing the number of rows before aggregation.\n\n### Applying the Selected Rules:\n1. **Apply FILTER_INTO_JOIN**: Push filter conditions related to `item1`, `item2`, `store_sales`, and other tables into the respective join conditions.\n2. **Apply JOIN_CONDITION_PUSH**: Push join predicates into the inputs of the join to reduce the number of rows processed.\n3. **Apply FILTER_AGGREGATE_TRANSPOSE**: Push filters past the aggregation to ensure that only relevant rows are aggregated.\n\nBy applying these rules, we aim to reduce the number of rows processed at each stage of the query, thereby improving the overall performance.\n\n```python\n[\n    "FILTER_INTO_JOIN",\n    "JOIN_CONDITION_PUSH",\n    "FILTER_AGGREGATE_TRANSPOSE"\n]\n```', 'time': 7.578526735305786}
