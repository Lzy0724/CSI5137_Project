inefficiencies. The query involves a common table expression (CTE), multiple joins, a subquery, and several filters. Let\'s break down the query and see which rules can be applied to improve its performance.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis and Optimization:\n\n1. **Analyze the CTE and Subquery:**\n   - The CTE `customer_total_return` aggregates data from `store_returns` and `date_dim` tables. It filters data for the year 1999 and a specific range of `sr_return_amt / sr_return_quantity`.\n   - The main query uses this CTE and includes a subquery to calculate an average return amount, which is then used as a filter.\n\n2. **Identify Potential Optimizations:**\n   - **FILTER_AGGREGATE_TRANSPOSE:** This rule can be applied to push filters past aggregates, potentially reducing the amount of data processed by the aggregate.\n   - **FILTER_INTO_JOIN:** This rule can push filter conditions into join conditions, which can help reduce the number of rows processed in the join.\n   - **JOIN_CONDITION_PUSH:** This rule can push predicates in a join into the inputs to the join, which can help in filtering data earlier.\n   - **FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS:** This rule can simplify filter expressions, potentially reducing computational overhead.\n\n3. **Apply the Rules:**\n   - **FILTER_AGGREGATE_TRANSPOSE:** Apply this rule to push the filter `d_year = 1999` past the aggregate in the CTE. This reduces the data processed by the aggregate.\n   - **FILTER_INTO_JOIN:** Apply this rule to push filters like `s_state IN (\'CO\', \'GA\', \'NE\')` and `cd_marital_status IN (\'M\', \'M\')` into the join conditions.\n   - **JOIN_CONDITION_PUSH:** Apply this rule to push join predicates like `ctr1.ctr_customer_sk = c_customer_sk` into the inputs of the join.\n   - **FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS:** Simplify filter expressions such as `cd_marital_status IN (\'M\', \'M\')` to `cd_marital_status = \'M\'`.\n\nBy applying these rules, we can optimize the query to reduce the amount of data processed at each step, leading to improved performance.\n\n### Optimized Query:\n\n```sql\nwith customer_total_return as\n(select sr_customer_sk as ctr_customer_sk\n,sr_store_sk as ctr_store_sk\n,sr_reason_sk as ctr_reason_sk\n,sum(SR_RETURN_AMT_INC_TAX) as ctr_total_return\nfrom store_returns\n,date_dim\nwhere sr_returned_date_sk = d_date_sk\nand d_year =1999\nand sr_return_amt / sr_return_quantity between 80 and 139\ngroup by sr_customer_sk\n,sr_store_sk, sr_reason_sk)\n select  c_customer_id\nfrom customer_total_return ctr1\njoin store on s_store_sk = ctr1.ctr_store_sk and s_state IN (\'CO\', \'GA\', \'NE\')\njoin customer on ctr1.ctr_customer_sk = c_customer_sk\njoin customer_demographics on c_current_cdemo_sk = cd_demo_sk\nwhere ctr1.ctr_total_return > (select avg(ctr_total_return)*1.2\nfrom customer_total_return ctr2\nwhere ctr1.ctr_store_sk = ctr2.ctr_store_sk\n)\nand ctr1.ctr_reason_sk BETWEEN 72 AND 75\nand cd_marital_status = \'M\'\nand cd_education_status = \'2 yr Degree\'\nand cd_gender = \'F\'\nand c_birth_month = 8\nand c_birth_year BETWEEN 1987 AND 1993\norder by c_customer_id\nlimit 100;\n```\n\n### Selected Rules:\n\n```python\n[\n    "FILTER_AGGREGATE_TRANSPOSE",\n    "FILTER_INTO_JOIN",\n    "JOIN_CONDITION_PUSH",\n    "FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS"\n]\n```', 'time': 9.01312804222107}
