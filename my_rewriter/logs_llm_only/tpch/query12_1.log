determine which rules can be applied to improve performance.\n\n### Analysis of the Query:\n1. **Joins and Filters**: The query involves a join between `orders` and `lineitem` tables on `o_orderkey = l_orderkey`. There are several filter conditions applied on `lineitem` columns.\n2. **Aggregations**: The query uses `SUM` with `CASE` statements to count high and low priority orders.\n3. **Grouping and Sorting**: The query groups by `l_shipmode` and orders the result by `l_shipmode`.\n4. **Limit**: The query limits the result to 1 row.\n\n### Potential Optimizations:\n- **Convert CASE to Filtered Aggregates**: The `CASE` statements in the `SUM` functions can be converted to filtered aggregates for better performance.\n- **Filter Pushdown**: Ensure filters are pushed down as much as possible to reduce the data processed by the join and aggregation.\n- **Join Optimization**: Check if any join-related optimizations can be applied.\n\n### Selected Rewrite Rules:\n1. **AGGREGATE_CASE_TO_FILTER**: This rule converts `CASE` statements in aggregates to filtered aggregates, which can improve performance by simplifying the aggregation logic.\n\n### Applying the Selected Rule:\n\n1. **AGGREGATE_CASE_TO_FILTER**:\n   - Convert the `CASE` statements in the `SUM` functions to filtered aggregates:\n   ```sql\n   select\n       l_shipmode,\n       sum(o_orderpriority = \'1-URGENT\' or o_orderpriority = \'2-HIGH\') as high_line_count,\n       sum(o_orderpriority <> \'1-URGENT\' and o_orderpriority <> \'2-HIGH\') as low_line_count\n   from\n       orders,\n       lineitem\n   where\n       o_orderkey = l_orderkey\n       and l_shipmode in (\'FOB\', \'RAIL\')\n       and l_commitdate < l_receiptdate\n       and l_shipdate < l_commitdate\n       and l_receiptdate >= date \'1996-01-01\'\n       and l_receiptdate < date \'1996-01-01\' + interval \'1\' year\n   group by\n       l_shipmode\n   order by\n       l_shipmode\n   limit 1;\n   ```\n\nThis transformation simplifies the aggregation logic by directly using boolean expressions in the `SUM` functions, which can be more efficient for the database engine to process.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe query is optimized by applying the `AGGREGATE_CASE_TO_FILTER` rule, which simplifies the aggregation logic. No other rules are applicable or necessary for further optimization in this context.\n\n```python\n["AGGREGATE_CASE_TO_FILTER"]\n```', 'time': 6.9599480628967285}
