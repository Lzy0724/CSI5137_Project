inefficiencies. The query involves a subquery, aggregation, filtering, and ordering. Let's break down the query and see which rules can be applied to improve its performance.\n\n### Analysis of the Query:\n\n1. **Subquery in FROM Clause**: The subquery filters customers based on phone number prefixes, account balance, and the absence of orders. It also calculates the average account balance for comparison.\n\n2. **Aggregation**: The outer query aggregates the results of the subquery by country code, counting customers and summing account balances.\n\n3. **Ordering and Limiting**: The results are ordered by country code and limited to one row.\n\n### Potential Optimization Steps:\n\n1. **FILTER_AGGREGATE_TRANSPOSE**: This rule can be applied to push the filter conditions inside the subquery past the aggregation. However, in this case, the filter conditions are already applied before aggregation in the subquery, so this rule is not applicable.\n\n2. **AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE**: This rule can be used to merge the aggregation with the projection if possible. However, the subquery's projection is necessary for the aggregation, so this rule is not applicable.\n\n3. **FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS**: This rule reduces constants inside a filter. The subquery's filter conditions are already optimized, so this rule is not applicable.\n\n4. **SORT_REMOVE**: This rule removes a sort if the input is already sorted. The query orders by `cntrycode`, which is the grouping key, so this rule is not applicable.\n\n5. **PROJECT_REMOVE**: This rule removes a project node that merely returns its input. The subquery's projection is necessary for the aggregation, so this rule is not applicable.\n\n6. **AGGREGATE_REMOVE**: This rule removes an aggregate if it computes no aggregate functions or if all functions are splittable and the underlying expression is distinct. The query computes aggregate functions, so this rule is not applicable.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe given query is already optimized in terms of its structure and the operations it performs. The subquery efficiently filters and projects the necessary data before aggregation, and the outer query aggregates and orders the results as required. None of the provided rewrite rules apply to further optimize this query.\n\nTherefore, the best course of action is to leave the query as is, without applying any rewrite rules.\n\n```python\n[]\n```", 'time': 7.223148822784424}
