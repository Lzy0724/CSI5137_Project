determine which rules can be applied to improve performance. The query involves a join between `lineitem` and `part` tables, a filter on `l_shipdate`, and an aggregate function with a `CASE` statement.\n\n### Analysis of the Query:\n1. **Join Condition**: The query joins `lineitem` and `part` on `l_partkey = p_partkey`.\n2. **Filter Condition**: There is a filter on `l_shipdate` to select records within February 1996.\n3. **Aggregate Function**: The query calculates a promotional revenue percentage using a `CASE` statement within the `SUM` function.\n\n### Applicable Rewrite Rules:\n1. **AGGREGATE_CASE_TO_FILTER**: This rule can convert the `CASE` statement in the aggregate function into a more efficient filtered aggregate. This is likely to improve performance by simplifying the aggregate computation.\n\n2. **FILTER_INTO_JOIN**: This rule can push the filter condition on `l_shipdate` into the join condition, potentially reducing the number of rows processed in the join.\n\n### Steps to Optimize the Query:\n1. **Apply AGGREGATE_CASE_TO_FILTER**: Convert the `CASE` statement in the aggregate function into a filtered aggregate. This will make the aggregate computation more efficient.\n\n2. **Apply FILTER_INTO_JOIN**: Push the filter condition on `l_shipdate` into the join condition to reduce the number of rows processed during the join operation.\n\nBy applying these rules, we can optimize the query to improve its performance.\n\n### Optimized Query:\nAfter applying the selected rules, the optimized query would look like this:\n\n```sql\nselect\n\t100.00 * sum(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount) filter (where p_type like \'PROMO%\')) / sum(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)) as promo_revenue\nfrom\n\tlineitem\njoin\n\tpart on l_partkey = p_partkey and l_shipdate >= date \'1996-02-01\' and l_shipdate < date \'1996-02-01\' + interval \'1\' month\nlimit 1;\n```\n\n### Selected Rewrite Rules:\n```python\n[\n    "AGGREGATE_CASE_TO_FILTER",\n    "FILTER_INTO_JOIN"\n]\n```', 'time': 6.167161464691162}
