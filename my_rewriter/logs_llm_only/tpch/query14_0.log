determine which rules can be applied to improve performance.\n\n### Analysis of the Query:\nThe query calculates a promotional revenue percentage by joining the `lineitem` and `part` tables, filtering by a specific date range, and using a `CASE` statement within an aggregate function. The query uses a `LIMIT 1` clause, which suggests that only one result is needed, possibly for a summary or report.\n\n### Potential Optimizations:\n1. **CASE to Filter Conversion**: The `CASE` statement within the `SUM` function can be converted to a filtered aggregate, which can improve performance by reducing the complexity of the aggregation.\n2. **Pull Up Constants**: The constant `100.00` in the calculation can be pulled out of the aggregate function to simplify the computation.\n\n### Selected Rewrite Rules:\n1. **AGGREGATE_CASE_TO_FILTER**: This rule converts `CASE`-style filtered aggregates into true filtered aggregates, which can optimize the aggregation process.\n2. **AGGREGATE_ANY_PULL_UP_CONSTANTS**: This rule can pull up constants from the aggregate function, simplifying the computation.\n\n### Step-by-Step Transformation:\n\n1. **Apply AGGREGATE_CASE_TO_FILTER**:\n   - Convert the `CASE` statement within the `SUM` function to a filtered aggregate:\n   ```sql\n   select\n       100.00 * sum(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount) filter (where p_type like \'PROMO%\')) / sum(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)) as promo_revenue\n   from\n       lineitem,\n       part\n   where\n       l_partkey = p_partkey\n       and l_shipdate >= date \'1995-10-01\'\n       and l_shipdate < date \'1995-10-01\' + interval \'1\' month\n   limit 1;\n   ```\n\n2. **Apply AGGREGATE_ANY_PULL_UP_CONSTANTS**:\n   - Pull the constant `100.00` out of the aggregate function:\n   ```sql\n   select\n       100.00 * (sum(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount) filter (where p_type like \'PROMO%\')) / sum(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount))) as promo_revenue\n   from\n       lineitem,\n       part\n   where\n       l_partkey = p_partkey\n       and l_shipdate >= date \'1995-10-01\'\n       and l_shipdate < date \'1995-10-01\' + interval \'1\' month\n   limit 1;\n   ```\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe optimized query now uses a filtered aggregate instead of a `CASE` statement and has pulled the constant out of the aggregate function, which should improve performance.\n\n```python\n[\n    "AGGREGATE_CASE_TO_FILTER",\n    "AGGREGATE_ANY_PULL_UP_CONSTANTS"\n]\n```', 'time': 6.300106763839722}
