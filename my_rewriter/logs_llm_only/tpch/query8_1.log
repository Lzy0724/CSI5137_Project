The goal is to simplify and optimize these operations using the provided rewrite rules.\n\n### Step-by-step Optimization:\n\n1. **AGGREGATE_CASE_TO_FILTER**: \n   - The query uses a `CASE` statement within the `SUM` function to conditionally sum the `volume` based on the `nation`. This can be optimized by converting the `CASE` statement into a filtered aggregate. This rule will directly improve the performance by reducing the complexity of the aggregate function.\n\n2. **FILTER_INTO_JOIN**:\n   - The query has a complex `WHERE` clause with multiple join conditions and filters. By applying the `FILTER_INTO_JOIN` rule, we can push filter expressions into the join conditions, which can help in reducing the data processed by the joins and improve performance.\n\n3. **JOIN_CONDITION_PUSH**:\n   - This rule can further optimize the join operations by pushing predicates into the inputs of the join. This will help in reducing the intermediate result size and improve the efficiency of the join operations.\n\n4. **PROJECT_JOIN_TRANSPOSE**:\n   - The query involves a projection operation after the joins. By applying the `PROJECT_JOIN_TRANSPOSE` rule, we can push the projection past the join, which can help in reducing the amount of data processed by the join operations.\n\n5. **SORT_REMOVE**:\n   - The query includes an `ORDER BY` clause followed by a `LIMIT 1`. If the input to the sort operation is already sorted by `o_year`, the `SORT_REMOVE` rule can be applied to eliminate the unnecessary sort operation.\n\n### Applying the Selected Rules:\n\n1. **AGGREGATE_CASE_TO_FILTER**:\n   - Transform the `SUM(CASE WHEN nation = \'SAUDI ARABIA\' THEN volume ELSE 0 END)` into `SUM(volume) FILTER (WHERE nation = \'SAUDI ARABIA\')`.\n\n2. **FILTER_INTO_JOIN**:\n   - Push the filter conditions such as `r_name = \'MIDDLE EAST\'` and `p_type = \'STANDARD BRUSHED STEEL\'` into the join conditions.\n\n3. **JOIN_CONDITION_PUSH**:\n   - Push predicates like `o_orderdate BETWEEN DATE \'1995-01-01\' AND DATE \'1996-12-31\'` into the join conditions to filter data early.\n\n4. **PROJECT_JOIN_TRANSPOSE**:\n   - Push the projection of `o_year`, `volume`, and `nation` past the join operations to reduce the data processed by the joins.\n\n5. **SORT_REMOVE**:\n   - If the data is already sorted by `o_year`, remove the sort operation.\n\nBy applying these rules, the query can be transformed into a more efficient version with reduced complexity and improved performance.\n\n```python\n[\n    "AGGREGATE_CASE_TO_FILTER",\n    "FILTER_INTO_JOIN",\n    "JOIN_CONDITION_PUSH",\n    "PROJECT_JOIN_TRANSPOSE",\n    "SORT_REMOVE"\n]\n```', 'time': 7.512012243270874}
