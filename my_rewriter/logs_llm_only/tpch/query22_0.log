inefficiencies. The query involves a subquery with a filter condition, an aggregate function, and a `NOT EXISTS` clause. The main query aggregates the results of the subquery and orders them.\n\nLet\'s break down the query and see if any rewrite rules can be applied:\n\n1. **Subquery Analysis**:\n   - The subquery filters `customer` records based on `c_acctbal` and `c_phone`.\n   - It uses a `NOT EXISTS` clause to exclude customers with orders.\n   - It calculates the average `c_acctbal` for a subset of customers.\n\n2. **Main Query Analysis**:\n   - The main query aggregates the results of the subquery by `cntrycode`.\n   - It orders the results by `cntrycode` and limits the output to 1 row.\n\n### Potential Rewrite Rules:\n\n- **FILTER_AGGREGATE_TRANSPOSE**: This rule can push the filter conditions past the aggregate functions, potentially reducing the number of rows processed by the aggregate.\n- **FILTER_INTO_JOIN**: This rule can push filter expressions into join conditions, which might help in optimizing the `NOT EXISTS` clause.\n- **AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE**: This rule can optimize the aggregation by merging it with the project operation if applicable.\n- **FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS**: This rule can simplify filter expressions, which might help in optimizing the subquery conditions.\n\n### Applying Rewrite Rules:\n\n1. **FILTER_AGGREGATE_TRANSPOSE**:\n   - This rule can be applied to push the filter conditions (`c_acctbal > avg(c_acctbal)`) past the aggregate function in the subquery. However, since the filter is already applied before aggregation, this rule might not be directly applicable.\n\n2. **FILTER_INTO_JOIN**:\n   - The `NOT EXISTS` clause can be optimized by converting it into a join condition. This can potentially reduce the complexity of the subquery.\n\n3. **AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE**:\n   - The main query aggregates the results of the subquery. If the subquery can be simplified, this rule can help in merging the aggregation with the projection.\n\n4. **FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS**:\n   - Simplifying the filter conditions in the subquery can help in reducing the complexity of the query.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe most promising rule to apply is **FILTER_INTO_JOIN**, which can optimize the `NOT EXISTS` clause by converting it into a join. The other rules might not provide significant optimization given the current structure of the query.\n\nLet\'s apply the **FILTER_INTO_JOIN** rule:\n\n```sql\nselect\n\tcntrycode,\n\tcount(*) as numcust,\n\tsum(c_acctbal) as totacctbal\nfrom\n\t(\n\t\tselect\n\t\t\tsubstring(c_phone from 1 for 2) as cntrycode,\n\t\t\tc_acctbal\n\t\tfrom\n\t\t\tcustomer c\n\t\tleft join\n\t\t\torders o on c.c_custkey = o.o_custkey\n\t\twhere\n\t\t\tsubstring(c_phone from 1 for 2) in\n\t\t\t\t(\'14\', \'29\', \'27\', \'23\', \'32\', \'10\', \'12\')\n\t\t\tand c_acctbal > (\n\t\t\t\tselect\n\t\t\t\t\tavg(c_acctbal)\n\t\t\t\tfrom\n\t\t\t\t\tcustomer\n\t\t\t\twhere\n\t\t\t\t\tc_acctbal > 0.00\n\t\t\t\t\tand substring(c_phone from 1 for 2) in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t(\'14\', \'29\', \'27\', \'23\', \'32\', \'10\', \'12\')\n\t\t\t)\n\t\t\tand o.o_custkey is null\n\t) as custsale\ngroup by\n\tcntrycode\norder by\n\tcntrycode\nlimit 1;\n```\n\nThis transformation replaces the `NOT EXISTS` clause with a `LEFT JOIN` and a `NULL` check, which can be more efficient in certain database systems.\n\n### Selected Rewrite Rules:\n\n```python\n["FILTER_INTO_JOIN"]\n```', 'time': 8.621828079223633}
