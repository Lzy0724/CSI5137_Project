The query involves a subquery that calculates the profit for each nation and year, and then aggregates these results. The query also includes multiple joins and a filter condition on the `p_name` column.\n\nLet's break down the query and consider the applicable rewrite rules:\n\n1. **Subquery with Joins and Filter**: The subquery involves multiple joins and a filter condition (`p_name like '%cyan%'`). We should consider rules that optimize join conditions and filter placement.\n\n2. **Aggregation and Grouping**: The outer query performs aggregation and grouping. We should consider rules that optimize aggregation operations.\n\n3. **Ordering and Limiting**: The query orders the results and limits the output to one row. We should consider rules that optimize sorting and limit operations.\n\n### Applicable Rules:\n\n- **FILTER_INTO_JOIN**: This rule can push filter expressions into join conditions, which can reduce the amount of data processed by the joins.\n\n- **JOIN_CONDITION_PUSH**: This rule pushes predicates in a join into the inputs to the join, which can help in reducing the data size early in the execution plan.\n\n- **AGGREGATE_FILTER_TRANSPOSE**: This rule can push the aggregate below the filter, which might help in reducing the data size before aggregation.\n\n- **SORT_REMOVE**: If the input to the sort operation is already sorted, this rule can remove the unnecessary sort operation.\n\n### Optimization Steps:\n\n1. **Apply FILTER_INTO_JOIN**: Push the filter condition `p_name like '%cyan%'` into the join condition to reduce the data size before performing the joins.\n\n2. **Apply JOIN_CONDITION_PUSH**: Push any remaining predicates in the join conditions into the inputs to further reduce the data size early.\n\n3. **Apply AGGREGATE_FILTER_TRANSPOSE**: If applicable, transpose the aggregate and filter to reduce the data size before aggregation.\n\n4. **Apply SORT_REMOVE**: Check if the input to the sort operation is already sorted and remove the sort if unnecessary.\n\nLet's apply these rules step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Apply FILTER_INTO_JOIN\n\nPush the filter condition `p_name like '%cyan%'` into the join condition:\n\n```sql\nselect\n\tnation,\n\to_year,\n\tsum(amount) as sum_profit\nfrom\n\t(\n\t\tselect\n\t\t\tn_name as nation,\n\t\t\textract(year from o_orderdate) as o_year,\n\t\t\tl_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount) - ps_supplycost * l_quantity as amount\n\t\tfrom\n\t\t\tpart,\n\t\t\tsupplier,\n\t\t\tlineitem,\n\t\t\tpartsupp,\n\t\t\torders,\n\t\t\tnation\n\t\twhere\n\t\t\ts_suppkey = l_suppkey\n\t\t\tand ps_suppkey = l_suppkey\n\t\t\tand ps_partkey = l_partkey\n\t\t\tand p_partkey = l_partkey\n\t\t\tand o_orderkey = l_orderkey\n\t\t\tand s_nationkey = n_nationkey\n\t\t\tand p_name like '%cyan%'\n\t) as profit\ngroup by\n\tnation,\n\to_year\norder by\n\tnation,\n\to_year desc\nlimit 1;\n```\n\nThe filter condition is already applied in the subquery, so no change is needed here.\n\n### Step 2: Apply JOIN_CONDITION_PUSH\n\nPush predicates in the join conditions into the inputs:\n\n```sql\nselect\n\tnation,\n\to_year,\n\tsum(amount) as sum_profit\nfrom\n\t(\n\t\tselect\n\t\t\tn_name as nation,\n\t\t\textract(year from o_orderdate) as o_year,\n\t\t\tl_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount) - ps_supplycost * l_quantity as amount\n\t\tfrom\n\t\t\tpart\n\t\t\tjoin partsupp on p_partkey = ps_partkey\n\t\t\tjoin lineitem on ps_suppkey = l_suppkey and ps_partkey = l_partkey\n\t\t\tjoin supplier on s_suppkey = l_suppkey\n\t\t\tjoin orders on o_orderkey = l_orderkey\n\t\t\tjoin nation on s_nationkey = n_nationkey\n\t\twhere\n\t\t\tp_name like '%cyan%'\n\t) as profit\ngroup by\n\tnation,\n\to_year\norder by\n\tnation,\n\to_year desc\nlimit 1;\n```\n\nThe join conditions are already optimized, so no further changes are needed.\n\n### Step 3: Apply AGGREGATE_FILTER_TRANSPOSE\n\nTranspose the aggregate and filter if applicable:\n\nIn this case, the filter is already applied before aggregation, so no change is needed.\n\n### Step 4: Apply SORT_REMOVE\n\nCheck if the input to the sort operation is already sorted:\n\nThe query orders by `nation` and `o_year desc`. Since the aggregation is grouped by these columns, the input is not guaranteed to be sorted, so the sort cannot be removed.\n\n### Final Optimized Query:\n\nThe query is already optimized with the given rules. The main optimization was ensuring that the filter condition is applied as early as possible in the join conditions.\n\n```python\n[]\n```\n\nThe query is already optimized, and no further rewrite rules are needed.", 'time': 12.491966247558594}
