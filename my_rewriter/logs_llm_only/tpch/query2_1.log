The subquery is used to find the minimum `ps_supplycost` for parts supplied by suppliers in the 'ASIA' region. This subquery can be optimized by using a join instead of a subquery, which can potentially reduce the execution time by allowing the database to use more efficient join algorithms and indexes.\n\nLet's go through the optimization process step by step:\n\n1. **Subquery to Join Transformation**: The subquery can be transformed into a join. This is a common optimization technique where a subquery is replaced by a join to improve performance. In this case, we can join the `partsupp` table with a derived table that contains the minimum `ps_supplycost` for each `p_partkey` and `s_suppkey` in the 'ASIA' region.\n\n2. **Filter Pushdown**: We can push the filter conditions as close to the base tables as possible. This means applying the filter `p_size = 45` and `p_type like '%STEEL'` directly on the `part` table, and `r_name = 'ASIA'` on the `region` table.\n\n3. **Join Condition Optimization**: Ensure that join conditions are using indexed columns and are written in a way that allows the database to use hash joins or merge joins, which are generally more efficient than nested loop joins.\n\nLet's apply these optimizations:\n\n### Step 1: Transform Subquery to Join\n\nThe original subquery:\n```sql\nand ps_supplycost = (\n    select\n        min(ps_supplycost)\n    from\n        partsupp,\n        supplier,\n        nation,\n        region\n    where\n        p_partkey = ps_partkey\n        and s_suppkey = ps_suppkey\n        and s_nationkey = n_nationkey\n        and n_regionkey = r_regionkey\n        and r_name = 'ASIA'\n)\n```\n\nCan be transformed into:\n```sql\njoin (\n    select\n        ps_partkey,\n        ps_suppkey,\n        min(ps_supplycost) as min_supplycost\n    from\n        partsupp\n        join supplier on partsupp.ps_suppkey = supplier.s_suppkey\n        join nation on supplier.s_nationkey = nation.n_nationkey\n        join region on nation.n_regionkey = region.r_regionkey\n    where\n        region.r_name = 'ASIA'\n    group by\n        ps_partkey,\n        ps_suppkey\n) as min_cost on partsupp.ps_partkey = min_cost.ps_partkey\n    and partsupp.ps_suppkey = min_cost.ps_suppkey\n    and partsupp.ps_supplycost = min_cost.min_supplycost\n```\n\n### Step 2: Apply Filter Pushdown\n\nPush the filters `p_size = 45` and `p_type like '%STEEL'` directly to the `part` table, and `r_name = 'ASIA'` to the `region` table.\n\n### Step 3: Optimize Join Conditions\n\nEnsure that all join conditions are using indexed columns, which is already the case in the provided query.\n\nAfter applying these optimizations, the optimized query becomes:\n\n```sql\nselect\n    s_acctbal,\n    s_name,\n    n_name,\n    p_partkey,\n    p_mfgr,\n    s_address,\n    s_phone,\n    s_comment\nfrom\n    part\n    join partsupp on part.p_partkey = partsupp.ps_partkey\n    join supplier on partsupp.ps_suppkey = supplier.s_suppkey\n    join nation on supplier.s_nationkey = nation.n_nationkey\n    join region on nation.n_regionkey = region.r_regionkey\n    join (\n        select\n            ps_partkey,\n            ps_suppkey,\n            min(ps_supplycost) as min_supplycost\n        from\n            partsupp\n            join supplier on partsupp.ps_suppkey = supplier.s_suppkey\n            join nation on supplier.s_nationkey = nation.n_nationkey\n            join region on nation.n_regionkey = region.r_regionkey\n        where\n            region.r_name = 'ASIA'\n        group by\n            ps_partkey,\n            ps_suppkey\n    ) as min_cost on partsupp.ps_partkey = min_cost.ps_partkey\n        and partsupp.ps_suppkey = min_cost.ps_suppkey\n        and partsupp.ps_supplycost = min_cost.min_supplycost\nwhere\n    part.p_size = 45\n    and part.p_type like '%STEEL'\n    and region.r_name = 'ASIA'\norder by\n    s_acctbal desc,\n    n_name,\n    s_name,\n    p_partkey\nlimit 100;\n```\n\nThe selected query rewrite rules are:\n\n```python\n[]\n```\n\nIn this case, the optimization was achieved through manual transformation of the subquery into a join, and filter pushdown, which are not directly covered by the provided rewrite rules. Therefore, no specific rewrite rules were applied from the list.", 'time': 9.401167154312134}
