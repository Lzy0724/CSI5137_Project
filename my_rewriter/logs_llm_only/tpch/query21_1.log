inefficiencies. The query involves multiple joins, subqueries, and a group by operation. Let\'s go through the query and see which rewrite rules can be applied to improve its performance.\n\n1. **Subquery Optimization**: The query contains two subqueries within the `EXISTS` and `NOT EXISTS` clauses. These subqueries can potentially be optimized by transforming them into joins or using other techniques to reduce their computational cost.\n\n2. **Join Optimization**: The query involves multiple joins between `supplier`, `lineitem`, `orders`, and `nation`. We should consider rules that can push filters into joins or optimize join conditions.\n\n3. **Filter Optimization**: There are several filter conditions in the `WHERE` clause. We should look for opportunities to push these filters down to reduce the number of rows processed in subsequent operations.\n\n4. **Aggregate Optimization**: The query uses an aggregate function `COUNT(*)`. We should check if there are any rules that can optimize this aggregation.\n\nBased on the above analysis, let\'s select the most appropriate rules:\n\n### Selected Rules:\n\n1. **FILTER_INTO_JOIN**: This rule tries to push filter expressions into a join condition and into the inputs of the join. This can help reduce the number of rows processed by the join operation.\n\n2. **JOIN_CONDITION_PUSH**: This rule pushes predicates in a join into the inputs to the join. This can further optimize the join operation by reducing the number of rows early in the execution plan.\n\n3. **FILTER_AGGREGATE_TRANSPOSE**: This rule pushes a filter past an aggregate. This can help in reducing the number of rows that need to be aggregated, thus optimizing the aggregation process.\n\nLet\'s apply these rules step by step:\n\n### Step-by-Step Transformation:\n\n1. **Apply FILTER_INTO_JOIN**: Push filter conditions into the join conditions. This involves moving the `o_orderstatus = \'F\'`, `l1.l_receiptdate > l1.l_commitdate`, and `n_name = \'UNITED KINGDOM\'` conditions into the respective join conditions.\n\n2. **Apply JOIN_CONDITION_PUSH**: Further push any remaining predicates into the join inputs. This ensures that the joins are as selective as possible.\n\n3. **Apply FILTER_AGGREGATE_TRANSPOSE**: Push the filter conditions past the aggregate operation. This reduces the number of rows that need to be aggregated.\n\nBy applying these rules, we can optimize the query to reduce the number of rows processed at each stage, leading to improved performance.\n\n### Optimized Query:\n\n```sql\nselect\n    s_name,\n    count(*) as numwait\nfrom\n    supplier\n    join lineitem l1 on s_suppkey = l1.l_suppkey and l1.l_receiptdate > l1.l_commitdate\n    join orders on o_orderkey = l1.l_orderkey and o_orderstatus = \'F\'\n    join nation on s_nationkey = n_nationkey and n_name = \'UNITED KINGDOM\'\nwhere\n    exists (\n        select\n            *\n        from\n            lineitem l2\n        where\n            l2.l_orderkey = l1.l_orderkey\n            and l2.l_suppkey <> l1.l_suppkey\n    )\n    and not exists (\n        select\n            *\n        from\n            lineitem l3\n        where\n            l3.l_orderkey = l1.l_orderkey\n            and l3.l_suppkey <> l1.l_suppkey\n            and l3.l_receiptdate > l3.l_commitdate\n    )\ngroup by\n    s_name\norder by\n    numwait desc,\n    s_name\nlimit 100;\n```\n\n### Selected Rules List:\n\n```python\n[\n    "FILTER_INTO_JOIN",\n    "JOIN_CONDITION_PUSH",\n    "FILTER_AGGREGATE_TRANSPOSE"\n]\n```', 'time': 8.202080965042114}
