The query involves multiple joins, a subquery, and a group by operation. Let\'s go through the potential optimizations:\n\n1. **Filter Pushdown**: We can push filters closer to the data source to reduce the amount of data processed in joins and aggregations. The `FILTER_INTO_JOIN` rule can be applied to push filter conditions into the join conditions.\n\n2. **Join Condition Push**: The `JOIN_CONDITION_PUSH` rule can be used to push predicates in a join into the inputs to the join, which can help in reducing the data size early in the query execution.\n\n3. **Project Filter Transpose**: The `PROJECT_FILTER_TRANSPOSE` rule can be used to push projections past filters, which can help in reducing the number of columns processed in subsequent operations.\n\n4. **Aggregate Filter Transpose**: The `AGGREGATE_FILTER_TRANSPOSE` rule can be used to push aggregates below filters, which can help in reducing the data size before aggregation.\n\n5. **Sort Remove**: Since the query has an `ORDER BY` clause followed by a `LIMIT 1`, the `SORT_REMOVE` rule can be applied if the input is already sorted or if sorting is not necessary due to the limit.\n\nLet\'s apply these rules step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Apply `FILTER_INTO_JOIN`\n- Push the filter conditions `l_shipdate between date \'1995-01-01\' and date \'1996-12-31\'` and `(n1.n_name = \'FRANCE\' and n2.n_name = \'SAUDI ARABIA\') or (n1.n_name = \'SAUDI ARABIA\' and n2.n_name = \'FRANCE\')` into the join conditions.\n\n### Step 2: Apply `JOIN_CONDITION_PUSH`\n- Push join predicates into the inputs of the join to reduce the data size early.\n\n### Step 3: Apply `PROJECT_FILTER_TRANSPOSE`\n- Push projections past filters to reduce the number of columns processed in subsequent operations.\n\n### Step 4: Apply `AGGREGATE_FILTER_TRANSPOSE`\n- Push aggregates below filters to reduce the data size before aggregation.\n\n### Step 5: Apply `SORT_REMOVE`\n- Remove the sort operation if the input is already sorted or if sorting is not necessary due to the limit.\n\nAfter applying these rules, the query will be more efficient by reducing the data size early in the execution and minimizing unnecessary operations.\n\n```python\n[\n    "FILTER_INTO_JOIN",\n    "JOIN_CONDITION_PUSH",\n    "PROJECT_FILTER_TRANSPOSE",\n    "AGGREGATE_FILTER_TRANSPOSE",\n    "SORT_REMOVE"\n]\n```', 'time': 7.547950983047485}
