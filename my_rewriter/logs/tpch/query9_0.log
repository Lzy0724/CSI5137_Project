When the `LIMIT` clause is used to fetch a specified number of rows.\n2. When `ORDER BY` is used in conjunction with `LIMIT` to sort and limit the number of rows retrieved, particularly when sorting can leverage an index.\n3. When `DISTINCT` is used along with `LIMIT` to quickly identify and return unique rows without scanning the full dataset.\n4. During the use of `GROUP BY`, where optimization might involve sorting or traversing indexes in order to efficiently compute group values without processing the entire dataset.\n5. When sorting a specific number of rows from a single table based on non-indexed columns, utilizing in-memory sorting (`filesort`) techniques.\n**Transformations**: The specific SQL transformations that emerge from applying these optimization rules are:\n1. Combining `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY` encourages the database engine to stop the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained, avoiding full table sorts.\n2. Using `LIMIT` with `DISTINCT` leads to an early termination of the search for unique rows as soon as the needed amount is gathered, reducing time and resources spent on scanning the entire dataset.\n3. In the context of `GROUP BY`, optimizations may include indexing strategies or modifications to the way sorting is handled, such as employing `filesort` mechanisms that do not require temporary tables, ensuring that the database engine processes only the necessary data for group computations.\n4. Efficiencies are gained by encouraging the use of indexed columns with `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT`, making queries more efficient by reducing the cost associated with sorting and filtering operations.\n"""\nRule 2:\n"""\n**Conditions**: The SQL query rewrite rule applies when there are:\n- Functions or operations (especially deterministic ones) within the SELECT, WHERE, JOIN conditions, or any part of the query that is executed multiple times for the same row.\n- The presence of potentially computationally expensive operations or function calls that are not dependent on the data of the specific row and thus can be optimized.\n**Transformations**: 1. Move repeated function calls or operations outside of loops, if applicable. For example, if a function that generates a calculated value based on constants or parameters (not row-specific data) is being called in a loop, calculate the value once before the loop and store the result for reuse.\n   \n2. Replace inline functions in the SELECT or WHERE clause with a pre-calculated column if the function is deterministic and the input data does not change frequently. This might involve:\n   - Creating a temporary table that includes the results of the expensive function calls.\n   - Using a subquery or a Common Table Expression (CTE) that calculates the value once and then joins it with the main query.\n   \n3. When using aggregate functions that are called multiple times with the same parameters, consider storing the result in a variable or a temporary table, especially if the data set is large.\n\n4. Avoid using functions on indexed columns in the WHERE clause. This prevents the database from using the index efficiently. If a function must be used, consider creating a computed column that pre-calculates the function\'s result and index that column instead.\n\n5. If possible, simplify expressions and calculations to reduce their complexity and execution time. This might involve algebraic simplification or breaking down complex calculations into simpler parts that can be calculated separately and then combined.\n\nExample:\nOriginal Query:\n```sql\nSELECT id, name, expensive_function(column) as expensive_result\nFROM table\nWHERE expensive_function(column) > 100;\n```\n\nTransformed Query using a CTE:\n```sql\nWITH PreCalculated AS (\n  SELECT id, name, column, expensive_function(column) as expensive_result\n  FROM table\n)\nSELECT id, name, expensive_sel as expensive_result\nFROM PreCalculated\nWHERE expensive_result > 100;\n```\n"""'}], 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'stream': False, 'temperature': 0.1}}

The filter's expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there's a matching row in the non-preserving side's table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned.\n```\n\nLogical Plan Changes After Rewrite: ```\n  LogicalSort(sort0=[$0(n_name)], sort1=[$1(o_orderdate)], dir0=[ASC], dir1=[DESC], fetch=[1])\r\n    LogicalAggregate(group=[{0, 1}], sum_profit=[SUM($2)])\r\n      LogicalProject(nation=[$47(n_name)], o_year=[EXTRACT(FLAG(YEAR), $41(o_orderdate))], amount=[-(*($21(l_extendedprice), -(1, $22(l_discount))), *($35(ps_supplycost), $20(l_quantity)))])\r\n-       LogicalFilter(condition=[AND(=($9(s_suppkey), $18(l_suppkey)), =($33(ps_suppkey), $18(l_suppkey)), =($32(ps_partkey), $17(l_partkey)), =($0(p_partkey), $17(l_partkey)), =($37(o_orderkey), $16(l_orderkey)), =($12(s_nationkey), $46(n_nationkey)), LIKE($1(p_name), '%cyan%'))])\r\n+       LogicalJoin(condition=[=($12(s_nationkey), $46(n_nationkey))], joinType=[inner])\r\n-         LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n?                                ^ ^\n\n+         LogicalJoin(condition=[=($37(o_orderkey), $16(l_orderkey))], joinType=[inner])\r\n?                                ^^^^^^^^^ ^ +++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n-           LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n-             LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n+           LogicalJoin(condition=[AND(=($33(ps_suppkey), $18(l_suppkey)), =($32(ps_partkey), $17(l_partkey)))], joinType=[inner])\r\n+             LogicalJoin(condition=[AND(=($9(s_suppkey), $18(l_suppkey)), =($0(p_partkey), $17(l_partkey)))], joinType=[inner])\r\n                LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n-                 LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n+                 LogicalFilter(condition=[LIKE($1(p_name), '%cyan%')])\r\n                    LogicalTableScan(table=[[part]])\r\n-                   LogicalTableScan(table=[[supplier]])\r\n? --\n\n+                 LogicalTableScan(table=[[supplier]])\r\n-                 LogicalTableScan(table=[[lineitem]])\r\n? --\n\n+               LogicalTableScan(table=[[lineitem]])\r\n-               LogicalTableScan(table=[[partsupp]])\r\n? --\n\n+             LogicalTableScan(table=[[partsupp]])\r\n-             LogicalTableScan(table=[[orders]])\r\n? --\n\n+           LogicalTableScan(table=[[orders]])\r\n-           LogicalTableScan(table=[[nation]])\r\n? --\n\n+         LogicalTableScan(table=[[nation]])\r\n  \n```"}], 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'stream': False, 'temperature': 0.1}}

For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned.\n```\n\nLogical Plan Changes After Rewrite: ```\n  LogicalSort(sort0=[$0(n_name)], sort1=[$1(o_orderdate)], dir0=[ASC], dir1=[DESC], fetch=[1])\r\n    LogicalAggregate(group=[{0, 1}], sum_profit=[SUM($2)])\r\n      LogicalProject(nation=[$47(n_name)], o_year=[EXTRACT(FLAG(YEAR), $41(o_orderdate))], amount=[-(*($21(l_extendedprice), -(1, $22(l_discount))), *($35(ps_supplycost), $20(l_quantity)))])\r\n-       LogicalFilter(condition=[AND(=($9(s_suppkey), $18(l_suppkey)), =($33(ps_suppkey), $18(l_suppkey)), =($32(ps_partkey), $17(l_partkey)), =($0(p_partkey), $17(l_partkey)), =($37(o_orderkey), $16(l_orderkey)), =($12(s_nationkey), $46(n_nationkey)), LIKE($1(p_name), '%cyan%'))])\r\n+       LogicalJoin(condition=[=($12(s_nationkey), $46(n_nationkey))], joinType=[inner])\r\n-         LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n?                                ^ ^\n\n+         LogicalJoin(condition=[=($37(o_orderkey), $16(l_orderkey))], joinType=[inner])\r\n?                                ^^^^^^^^^ ^ +++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n-           LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n-             LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n+           LogicalJoin(condition=[AND(=($33(ps_suppkey), $18(l_suppkey)), =($32(ps_partkey), $17(l_partkey)))], joinType=[inner])\r\n+             LogicalJoin(condition=[AND(=($9(s_suppkey), $18(l_suppkey)), =($0(p_partkey), $17(l_partkey)))], joinType=[inner])\r\n                LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n-                 LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n+                 LogicalFilter(condition=[LIKE($1(p_name), '%cyan%')])\r\n                    LogicalTableScan(table=[[part]])\r\n-                   LogicalTableScan(table=[[supplier]])\r\n? --\n\n+                 LogicalTableScan(table=[[supplier]])\r\n-                 LogicalTableScan(table=[[lineitem]])\r\n? --\n\n+               LogicalTableScan(table=[[lineitem]])\r\n-               LogicalTableScan(table=[[partsupp]])\r\n? --\n\n+             LogicalTableScan(table=[[partsupp]])\r\n-             LogicalTableScan(table=[[orders]])\r\n? --\n\n+           LogicalTableScan(table=[[orders]])\r\n-           LogicalTableScan(table=[[nation]])\r\n? --\n\n+         LogicalTableScan(table=[[nation]])\r\n  \n```"}], 'response': "Step 1: The logical plan changes indicate that several filter conditions initially applied in a `LogicalFilter` node have been moved into `LogicalJoin` conditions. Specifically, the conditions `=($9(s_suppkey), $18(l_suppkey))`, `=($33(ps_suppkey), $18(l_suppkey))`, `=($32(ps_partkey), $17(l_partkey))`, `=($0(p_partkey), $17(l_partkey))`, `=($37(o_orderkey), $16(l_orderkey))`, and `=($12(s_nationkey), $46(n_nationkey))` have been moved from a `LogicalFilter` to `LogicalJoin` conditions. Additionally, the `LIKE($1(p_name), '%cyan%')` condition has been moved to a `LogicalFilter` directly on the `part` table.\n\nStep 2: Parsing these changes into SQL query terms, the conditions involving equality checks between columns of different tables (e.g., `s_suppkey = l_suppkey`, `ps_suppkey = l_suppkey`, etc.) have been moved from the `WHERE` clause to the `ON` clause of the respective `INNER JOIN` operations. The `LIKE` condition on `p_name` remains as a filter on the `part` table before it participates in any join operations.\n\nStep 3: The query rewrite rule contains multiple cases. The changes observed match Case 1 of the query rewrite rule. This case applies when a filter condition is placed on the result set of an `INNER JOIN` operation, and the filter's expressions can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs. The conditions moved from the `WHERE` clause to the `ON` clause of `INNER JOIN` operations involve columns from only one side of the join, thus matching the conditions of Case 1.\n\nStep 4: In the original SQL query, the `WHERE` clause contained multiple conditions that could be logically associated with the `INNER JOIN` operations. By moving these conditions into the `ON` clause of the `INNER JOIN`, the query optimizer can potentially reduce the size of intermediate datasets before performing the join operations, leading to more efficient query execution. Specifically, conditions like `s_suppkey = l_suppkey`, `ps_suppkey = l_suppkey`, `ps_partkey = l_partkey`, `p_partkey = l_partkey`, `o_orderkey = l_orderkey`, and `s_nationkey = n_nationkey` were moved to the `ON` clause of their respective joins. The `LIKE` condition on `p_name` was applied directly to the `part` table before joining, ensuring that only relevant rows are considered in subsequent operations.

By moving these conditions into the `ON` clause of the `INNER JOIN`, the query optimizer can potentially reduce the size of intermediate datasets before performing the join operations, leading to more efficient query execution. Specifically, conditions like `s_suppkey = l_suppkey`, `ps_suppkey = l_suppkey`, `ps_partkey = l_partkey`, `p_partkey = l_partkey`, `o_orderkey = l_orderkey`, and `s_nationkey = n_nationkey` were moved to the `ON` clause of their respective joins. The `LIKE` condition on `p_name` was applied directly to the `part` table before joining, ensuring that only relevant rows are considered in subsequent operations. This transformation aligns with the optimization strategy outlined in Case 1 of the query rewrite rule."""\n\nQuery Rewrite 2:\n"""The SQL query matches Rule 1 due to the use of `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY` and `GROUP BY`. The transformation involves leveraging the `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY` to encourage the database engine to stop sorting as soon as the required number of rows is obtained. This avoids a full table sort, especially since the query limits the result to a single row (`LIMIT 1`). The database engine can optimize the sorting process by using an index if available or employing in-memory sorting techniques (`filesort`) to efficiently handle the `ORDER BY` operation. Additionally, the `GROUP BY` operation can be optimized by ensuring that only necessary data is processed for group computations, potentially using indexing strategies or efficient sorting mechanisms."""\n\nQuery Rewrite 3:\n"""The SQL query matches Rule 2 due to the presence of deterministic functions and operations within the subquery. Specifically, the `EXTRACT(year from o_orderdate)` function and the calculation of `amount` could be optimized. The transformation involves pre-calculating these values if they are used multiple times for the same row. For instance, a Common Table Expression (CTE) or a subquery could be used to calculate `o_year` and `amount` once, storing these results for reuse in the main query. This reduces the computational overhead by avoiding repeated calculations for each row processed. Additionally, if the `EXTRACT` function is applied to an indexed column, creating a computed column with the extracted year and indexing it could further enhance performance."""'}], 'response': 'The provided SQL query can be optimized using several strategies.

This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there's a matching row in the non-preserving side's table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side.

Firstly, by moving conditions from the `WHERE` clause to the `ON` clause of `INNER JOIN` operations, the query optimizer can reduce the size of intermediate datasets, enhancing efficiency. This involves associating conditions like `s_suppkey = l_suppkey` and others directly with their respective joins, while applying the `LIKE` condition on `p_name` before joining to filter relevant rows early. Secondly, the use of `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY` and `GROUP BY` can be optimized by allowing the database engine to stop sorting once the required number of rows is obtained, potentially using indexing or in-memory sorting techniques to handle the `ORDER BY` operation efficiently. Lastly, the query can benefit from pre-calculating deterministic functions and operations within the subquery, such as `EXTRACT(year from o_orderdate)` and the `amount` calculation, using a Common Table Expression (CTE) or subquery to store and reuse these results, thereby reducing computational overhead. Additionally, creating a computed column with the extracted year and indexing it could further enhance performance if the `EXTRACT` function is applied to an indexed column."""\n\nQuery Rewrite Rules:\n### Rule FILTER_INTO_JOIN:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: This SQL query rewrite rule applies when a filter condition is placed on the result set of an INNER JOIN operation. The filter\'s expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there\'s a matching row in the non-preserving side\'s table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned."""\n\n### Rule JOIN_TO_CORRELATE:\n"""**Conditions**: The join type is either INNER JOIN or LEFT JOIN. There are no requirements in the query that would inherently create NULL values on the left side when there are no matching rows on the right side (for INNER JOIN, this condition is naturally met; for LEFT JOIN, it is met if every row on the left side has at least one corresponding row on the right side according to the join condition).\n**Transformations**: 1. Identify the INNER JOIN or LEFT JOIN condition in the SQL query. 2. Extract the ON clause representing the join condition. 3. For INNER JOIN: - Replace the INNER JOIN with a WHERE EXISTS clause, moving the original join condition into the WHERE clause of a subquery that selects from the right side table.

Firstly, by moving conditions from the `WHERE` clause to the `ON` clause of `INNER JOIN` operations, the query optimizer can reduce the size of intermediate datasets, enhancing efficiency. This involves associating conditions like `s_suppkey = l_suppkey` and others directly with their respective joins, while applying the `LIKE` condition on `p_name` before joining to filter relevant rows early. Secondly, the use of `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY` and `GROUP BY` can be optimized by allowing the database engine to stop sorting once the required number of rows is obtained, potentially using indexing or in-memory sorting techniques to handle the `ORDER BY` operation efficiently. Lastly, the query can benefit from pre-calculating deterministic functions and operations within the subquery, such as `EXTRACT(year from o_orderdate)` and the `amount` calculation, using a Common Table Expression (CTE) or subquery to store and reuse these results, thereby reducing computational overhead. Additionally, creating a computed column with the extracted year and indexing it could further enhance performance if the `EXTRACT` function is applied to an indexed column."""\n\nQuery Rewrite Rules:\n### Rule FILTER_INTO_JOIN:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: This SQL query rewrite rule applies when a filter condition is placed on the result set of an INNER JOIN operation. The filter\'s expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there\'s a matching row in the non-preserving side\'s table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned."""\n\n### Rule JOIN_TO_CORRELATE:\n"""**Conditions**: The join type is either INNER JOIN or LEFT JOIN. There are no requirements in the query that would inherently create NULL values on the left side when there are no matching rows on the right side (for INNER JOIN, this condition is naturally met; for LEFT JOIN, it is met if every row on the left side has at least one corresponding row on the right side according to the join condition).\n**Transformations**: 1. Identify the INNER JOIN or LEFT JOIN condition in the SQL query. 2. Extract the ON clause representing the join condition. 3. For INNER JOIN: - Replace the INNER JOIN with a WHERE EXISTS clause, moving the original join condition into the WHERE clause of a subquery that selects from the right side table. Reference the left side columns as correlation variables in the subquery\'s WHERE clause. - Example Transformation: SELECT * FROM left_table INNER JOIN right_table ON left_table.id = right_table.foreign_id Becomes: SELECT * FROM left_table WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM right_table WHERE left_table.id = right_table.foreign_id) 4. For LEFT JOIN: - Replace the LEFT JOIN with a LEFT OUTER JOIN subquery that is correlated to the outer query. In the SELECT clause of the outer query, include a CASE statement or similar logic to handle selection from the subquery result. - Example Transformation: SELECT left_table.*, right_table.* FROM left_table LEFT JOIN right_table ON left_table.id = right_table.foreign_id Becomes: SELECT left_table.*, COALESCE(subquery.alias1, \'default\') FROM left_table LEFT OUTER JOIN (SELECT foreign_id, column1 AS alias1 FROM right_table) subquery ON left_table.id = subquery.foreign_id"""\n\n### Rule AGGREGATE_REDUCE_FUNCTIONS:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: any SELECT statement or subquery using the AVG aggregate function\n**Transformations**: AVG(x) as SUM(x) / COUNT(x)\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: computing the population standard deviation\n**Transformations**: STDDEV_POP(x) as the square root of (`SUM(x^2) - SUM(x)^2 / COUNT(x)`) / COUNT(x)\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: for the sample standard deviation computation\n**Transformations**: STDDEV_SAMP(x) as the square root of (`SUM(x^2) - SUM(x)^2 / COUNT(x)`) / (COUNT(x) - 1)\nCase 4:\n**Conditions**: for the population variance computation\n**Transformations**: VAR_POP(x) as (`SUM(x^2) - SUM(x)^2 / COUNT(x)`) / COUNT(x)\nCase 5:\n**Conditions**: for the sample variance computation\n**Transformations**: VAR_SAMP(x) as (`SUM(x^2) - SUM(x)^2 / COUNT(x)`) / (COUNT(x) - 1)\nCase 6:\n**Conditions**: to compute population covariance\n**Transformations**: COVAR_POP(x, y) by applying a formula involving SUM and COUNT\nCase 7:\n**Conditions**: using a formula for sample covariance\n**Transformations**: COVAR_SAMP(x, y) using a formula involving SUM, COUNT, and an adjustment for sample calculations\nCase 8:\n**Conditions**: for transforming REGR_SXX(x, y) and REGR_SYY(x, y)\n**Transformations**: into expressions involving the computation of VAR_POP(x) or VAR_POP(y) respectively, multiplied by REGR_COUNT(x, y)"""\n\n### Rule PROJECT_FILTER_TRANSPOSE:\n"""**Conditions**: This rewrite rule can be applied when an SQL query contains a SELECT operation (acting as the `Project` operation) followed by a WHERE clause (acting as the `Filter` operation), provided that the SELECT does not contain window functions (such as RANK(), ROW_NUMBER(), etc.) and the columns selected do not affect the outcome of the WHERE clause.\n**Transformations**: To apply the rule, refactor the SQL query so that the conditions in the WHERE clause are evaluated before the columns are selected in the SELECT clause. This may involve moving computations or column transformations from the SELECT clause to a sub-query that the WHERE clause is applied on, ensuring the final SELECT clause on the outermost query matches the original query\'s expected outcome. - Before: SELECT col1, transformation_function(col2) FROM table WHERE condition; - After: SELECT col1, transformation_function(col2) FROM (SELECT col1, col2 FROM table WHERE condition) AS subquery;"""'}], 'response': 'Step 1: Evaluate each suggestion against the provided rules.\n\n### Suggestion 1:\n1. **Moving conditions from the `WHERE` clause to the `ON` clause of `INNER JOIN` operations**:\n   - **Rule FILTER_INTO_JOIN**: This rule directly applies as it involves moving filter conditions from the `WHERE` clause to the `ON` clause of an `INNER JOIN`.

Firstly, by moving conditions from the `WHERE` clause to the `ON` clause of `INNER JOIN` operations, the query optimizer can reduce the size of intermediate datasets, enhancing efficiency. This involves associating conditions like `s_suppkey = l_suppkey` and others directly with their respective joins, while applying the `LIKE` condition on `p_name` before joining to filter relevant rows early. Secondly, the use of `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY` and `GROUP BY` can be optimized by allowing the database engine to stop sorting once the required number of rows is obtained, potentially using indexing or in-memory sorting techniques to handle the `ORDER BY` operation efficiently. Lastly, the query can benefit from pre-calculating deterministic functions and operations within the subquery, such as `EXTRACT(year from o_orderdate)` and the `amount` calculation, using a Common Table Expression (CTE) or subquery to store and reuse these results, thereby reducing computational overhead. Additionally, creating a computed column with the extracted year and indexing it could further enhance performance if the `EXTRACT` function is applied to an indexed column."""\n\nQuery Rewrite Rule Sets:\n### FILTER Operator Rules: ["FILTER_INTO_JOIN", "PROJECT_FILTER_TRANSPOSE"]\n\n### JOIN Operator Rules: ["FILTER_INTO_JOIN"]\n\n### PROJECT Operator Rules: ["PROJECT_FILTER_TRANSPOSE"]\n\nQuery Rewrite Rule Explanations:\n### Rule FILTER_INTO_JOIN:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: This SQL query rewrite rule applies when a filter condition is placed on the result set of an INNER JOIN operation. The filter\'s expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there\'s a matching row in the non-preserving side\'s table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned."""\n\n### Rule PROJECT_FILTER_TRANSPOSE:\n"""**Conditions**: This rewrite rule can be applied when an SQL query contains a SELECT operation (acting as the `Project` operation) followed by a WHERE clause (acting as the `Filter` operation), provided that the SELECT does not contain window functions (such as RANK(), ROW_NUMBER(), etc.) and the columns selected do not affect the outcome of the WHERE clause.\n**Transformations**: To apply the rule, refactor the SQL query so that the conditions in the WHERE clause are evaluated before the columns are selected in the SELECT clause.

The suggestions emphasize moving conditions from the `WHERE` clause to the `ON` clause of `INNER JOIN` operations and optimizing the use of `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY` and `GROUP BY`. The `FILTER_INTO_JOIN` rule directly addresses the first suggestion by moving filter conditions into the `ON` clause of joins. The `PROJECT_FILTER_TRANSPOSE` rule is relevant for optimizing the order of operations in the query, which can indirectly support the suggestion of pre-calculating deterministic functions and operations. \n\nFor the `FILTER` Operator Rules, both rules are relevant, but `FILTER_INTO_JOIN` is more directly aligned with the suggestion to move conditions to the `ON` clause. For the `JOIN` Operator Rules, `FILTER_INTO_JOIN` is the only rule and directly supports the suggestion.

Firstly, by moving conditions from the `WHERE` clause to the `ON` clause of `INNER JOIN` operations, the query optimizer can reduce the size of intermediate datasets, enhancing efficiency. This involves associating conditions like `s_suppkey = l_suppkey` and others directly with their respective joins, while applying the `LIKE` condition on `p_name` before joining to filter relevant rows early. Secondly, the use of `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY` and `GROUP BY` can be optimized by allowing the database engine to stop sorting once the required number of rows is obtained, potentially using indexing or in-memory sorting techniques to handle the `ORDER BY` operation efficiently. Lastly, the query can benefit from pre-calculating deterministic functions and operations within the subquery, such as `EXTRACT(year from o_orderdate)` and the `amount` calculation, using a Common Table Expression (CTE) or subquery to store and reuse these results, thereby reducing computational overhead. Additionally, creating a computed column with the extracted year and indexing it could further enhance performance if the `EXTRACT` function is applied to an indexed column."""\n\nQuery Rewrite Rules:\n### Rule FILTER_INTO_JOIN:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: This SQL query rewrite rule applies when a filter condition is placed on the result set of an INNER JOIN operation. The filter\'s expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there\'s a matching row in the non-preserving side\'s table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned."""\n\n### Rule PROJECT_FILTER_TRANSPOSE:\n"""**Conditions**: This rewrite rule can be applied when an SQL query contains a SELECT operation (acting as the `Project` operation) followed by a WHERE clause (acting as the `Filter` operation), provided that the SELECT does not contain window functions (such as RANK(), ROW_NUMBER(), etc.) and the columns selected do not affect the outcome of the WHERE clause.\n**Transformations**: To apply the rule, refactor the SQL query so that the conditions in the WHERE clause are evaluated before the columns are selected in the SELECT clause. This may involve moving computations or column transformations from the SELECT clause to a sub-query that the WHERE clause is applied on, ensuring the final SELECT clause on the outermost query matches the original query\'s expected outcome. - Before: SELECT col1, transformation_function(col2) FROM table WHERE condition; - After: SELECT col1, transformation_function(col2) FROM (SELECT col1, col2 FROM table WHERE condition) AS subquery;"""\n\nArranged Rule Sequence: ["FILTER_INTO_JOIN", "PROJECT_FILTER_TRANSPOSE"]\n\nUtilized Rules: ["FILTER_INTO_JOIN"]\n\nUnutilized Rules: ["PROJECT_FILTER_TRANSPOSE"]'}], 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'stream': False, 'temperature': 0.1}}
