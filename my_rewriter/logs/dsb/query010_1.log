Transform `(x AND y) OR z` into `(x OR z) AND (y OR z)`.\n2. Transform `(x OR y) AND z` into `(x AND z) OR (y AND z)`.\n"""\nRule 2:\n"""\n**Conditions**: The SQL query utilizes traditional filtering mechanisms such as NOT EXISTS, NOT IN, EXISTS, IN, OR within JOINs and WHERE clauses.\n**Transformations**: - Replace IN with INTERSECT for querying intersecting datasets to potentially improve index usage and query speed.\n- Rewrite conditions using the OR operator into a series of UNION ALL operations to enhance code maintainability and performance.\n- Use EXCEPT instead of NOT IN or anti-joins to minimize duplicate row processing and optimize resource use, effectively reducing execution time.\n"""\nRule 3:\n"""\n**Conditions**: - The SQL query performs a `GROUP BY` operation along with other operations like `JOIN`.\n- Query performance could be enhanced by reducing the size of intermediate datasets.\n- Suitable for queries involving large datasets or attributes from Entity-Attribute-Value (EAV) tables.\n- Applicable when reordering the sequence of operations can lead to performance improvements.\n**Transformations**: - Rearrange the query to perform `GROUP BY` operations at the earliest stage, ideally before executing operations like `JOIN`.\n- Utilize subqueries for pre-aggregation to reduce the dataset size early in the execution process.\n- Directly restructure the query to prioritize grouping operations to minimize the workload on subsequent operations like `JOIN`, thereby enhancing overall execution speed and efficiency.\n"""\nRule 4:\n"""\n**Conditions**: The SQL query optimization rules apply under the following conditions:\n1. When the `LIMIT` clause is used to fetch a specified number of rows.\n2. When `ORDER BY` is used in conjunction with `LIMIT` to sort and limit the number of rows retrieved, particularly when sorting can leverage an index.\n3. When `DISTINCT` is used along with `LIMIT` to quickly identify and return unique rows without scanning the full dataset.\n4. During the use of `GROUP BY`, where optimization might involve sorting or traversing indexes in order to efficiently compute group values without processing the entire dataset.\n5. When sorting a specific number of rows from a single table based on non-indexed columns, utilizing in-memory sorting (`filesort`) techniques.\n**Transformations**: The specific SQL transformations that emerge from applying these optimization rules are:\n1. Combining `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY` encourages the database engine to stop the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained, avoiding full table sorts.\n2. Using `LIMIT` with `DISTINCT` leads to an early termination of the search for unique rows as soon as the needed amount is gathered, reducing time and resources spent on scanning the entire dataset.\n3. In the context of `GROUP BY`, optimizations may include indexing strategies or modifications to the way sorting is handled, such as employing `filesort` mechanisms that do not require temporary tables, ensuring that the database engine processes only the necessary data for group computations.\n4. Efficiencies are gained by encouraging the use of indexed columns with `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT`, making queries more efficient by reducing the cost associated with sorting and filtering operations.\n"""\nRule 5:\n"""\n**Conditions**: The rule applies when the original SQL query performs multiple scans or joins on the same table to retrieve different attributes for certain conditions, or when the query structure results in redundant data processing and complexity that could be reduced.\n**Transformations**: - Combine multiple joins into a single join operation by using `CASE` statements to conditionally select different attributes from the table in one pass. \n- Use the `COALESCE` function in conjunction with `CASE` statements to efficiently merge conditional attributes into distinct columns based on specific criteria without the need for additional joins.\n- Optimize the selection of conditional attributes by integrating `GROUP BY` with aggregate functions like `MAX` within `CASE` statements, thus condensing the result set to only the necessary data and avoiding needless retrieval and processing steps.\n- The overall transformation leads to a single, more efficient query that accomplishes the tasks of multiple, less efficient operations, improving performance, and simplifying the query for better readability and maintenance.\n"""'}], 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'stream': False, 'temperature': 0.1}}

the inner query before the projection.\n- Eliminate the outer projection layer if it only renames the columns without transforming them.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: - The `SELECT` clause of an outer

'response': "Step 1: The logical plan changes indicate that the primary transformation involves the `LogicalAggregate` and `LogicalProject` operations. The `LogicalAggregate` operation's grouping columns have been shifted from indices `{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}` to `{32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39}`. This suggests that the aggregation is now being applied directly to the data source rather than through an intermediate projection layer. The `LogicalProject` operation, which previously renamed columns, has been removed, indicating that the outer projection layer was eliminated.\n\nStep 2: Parsing the logical plan changes, we see that the SQL query's `GROUP BY` clause and aggregate functions (`count(*)`) are directly applied to the data source. The columns involved in the `GROUP BY` clause are `cd_gender`, `cd_marital_status`, `cd_education_status`, `cd_purchase_estimate`, `cd_credit_rating`, `cd_dep_count`, `cd_dep_employed_count`, and `cd_dep_college_count`. The aggregate functions (`count(*)`) are applied without any transformations or additional expressions.\n\nStep 3: The query rewrite rule contains two cases. Case 1 applies when the `GROUP BY` clause groups by simple columns, and the aggregate functions operate directly on columns without transformations. Case 2 applies when the `SELECT` clause of an outer query matches the columns used in the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions of an inner query. In this scenario, the changes match Case 1 because the `GROUP BY` clause and aggregate functions are directly applied to the data source, and the outer projection layer is eliminated.\n\nStep 4: In Case 1, the SQL query changes involve directly applying the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions to the data source in the `FROM` clause of the inner query. The outer projection layer, which only renamed columns without transforming them, is eliminated. This is evident from the removal of the `LogicalProject` operation and the direct application of the `LogicalAggregate` operation to the data source. The SQL query's `GROUP BY` clause and aggregate functions are simplified by removing unnecessary intermediate steps, leading to a more efficient execution plan.", 'time': 4.628105163574219}

The JOIN condition uses the correlation ID (the matching column(s) in both outer and sub-query).\n  - Original Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 WHERE column = (SELECT AGG_FUNCTION(column2) FROM table2 WHERE table1.join_column = table2.join_column)\n  - Transformed Query Structure: SELECT ...

FROM table1 WHERE column IN (SELECT column2 FROM table2 WHERE table1.join_column = table2.join_column)\n    - Transformed Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.join_column = table2.join_column WHERE table2.column2 IS NOT NULL\n  - For `EXISTS` Sub-queries: Convert the `EXISTS` condition into a JOIN operation, using WHERE to filter rows that match the JOIN condition.\n    - Original Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM table2 WHERE table1.join_column = table2.join_class)\n    - Transformed Query Structure: SELECT DISTINCT table1.* FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.join_column = table2.join_column\n  - For `UNIQUE` Sub-queries: Since `UNIQUE` requires a bit more complex handling not directly mappable to a standard JOIN, it should be considered a special case where the goal is to ensure that rows from the outer query match a unique set in the sub-query. This might not translate directly into SQL syntax without additional sub-query or DISTINCT aggregation.\n```\n\nLogical Plan Changes After Rewrite: ```\n- LogicalSort(sort0=[$0(cd_gender)],

`JOIN` operations. Specifically, the `EXISTS` sub-queries in the WHERE clause have been replaced with `LogicalCorrelate` and `LogicalJoin` operations, which are indicative of a transformation from sub-queries to join operations.\n\nStep 2: Parsing the logical plan changes, we observe that the `EXISTS` sub-queries involving `store_sales`, `web_sales`, and `catalog_sales` have been replaced with `JOIN` operations. The `LogicalCorrelate` and `LogicalJoin` operations suggest that the sub-queries are now being handled as part of the main query's FROM clause, with conditions moved to the JOIN conditions. This involves SQL keywords such as `JOIN`, and the transformation affects tables like `store_sales`, `web_sales`, `catalog_sales`, `date_dim`, and `item`.\n\nStep 3: The query rewrite rule contains multiple cases. The changes in the logical plan match Case 2 of the query rewrite rule, which deals with `EXISTS` sub-queries. The transformation involves converting `EXISTS` conditions into JOIN operations, which aligns with the observed changes in the logical plan.\n\nStep 4: In the original SQL query, the `EXISTS` sub-queries were used to filter customers based on their transactions in `store_sales`, `web_sales`, and `catalog_sales`. These sub-queries were correlated with the outer query through the customer key (`c_customer_sk`). The rewrite rule's Case 2 applies here, transforming these `EXISTS` sub-queries into `JOIN` operations. This transformation allows the query to leverage JOINs to directly filter rows based on the presence of matching records in the sales tables, thus optimizing the query execution by reducing the need for nested sub-query evaluations. The detailed changes include replacing the `EXISTS` conditions with `JOIN` operations, ensuring that the conditions previously in the sub-queries are now part of the JOIN conditions, and using `LogicalCorrelate` to maintain the correlation between the outer query and the sub-queries.", 'time': 4.922452211380005}
01:52:59,618 root INFO Generated queries:
Query 1: In Case 1, the SQL query changes involve directly applying the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions to the data source in the `FROM` clause of the inner query. The outer projection layer, which only renamed columns without transforming them, is eliminated. This is evident from the removal of the `LogicalProject` operation and the direct application of the `LogicalAggregate` operation to the data source. The SQL query's `GROUP BY` clause and aggregate functions are simplified by removing unnecessary intermediate steps, leading to a more efficient execution plan.
Query 2: In the original SQL query, the `EXISTS` sub-queries were used to filter customers based on their transactions in `store_sales`, `web_sales`, and `catalog_sales`. These sub-queries were correlated with the outer query through the customer key (`c_customer_sk`). The rewrite rule's Case 2 applies here, transforming these `EXISTS` sub-queries into `JOIN` operations. This transformation allows the query to leverage JOINs to directly filter rows based on the presence of matching records in the sales tables, thus optimizing the query execution by reducing the need for nested sub-query evaluations. The detailed changes include replacing the `EXISTS` conditions with `JOIN` operations, ensuring that the conditions previously in the sub-queries are now part of the JOIN conditions, and using `LogicalCorrelate` to maintain the correlation between the outer query and the sub-queries.
Query 3: The SQL query contains nested `AND`/`OR` conditions within the `EXISTS` clauses. Applying Rule 1, we can transform these conditions to potentially improve execution efficiency. For example, the condition `(x AND y) OR z` can be rewritten as `(x OR z) AND (y OR z)`. This transformation can be applied to the `EXISTS` clauses to simplify the logical structure and potentially enhance performance by reducing the complexity of condition evaluation.
Query 4: The SQL query uses `EXISTS` and `OR` within the `WHERE` clause. Applying Rule 2, we can replace the `OR` conditions with `UNION ALL` operations. This involves rewriting the `EXISTS` clauses that use `OR` into separate subqueries combined with `UNION ALL`. This transformation can improve query performance by allowing the database engine to handle each condition separately, potentially optimizing index usage and reducing execution time.
Query 5: The SQL query performs a `GROUP BY` operation along with `JOIN` operations. Applying Rule 3, we can rearrange the query to perform `GROUP BY` operations earlier, ideally before executing `JOIN` operations. This involves using subqueries for pre-aggregation to reduce the dataset size early in the execution process. By prioritizing grouping operations, we can minimize the workload on subsequent operations like `JOIN`, enhancing overall execution speed and efficiency.
Query 6: The SQL query uses `LIMIT` in conjunction with `ORDER BY`. Applying Rule 4, we can optimize the query by ensuring that the `ORDER BY` operation leverages indexes, if available, to efficiently sort and limit the number of rows retrieved. This encourages the database engine to stop the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained, avoiding full table sorts and reducing execution time.

This is evident from the removal of the `LogicalProject` operation and the direct application of the `LogicalAggregate` operation to the data source.

This transformation allows the query to leverage JOINs to directly filter rows based on the presence of matching records in the sales tables, thus optimizing the query execution by reducing the need for nested sub-query evaluations. The detailed changes include replacing the `EXISTS` conditions with `JOIN` operations, ensuring that the conditions previously in the sub-queries are now part of the JOIN conditions, and using `LogicalCorrelate` to maintain the correlation between the outer query and the sub-queries."""

Query Rewrite 3:
"""The SQL query contains nested `AND`/`OR` conditions within the `EXISTS` clauses. Applying Rule 1, we can transform these conditions to potentially improve execution efficiency. For example, the condition `(x AND y) OR z` can be rewritten as `(x OR z) AND (y OR z)`. This transformation can be applied to the `EXISTS` clauses to simplify the logical structure and potentially enhance performance by reducing the complexity of condition evaluation."""

Query Rewrite 4:
"""The SQL query uses `EXISTS` and `OR` within the `WHERE` clause. Applying Rule 2, we can replace the `OR` conditions with `UNION ALL` operations. This involves rewriting the `EXISTS` clauses that use `OR` into separate subqueries combined with `UNION ALL`. This transformation can improve query performance by allowing the database engine to handle each condition separately, potentially optimizing index usage and reducing execution time."""

Query Rewrite 5:
"""The SQL query performs a `GROUP BY` operation along with `JOIN` operations. Applying Rule 3, we can rearrange the query to perform `GROUP BY` operations earlier, ideally before executing `JOIN` operations. This involves using subqueries for pre-aggregation to reduce the dataset size early in the execution process. By prioritizing grouping operations, we can minimize the workload on subsequent operations like `JOIN`, enhancing overall execution speed and efficiency."""

Query Rewrite 6:
"""The SQL query uses `LIMIT` in conjunction with `ORDER BY`. Applying Rule 4, we can optimize the query by ensuring that the `ORDER BY` operation leverages indexes, if available, to efficiently sort and limit the number of rows retrieved. This encourages the database engine to stop the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained, avoiding full table sorts and reducing execution time."""

Applying Rule 2, we can replace the `OR` conditions with `UNION ALL` operations. This involves rewriting the `EXISTS` clauses that use `OR` into separate subqueries combined with `UNION ALL`. This transformation can improve query performance by allowing the database engine to handle each condition separately, potentially optimizing index usage and reducing execution time."""\n\nQuery Rewrite 5:\n"""The SQL query performs a `GROUP BY` operation along with `JOIN` operations. Applying Rule 3, we can rearrange the query to perform `GROUP BY` operations earlier, ideally before executing `JOIN` operations. This involves using subqueries for pre-aggregation to reduce the dataset size early in the execution process. By prioritizing grouping operations, we can minimize the workload on subsequent operations like `JOIN`, enhancing overall execution speed and efficiency."""\n\nQuery Rewrite 6:\n"""The SQL query uses `LIMIT` in conjunction with `ORDER BY`. Applying Rule 4, we can optimize the query by ensuring that the `ORDER BY` operation leverages indexes, if available, to efficiently sort and limit the number of rows retrieved. This encourages the database engine to stop the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained, avoiding full table sorts and reducing execution time."""'}], 'response': "To cluster the provided query rewrite strategies, we need to identify common themes or techniques among them.

The first strategy involves simplifying the query by directly applying the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions to the data source within the `FROM` clause of the inner query, thereby eliminating unnecessary intermediate steps such as the `LogicalProject` operation. This results in a more efficient execution plan by streamlining the `GROUP BY` clause and aggregate functions. The second strategy focuses on rearranging the query to perform `GROUP BY` operations before executing `JOIN` operations. By using subqueries for pre-aggregation, the dataset size is reduced early in the execution process, which minimizes the workload on subsequent operations like `JOIN`. This prioritization of grouping operations enhances the overall execution speed and efficiency of the query."""\n\n### Suggestion 2:\n"""The provided SQL query can be optimized using several rewrite strategies. The first strategy involves transforming `EXISTS` sub-queries into `JOIN` operations, which allows the query to directly filter rows based on matching records in the sales tables, thereby reducing the need for nested sub-query evaluations and improving execution efficiency. This transformation involves replacing `EXISTS` conditions with `JOIN` operations and ensuring that the conditions previously in the sub-queries are now part of the JOIN conditions, maintaining the correlation between the outer query and sub-queries using `LogicalCorrelate`. The second strategy focuses on simplifying nested `AND`/`OR` conditions within the `EXISTS` clauses by applying logical transformations, such as rewriting `(x AND y) OR z` as `(x OR z) AND (y OR z)`, to enhance performance by reducing condition evaluation complexity. The third strategy suggests replacing `OR` conditions within `EXISTS` clauses with `UNION ALL` operations, which involves rewriting these clauses into separate subqueries combined with `UNION ALL`. This can improve performance by allowing the database engine to handle each condition separately, optimizing index usage, and reducing execution time."""\n\n### Suggestion 3:\n"""The SQL query uses `LIMIT` in conjunction with `ORDER BY`. Applying Rule 4, we can optimize the query by ensuring that the `ORDER BY` operation leverages indexes, if available, to efficiently sort and limit the number of rows retrieved. This encourages the database engine to stop the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained, avoiding full table sorts and reducing execution time."""\n\nQuery Rewrite Rules:\n### Rule AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: - The SQL query contains a `GROUP BY` clause that groups by simple columns (no expressions in the `GROUP BY` list).\n- The aggregate functions in the `SELECT` clause operate directly on columns (no expressions inside the aggregate functions).\n- The `SELECT` clause only contains the columns used in the `GROUP BY` clause and the aggregates without any transformations or additional expressions.\n**Transformations**: - Directly apply the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions to the data source referred to in the `FROM` clause of the inner query before the projection.\n- Eliminate the outer projection layer if it only renames the columns without transforming them.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: - The `SELECT` clause of an outer query precisely matches the columns used in the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions of an inner query, without any column transformations or renamings.\n- The inner `SELECT` only serves as a passthrough for these columns.\n**Transformations**: - Remove the inner `SELECT` layer, directly applying the aggregate functions and `GROUP BY` to the original data source."""\n\n### Rule FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: The query contains a scalar sub-query within the WHERE clause.\n**Transformations**: The scalar sub-query should be transformed into a LEFT JOIN operation with an aggregate function on the column(s) being selected in the sub-query. The JOIN condition uses the correlation ID (the matching column(s) in both outer and sub-query).\n  - Original Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 WHERE column = (SELECT AGG_FUNCTION(column2) FROM table2 WHERE table1.join_column = table2.join_column)\n  - Transformed Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 LEFT JOIN (SELECT join_column, AGG_FUNCTION(column2) AS agg_result FROM table2 GROUP BY join_column) AS sub_query ON table1.join_column = sub_query.join_column WHERE column = sub_query.agg_result\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: The query contains `IN`, `EXISTS`, or `UNIQUE` sub-queries within the WHERE clause that are correlated with the outer query.\n**Transformations**: - For `IN` Sub-queries: Replace the `IN` clause with a JOIN operation and a WHERE condition that checks for non-null values on the side of the sub-query.\n    - Original Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 WHERE column IN (SELECT column2 FROM table2 WHERE table1.join_column = table2.join_column)\n    - Transformed Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.join_column = table2.join_column WHERE table2.column2 IS NOT NULL\n  - For `EXISTS` Sub-queries: Convert the `EXISTS` condition into a JOIN operation, using WHERE to filter rows that match the JOIN condition.\n    - Original Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM table2 WHERE table1.join_column = table2.join_class)\n    - Transformed Query Structure: SELECT DISTINCT table1.* FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.join_column = table2.join_column\n  - For `UNIQUE` Sub-queries: Since `UNIQUE` requires a bit more complex handling not directly mappable to a standard JOIN, it should be considered a special case where the goal is to ensure that rows from the outer query match a unique set in the sub-query. This might not translate directly into SQL syntax without additional sub-query or DISTINCT aggregation."""\n\n### Rule SORT_PROJECT_TRANSPOSE:\n"""**Conditions**: If a SQL query executes a sort operation on columns that are directly referenced in the SELECT list or through expressions that are strictly monotonic transformations of these columns, and the sort operation directly follows these projections (SELECT statements), the sort operation can be pushed to operate directly on the table (FROM clause) before the projection.\n**Transformations**: 1. Check Compatibility: Ensure both sort and project (SELECT and ORDER BY clauses) involve compatible operations that relate directly to the raw column data or involve monotonic transformations.\n2. Analyze Order By Fields: Verify that each column in the ORDER BY clause is directly represented in the SELECT list or is a derived column through a monotonic transformation (e.g., casting integers to floats where the order is preserved).\n3. Adjust SQL Query: Rewrite the query so that sorting (ORDER BY clause) is applied to the raw table data in the FROM clause rather than after the projection. This might involve introducing a subquery or CTE (Common Table Expression) where the sorting is applied first, followed by the projections.\n4. Optimize Projection: Ensure that the SELECT list in the outer query matches the original projection, applying on top of the sorted data now."""\n\n### Rule JOIN_TO_CORRELATE:\n"""**Conditions**: The join type is either INNER JOIN or LEFT JOIN. There are no requirements in the query that would inherently create NULL values on the left side when there are no matching rows on the right side (for INNER JOIN, this condition is naturally met; for LEFT JOIN, it is met if every row on the left side has at least one corresponding row on the right side according to the join condition).\n**Transformations**: 1. Identify the INNER JOIN or LEFT JOIN condition in the SQL query. 2. Extract the ON clause representing the join condition. 3. For INNER JOIN: - Replace the INNER JOIN with a WHERE EXISTS clause, moving the original join condition into the WHERE clause of a subquery that selects from the right side table. Reference the left side columns as correlation variables in the subquery\'s WHERE clause. - Example Transformation: SELECT * FROM left_table INNER JOIN right_table ON left_table.id = right_table.foreign_id Becomes: SELECT * FROM left_table WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM right_table WHERE left_table.id = right_table.foreign_id) 4. For LEFT JOIN: - Replace the LEFT JOIN with a LEFT OUTER JOIN subquery that is correlated to the outer query. In the SELECT clause of the outer query, include a CASE statement or similar logic to handle selection from the subquery result. - Example Transformation: SELECT left_table.*, right_table.* FROM left_table LEFT JOIN right_table ON left_table.id = right_table.foreign_id Becomes: SELECT left_table.*, COALESCE(subquery.alias1, \'default\') FROM left_table LEFT OUTER JOIN (SELECT foreign_id, column1 AS alias1 FROM right_table) subquery ON left_table.id = subquery.foreign_id"""'}], 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'stream': False, 'temperature': 0.1}}

There are no requirements in the query that would inherently create NULL values on the left side when there are no matching rows on the right side (for INNER JOIN, this condition is naturally met; for LEFT JOIN, it is met if every row on the left side has at least one corresponding row on the right side according to the join condition).\n**Transformations**: 1. Identify the INNER JOIN or LEFT JOIN condition in the SQL query. 2. Extract the ON clause representing the join condition. 3. For INNER JOIN: - Replace the INNER JOIN with a WHERE EXISTS clause, moving the original join condition into the WHERE clause of a subquery that selects from the right side table. Reference the left side columns as correlation variables in the subquery\'s WHERE clause. - Example Transformation: SELECT * FROM left_table INNER JOIN right_table ON left_table.id = right_table.foreign_id Becomes: SELECT * FROM left_table WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM right_table WHERE left_table.id = right_table.foreign_id) 4. For LEFT JOIN: - Replace the LEFT JOIN with a LEFT OUTER JOIN subquery that is correlated to the outer query. In the SELECT clause of the outer query, include a CASE statement or similar logic to handle selection from the subquery result. - Example Transformation: SELECT left_table.*, right_table.* FROM left_table LEFT JOIN right_table ON left_table.id = right_table.foreign_id Becomes: SELECT left_table.*, COALESCE(subquery.alias1, \'default\') FROM left_table LEFT OUTER JOIN (SELECT foreign_id, column1 AS alias1 FROM right_table) subquery ON left_table.id = subquery.foreign_id"""'}], 'response': 'Step 1: Evaluate each suggestion against the provided rules.\n\n### Suggestion 1:\n- **Strategy 1**: Simplifying the query by applying `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions directly to the data source within the `FROM` clause aligns with **Rule AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE**.

The first strategy involves simplifying the query by directly applying the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions to the data source within the `FROM` clause of the inner query, thereby eliminating unnecessary intermediate steps such as the `LogicalProject` operation. This results in a more efficient execution plan by streamlining the `GROUP BY` clause and aggregate functions. The second strategy focuses on rearranging the query to perform `GROUP BY` operations before executing `JOIN` operations. By using subqueries for pre-aggregation, the dataset size is reduced early in the execution process, which minimizes the workload on subsequent operations like `JOIN`. This prioritization of grouping operations enhances the overall execution speed and efficiency of the query."""\n\n### Suggestion 2:\n"""The provided SQL query can be optimized using several rewrite strategies. The first strategy involves transforming `EXISTS` sub-queries into `JOIN` operations, which allows the query to directly filter rows based on matching records in the sales tables, thereby reducing the need for nested sub-query evaluations and improving execution efficiency. This transformation involves replacing `EXISTS` conditions with `JOIN` operations and ensuring that the conditions previously in the sub-queries are now part of the JOIN conditions, maintaining the correlation between the outer query and sub-queries using `LogicalCorrelate`. The second strategy focuses on simplifying nested `AND`/`OR` conditions within the `EXISTS` clauses by applying logical transformations, such as rewriting `(x AND y) OR z` as `(x OR z) AND (y OR z)`, to enhance performance by reducing condition evaluation complexity. The third strategy suggests replacing `OR` conditions within `EXISTS` clauses with `UNION ALL` operations, which involves rewriting these clauses into separate subqueries combined with `UNION ALL`. This can improve performance by allowing the database engine to handle each condition separately, optimizing index usage, and reducing execution time."""\n\n### Suggestion 3:\n"""The SQL query uses `LIMIT` in conjunction with `ORDER BY`. Applying Rule 4, we can optimize the query by ensuring that the `ORDER BY` operation leverages indexes, if available, to efficiently sort and limit the number of rows retrieved. This encourages the database engine to stop the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained, avoiding full table sorts and reducing execution time."""\n\nQuery Rewrite Rule Sets:\n### AGGREGATE Operator Rules: ["AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE"]\n\n### CORRELATE Operator Rules: ["FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE"]\n\n### FILTER Operator Rules: ["FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE"]\n\n### PROJECT Operator Rules: ["AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE", "SORT_PROJECT_TRANSPOSE"]\n\n### SORT Operator Rules: ["SORT_PROJECT_TRANSPOSE"]\n\nQuery Rewrite Rule Explanations:\n### Rule AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: - The SQL query contains a `GROUP BY` clause that groups by simple columns (no expressions in the `GROUP BY` list).\n- The aggregate functions in the `SELECT` clause operate directly on columns (no expressions inside the aggregate functions).\n- The `SELECT` clause only contains the columns used in the `GROUP BY` clause and the aggregates without any transformations or additional expressions.\n**Transformations**: - Directly apply the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions to the data source referred to in the `FROM` clause of the inner query before the projection.\n- Eliminate the outer projection layer if it only renames the columns without transforming them.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: - The `SELECT` clause of an outer query precisely matches the columns used in the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions of an inner query, without any column transformations or renamings.\n- The inner `SELECT` only serves as a passthrough for these columns.\n**Transformations**: - Remove the inner `SELECT` layer, directly applying the aggregate functions and `GROUP BY` to the original data source."""\n\n### Rule FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: The query contains a scalar sub-query within the WHERE clause.\n**Transformations**: The scalar sub-query should be transformed into a LEFT JOIN operation with an aggregate function on the column(s) being selected in the sub-query.

The first strategy involves simplifying the query by directly applying the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions to the data source within the `FROM` clause of the inner query, thereby eliminating unnecessary intermediate steps such as the `LogicalProject` operation. This results in a more efficient execution plan by streamlining the `GROUP BY` clause and aggregate functions. The second strategy focuses on rearranging the query to perform `GROUP BY` operations before executing `JOIN` operations. By using subqueries for pre-aggregation, the dataset size is reduced early in the execution process, which minimizes the workload on subsequent operations like `JOIN`. This prioritization of grouping operations enhances the overall execution speed and efficiency of the query."""\n\n### Suggestion 2:\n"""The provided SQL query can be optimized using several rewrite strategies. The first strategy involves transforming `EXISTS` sub-queries into `JOIN` operations, which allows the query to directly filter rows based on matching records in the sales tables, thereby reducing the need for nested sub-query evaluations and improving execution efficiency. This transformation involves replacing `EXISTS` conditions with `JOIN` operations and ensuring that the conditions previously in the sub-queries are now part of the JOIN conditions, maintaining the correlation between the outer query and sub-queries using `LogicalCorrelate`. The second strategy focuses on simplifying nested `AND`/`OR` conditions within the `EXISTS` clauses by applying logical transformations, such as rewriting `(x AND y) OR z` as `(x OR z) AND (y OR z)`, to enhance performance by reducing condition evaluation complexity. The third strategy suggests replacing `OR` conditions within `EXISTS` clauses with `UNION ALL` operations, which involves rewriting these clauses into separate subqueries combined with `UNION ALL`. This can improve performance by allowing the database engine to handle each condition separately, optimizing index usage, and reducing execution time."""\n\n### Suggestion 3:\n"""The SQL query uses `LIMIT` in conjunction with `ORDER BY`. Applying Rule 4, we can optimize the query by ensuring that the `ORDER BY` operation leverages indexes, if available, to efficiently sort and limit the number of rows retrieved.

The first strategy involves simplifying the query by directly applying the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions to the data source within the `FROM` clause of the inner query, thereby eliminating unnecessary intermediate steps such as the `LogicalProject` operation. This results in a more efficient execution plan by streamlining the `GROUP BY` clause and aggregate functions. The second strategy focuses on rearranging the query to perform `GROUP BY` operations before executing `JOIN` operations. By using subqueries for pre-aggregation, the dataset size is reduced early in the execution process, which minimizes the workload on subsequent operations like `JOIN`. This prioritization of grouping operations enhances the overall execution speed and efficiency of the query."""\n\n### Suggestion 2:\n"""The provided SQL query can be optimized using several rewrite strategies. The first strategy involves transforming `EXISTS` sub-queries into `JOIN` operations, which allows the query to directly filter rows based on matching records in the sales tables, thereby reducing the need for nested sub-query evaluations and improving execution efficiency. This transformation involves replacing `EXISTS` conditions with `JOIN` operations and ensuring that the conditions previously in the sub-queries are now part of the JOIN conditions, maintaining the correlation between the outer query and sub-queries using `LogicalCorrelate`. The second strategy focuses on simplifying nested `AND`/`OR` conditions within the `EXISTS` clauses by applying logical transformations, such as rewriting `(x AND y) OR z` as `(x OR z) AND (y OR z)`, to enhance performance by reducing condition evaluation complexity. The third strategy suggests replacing `OR` conditions within `EXISTS` clauses with `UNION ALL` operations, which involves rewriting these clauses into separate subqueries combined with `UNION ALL`. This can improve performance by allowing the database engine to handle each condition separately, optimizing index usage, and reducing execution time."""\n\n### Suggestion 3:\n"""The SQL query uses `LIMIT` in conjunction with `ORDER BY`. Applying Rule 4, we can optimize the query by ensuring that the `ORDER BY` operation leverages indexes, if available, to efficiently sort and limit the number of rows retrieved. This encourages the database engine to stop the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained, avoiding full table sorts and reducing execution time."""\n\nQuery Rewrite Rules:\n### Rule AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: - The SQL query contains a `GROUP BY` clause that groups by simple columns (no expressions in the `GROUP BY` list).\n- The aggregate functions in the `SELECT` clause operate directly on columns (no expressions inside the aggregate functions).\n- The `SELECT` clause only contains the columns used in the `GROUP BY` clause and the aggregates without any transformations or additional expressions.\n**Transformations**: - Directly apply the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions to the data source referred to in the `FROM` clause of the inner query before the projection.\n- Eliminate the outer projection layer if it only renames the columns without transforming them.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: - The `SELECT` clause of an outer query precisely matches the columns used in the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions of an inner query, without any column transformations or renamings.\n- The inner `SELECT` only serves as a passthrough for these columns.\n**Transformations**: - Remove the inner `SELECT` layer, directly applying the aggregate functions and `GROUP BY` to the original data source."""\n\n### Rule FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: The query contains a scalar sub-query within the WHERE clause.\n**Transformations**: The scalar sub-query should be transformed into a LEFT JOIN operation with an aggregate function on the column(s) being selected in the sub-query. The JOIN condition uses the correlation ID (the matching column(s) in both outer and sub-query).\n  - Original Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 WHERE column = (SELECT AGG_FUNCTION(column2) FROM table2 WHERE table1.join_column = table2.join_column)\n  - Transformed Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 LEFT JOIN (SELECT join_column, AGG_FUNCTION(column2) AS agg_result FROM table2 GROUP BY join_column) AS sub_query ON table1.join_column = sub_query.join_column WHERE column = sub_query.agg_result\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: The query contains `IN`, `EXISTS`, or `UNIQUE` sub-queries within the WHERE clause that are correlated with the outer query.\n**Transformations**: - For `IN` Sub-queries: Replace the `IN` clause with a JOIN operation and a WHERE condition that checks for non-null values on the side of the sub-query.\n    - Original Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 WHERE column IN (SELECT column2 FROM table2 WHERE table1.join_column = table2.join_column)\n    - Transformed Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.join_column = table2.join_column WHERE table2.column2 IS NOT NULL\n  - For `EXISTS` Sub-queries: Convert the `EXISTS` condition into a JOIN operation, using WHERE to filter rows that match the JOIN condition.\n    - Original Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM table2 WHERE table1.join_column = table2.join_class)\n    - Transformed Query Structure: SELECT DISTINCT table1.* FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.join_column = table2.join_column\n  - For `UNIQUE` Sub-queries: Since `UNIQUE` requires a bit more complex handling not directly mappable to a standard JOIN, it should be considered a special case where the goal is to ensure that rows from the outer query match a unique set in the sub-query. This might not translate directly into SQL syntax without additional sub-query or DISTINCT aggregation."""\n\n### Rule SORT_PROJECT_TRANSPOSE:\n"""**Conditions**: If a SQL query executes a sort operation on columns that are directly referenced in the SELECT list or through expressions that are strictly monotonic transformations of these columns, and the sort operation directly follows these projections (SELECT statements), the sort operation can be pushed to operate directly on the table (FROM clause) before the projection.\n**Transformations**: 1. Check Compatibility: Ensure both sort and project (SELECT and ORDER BY clauses) involve compatible operations that relate directly to the raw column data or involve monotonic transformations.\n2. Analyze Order By Fields: Verify that each column in the ORDER BY clause is directly represented in the SELECT list or is a derived column through a monotonic transformation (e.g., casting integers to floats where the order is preserved).\n3. Adjust SQL Query: Rewrite the query so that sorting (ORDER BY clause) is applied to the raw table data in the FROM clause rather than after the projection. This might involve introducing a subquery or CTE (Common Table Expression) where the sorting is applied first, followed by the projections.\n4. Optimize Projection: Ensure that the SELECT list in the outer query matches the original projection, applying on top of the sorted data now."""\n\nRule Subset Sequences:\n### Rule Sequence 1: ["AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE"]\n\n### Rule Sequence 2: ["FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE"]\n\n### Rule Sequence 3: ["FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE"]\n\n### Rule Sequence 4: ["AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE", "SORT_PROJECT_TRANSPOSE"]\n\n### Rule Sequence 5: ["SORT_PROJECT_TRANSPOSE"]'}], 'response': 'To optimize the given SQL query, we need to apply the provided query rewrite rules in a sequence that maximizes efficiency.

The first strategy involves simplifying the query by directly applying the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions to the data source within the `FROM` clause of the inner query, thereby eliminating unnecessary intermediate steps such as the `LogicalProject` operation. This results in a more efficient execution plan by streamlining the `GROUP BY` clause and aggregate functions. The second strategy focuses on rearranging the query to perform `GROUP BY` operations before executing `JOIN` operations. By using subqueries for pre-aggregation, the dataset size is reduced early in the execution process, which minimizes the workload on subsequent operations like `JOIN`. This prioritization of grouping operations enhances the overall execution speed and efficiency of the query."""\n\n### Suggestion 2:\n"""The provided SQL query can be optimized using several rewrite strategies. The first strategy involves transforming `EXISTS` sub-queries into `JOIN` operations, which allows the query to directly filter rows based on matching records in the sales tables, thereby reducing the need for nested sub-query evaluations and improving execution efficiency. This transformation involves replacing `EXISTS` conditions with `JOIN` operations and ensuring that the conditions previously in the sub-queries are now part of the JOIN conditions, maintaining the correlation between the outer query and sub-queries using `LogicalCorrelate`. The second strategy focuses on simplifying nested `AND`/`OR` conditions within the `EXISTS` clauses by applying logical transformations, such as rewriting `(x AND y) OR z` as `(x OR z) AND (y OR z)`, to enhance performance by reducing condition evaluation complexity. The third strategy suggests replacing `OR` conditions within `EXISTS` clauses with `UNION ALL` operations, which involves rewriting these clauses into separate subqueries combined with `UNION ALL`. This can improve performance by allowing the database engine to handle each condition separately, optimizing index usage, and reducing execution time."""\n\n### Suggestion 3:\n"""The SQL query uses `LIMIT` in conjunction with `ORDER BY`. Applying Rule 4, we can optimize the query by ensuring that the `ORDER BY` operation leverages indexes, if available, to efficiently sort and limit the number of rows retrieved. This encourages the database engine to stop the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained, avoiding full table sorts and reducing execution time."""\n\nQuery Rewrite Rules:\n### Rule AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: - The SQL query contains a `GROUP BY` clause that groups by simple columns (no expressions in the `GROUP BY` list).\n- The aggregate functions in the `SELECT` clause operate directly on columns (no expressions inside the aggregate functions).\n- The `SELECT` clause only contains the columns used in the `GROUP BY` clause and the aggregates without any transformations or additional expressions.\n**Transformations**: - Directly apply the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions to the data source referred to in the `FROM` clause of the inner query before the projection.\n- Eliminate the outer projection layer if it only renames the columns without transforming them.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: - The `SELECT` clause of an outer query precisely matches the columns used in the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions of an inner query, without any column transformations or renamings.\n- The inner `SELECT` only serves as a passthrough for these columns.\n**Transformations**: - Remove the inner `SELECT` layer, directly applying the aggregate functions and `GROUP BY` to the original data source."""\n\n### Rule FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: The query contains a scalar sub-query within the WHERE clause.\n**Transformations**: The scalar sub-query should be transformed into a LEFT JOIN operation with an aggregate function on the column(s) being selected in the sub-query. The JOIN condition uses the correlation ID (the matching column(s) in both outer and sub-query).\n  - Original Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 WHERE column = (SELECT AGG_FUNCTION(column2) FROM table2 WHERE table1.join_column = table2.join_column)\n  - Transformed Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 LEFT JOIN (SELECT join_column, AGG_FUNCTION(column2) AS agg_result FROM table2 GROUP BY join_column) AS sub_query ON table1.join_column = sub_query.join_column WHERE column = sub_query.agg_result\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: The query contains `IN`, `EXISTS`, or `UNIQUE` sub-queries within the WHERE clause that are correlated with the outer query.\n**Transformations**: - For `IN` Sub-queries: Replace the `IN` clause with a JOIN operation and a WHERE condition that checks for non-null values on the side of the sub-query.\n    - Original Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 WHERE column IN (SELECT column2 FROM table2 WHERE table1.join_column = table2.join_column)\n    - Transformed Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.join_column = table2.join_column WHERE table2.column2 IS NOT NULL\n  - For `EXISTS` Sub-queries: Convert the `EXISTS` condition into a JOIN operation, using WHERE to filter rows that match the JOIN condition.\n    - Original Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM table2 WHERE table1.join_column = table2.join_class)\n    - Transformed Query Structure: SELECT DISTINCT table1.* FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.join_column = table2.join_column\n  - For `UNIQUE` Sub-queries: Since `UNIQUE` requires a bit more complex handling not directly mappable to a standard JOIN, it should be considered a special case where the goal is to ensure that rows from the outer query match a unique set in the sub-query. This might not translate directly into SQL syntax without additional sub-query or DISTINCT aggregation."""\n\n### Rule SORT_PROJECT_TRANSPOSE:\n"""**Conditions**: If a SQL query executes a sort operation on columns that are directly referenced in the SELECT list or through expressions that are strictly monotonic transformations of these columns, and the sort operation directly follows these projections (SELECT statements), the sort operation can be pushed to operate directly on the table (FROM clause) before the projection.\n**Transformations**: 1. Check Compatibility: Ensure both sort and project (SELECT and ORDER BY clauses) involve compatible operations that relate directly to the raw column data or involve monotonic transformations.\n2. Analyze Order By Fields: Verify that each column in the ORDER BY clause is directly represented in the SELECT list or is a derived column through a monotonic transformation (e.g., casting integers to floats where the order is preserved).\n3. Adjust SQL Query: Rewrite the query so that sorting (ORDER BY clause) is applied to the raw table data in the FROM clause rather than after the projection. This might involve introducing a subquery or CTE (Common Table Expression) where the sorting is applied first, followed by the projections.\n4. Optimize Projection: Ensure that the SELECT list in the outer query matches the original projection, applying on top of the sorted data now."""\n\nArranged Rule Sequence: ["AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE", "FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE", "SORT_PROJECT_TRANSPOSE"]\n\nUtilized Rules: ["AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE", "SORT_PROJECT_TRANSPOSE"]\n\nUnutilized Rules: ["FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE"]'}], 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'stream': False, 'temperature': 0.1}}

The first strategy involves simplifying the query by directly applying the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions to the data source within the `FROM` clause of the inner query, thereby eliminating unnecessary intermediate steps such as the `LogicalProject` operation. This results in a more efficient execution plan by streamlining the `GROUP BY` clause and aggregate functions. The second strategy focuses on rearranging the query to perform `GROUP BY` operations before executing `JOIN` operations. By using subqueries for pre-aggregation, the dataset size is reduced early in the execution process, which minimizes the workload on subsequent operations like `JOIN`. This prioritization of grouping operations enhances the overall execution speed and efficiency of the query."""\n\n### Suggestion 2:\n"""The provided SQL query can be optimized using several rewrite strategies. The first strategy involves transforming `EXISTS` sub-queries into `JOIN` operations, which allows the query to directly filter rows based on matching records in the sales tables, thereby reducing the need for nested sub-query evaluations and improving execution efficiency. This transformation involves replacing `EXISTS` conditions with `JOIN` operations and ensuring that the conditions previously in the sub-queries are now part of the JOIN conditions, maintaining the correlation between the outer query and sub-queries using `LogicalCorrelate`. The second strategy focuses on simplifying nested `AND`/`OR` conditions within the `EXISTS` clauses by applying logical transformations, such as rewriting `(x AND y) OR z` as `(x OR z) AND (y OR z)`, to enhance performance by reducing condition evaluation complexity. The third strategy suggests replacing `OR` conditions within `EXISTS` clauses with `UNION ALL` operations, which involves rewriting these clauses into separate subqueries combined with `UNION ALL`. This can improve performance by allowing the database engine to handle each condition separately, optimizing index usage, and reducing execution time."""\n\n### Suggestion 3:\n"""The SQL query uses `LIMIT` in conjunction with `ORDER BY`. Applying Rule 4, we can optimize the query by ensuring that the `ORDER BY` operation leverages indexes, if available, to efficiently sort and limit the number of rows retrieved. This encourages the database engine to stop the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained, avoiding full table sorts and reducing execution time."""\n\nQuery Rewrite Rules:\n### Rule AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: - The SQL query contains a `GROUP BY` clause that groups by simple columns (no expressions in the `GROUP BY` list).\n- The aggregate functions in the `SELECT` clause operate directly on columns (no expressions inside the aggregate functions).\n- The `SELECT` clause only contains the columns used in the `GROUP BY` clause and the aggregates without any transformations or additional expressions.\n**Transformations**: - Directly apply the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions to the data source referred to in the `FROM` clause of the inner query before the projection.\n- Eliminate the outer projection layer if it only renames the columns without transforming them.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: - The `SELECT` clause of an outer query precisely matches the columns used in the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions of an inner query, without any column transformations or renamings.\n- The inner `SELECT` only serves as a passthrough for these columns.\n**Transformations**: - Remove the inner `SELECT` layer, directly applying the aggregate functions and `GROUP BY` to the original data source."""\n\n### Rule FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: The query contains a scalar sub-query within the WHERE clause.\n**Transformations**: The scalar sub-query should be transformed into a LEFT JOIN operation with an aggregate function on the column(s) being selected in the sub-query. The JOIN condition uses the correlation ID (the matching column(s) in both outer and sub-query).\n  - Original Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 WHERE column = (SELECT AGG_FUNCTION(column2) FROM table2 WHERE table1.join_column = table2.join_column)\n  - Transformed Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 LEFT JOIN (SELECT join_column, AGG_FUNCTION(column2) AS agg_result FROM table2 GROUP BY join_column) AS sub_query ON table1.join_column = sub_query.join_column WHERE column = sub_query.agg_result\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: The query contains `IN`, `EXISTS`, or `UNIQUE` sub-queries within the WHERE clause that are correlated with the outer query.\n**Transformations**: - For `IN` Sub-queries: Replace the `IN` clause with a JOIN operation and a WHERE condition that checks for non-null values on the side of the sub-query.\n    - Original Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 WHERE column IN (SELECT column2 FROM table2 WHERE table1.join_column = table2.join_column)\n    - Transformed Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.join_column = table2.join_column WHERE table2.column2 IS NOT NULL\n  - For `EXISTS` Sub-queries: Convert the `EXISTS` condition into a JOIN operation, using WHERE to filter rows that match the JOIN condition.\n    - Original Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM table2 WHERE table1.join_column = table2.join_class)\n    - Transformed Query Structure: SELECT DISTINCT table1.* FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.join_column = table2.join_column\n  - For `UNIQUE` Sub-queries: Since `UNIQUE` requires a bit more complex handling not directly mappable to a standard JOIN, it should be considered a special case where the goal is to ensure that rows from the outer query match a unique set in the sub-query. This might not translate directly into SQL syntax without additional sub-query or DISTINCT aggregation."""\n\n### Rule SORT_PROJECT_TRANSPOSE:\n"""**Conditions**: If a SQL query executes a sort operation on columns that are directly referenced in the SELECT list or through expressions that are strictly monotonic transformations of these columns, and the sort operation directly follows these projections (SELECT statements), the sort operation can be pushed to operate directly on the table (FROM clause) before the projection.\n**Transformations**: 1. Check Compatibility: Ensure both sort and project (SELECT and ORDER BY clauses) involve compatible operations that relate directly to the raw column data or involve monotonic transformations.\n2. Analyze Order By Fields: Verify that each column in the ORDER BY clause is directly represented in the SELECT list or is a derived column through a monotonic transformation (e.g., casting integers to floats where the order is preserved).\n3. Adjust SQL Query: Rewrite the query so that sorting (ORDER BY clause) is applied to the raw table data in the FROM clause rather than after the projection. This might involve introducing a subquery or CTE (Common Table Expression) where the sorting is applied first, followed by the projections.\n4. Optimize Projection: Ensure that the SELECT list in the outer query matches the original projection, applying on top of the sorted data now."""\n\nArranged Rule Sequence: ["AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE", "FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE", "SORT_PROJECT_TRANSPOSE"]\n\nUtilized Rules: ["AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE", "SORT_PROJECT_TRANSPOSE"]\n\nUnutilized Rules: ["FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE"]'}], 'response': 'Step 1: The unutilized rule "FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE" matches the provided query rewrite suggestions, particularly Suggestion 2, which involves transforming `EXISTS` sub-queries into `JOIN` operations.
