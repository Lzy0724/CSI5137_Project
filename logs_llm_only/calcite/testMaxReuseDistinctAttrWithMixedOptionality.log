the query. The query is:\n\n```sql\nselect sum(distinct deptno), count(distinct deptno), max(deptno) from emp;\n```\n\nThe query involves two distinct aggregate functions: `sum(distinct deptno)` and `count(distinct deptno)`. These types of operations can often be optimized by expanding them into joins or other operations that can be more efficiently executed by the database engine.\n\n### Step-by-step Optimization:\n\n1. **AGGREGATE_EXPAND_DISTINCT_AGGREGATES_TO_JOIN**: This rule is specifically designed to handle distinct aggregates by expanding them into joins. By applying this rule, we can transform the distinct aggregates into a form that can be more efficiently processed by the database engine.\n\n   - **Transformation**: The distinct aggregates `sum(distinct deptno)` and `count(distinct deptno)` can be expanded into a join operation that first selects distinct `deptno` values and then applies the aggregate functions on the result.\n\n2. **AGGREGATE_REDUCE_FUNCTIONS**: After expanding the distinct aggregates, we can apply this rule to simplify the aggregate functions if possible. This rule reduces aggregate functions to simpler forms, which can further enhance performance.\n\n   - **Transformation**: This rule will ensure that any unnecessary complexity in the aggregate functions is reduced, potentially leading to a more efficient execution plan.\n\nBy applying these rules, we can transform the original query into a more optimized version. Let\'s list the selected rules and apply them:\n\n```python\n[\n    "AGGREGATE_EXPAND_DISTINCT_AGGREGATES_TO_JOIN",\n    "AGGREGATE_REDUCE_FUNCTIONS"\n]\n```\n\n### Transformed Query:\n\nAfter applying the rules, the query might be transformed into something like this:\n\n```sql\nselect sum(d.deptno), count(d.deptno), max(e.deptno)\nfrom (select distinct deptno from emp) d\njoin emp e on d.deptno = e.deptno;\n```\n\n- The subquery `(select distinct deptno from emp)` extracts the distinct `deptno` values.\n- The join operation ensures that the aggregates are computed over the distinct values.\n- The `sum` and `count` functions are applied to the distinct `deptno` values, while `max` is applied directly to the `deptno` from the `emp` table.\n\nThis transformation leverages the database\'s ability to efficiently handle joins and distinct operations, potentially leading to better performance.', 'time': 6.794790267944336}

the query. The query is:\n\n```sql\nselect sum(distinct deptno), count(distinct deptno), max(deptno) from emp;\n```\n\nThe query involves two distinct aggregate functions: `sum(distinct deptno)` and `count(distinct deptno)`. These distinct aggregates can be optimized by expanding them into a more efficient form.\n\n### Step-by-step Optimization:\n\n1. **AGGREGATE_EXPAND_DISTINCT_AGGREGATES**: \n   - This rule is specifically designed to handle distinct aggregates by expanding them into a more efficient form. By applying this rule, we can transform the distinct aggregates into a form that can be processed more efficiently by the database engine.\n   - Applying this rule will result in the distinct aggregates being expanded, potentially involving a subquery or a join to handle the distinct values separately before applying the aggregate functions.\n\n2. **AGGREGATE_REDUCE_FUNCTIONS**:\n   - After expanding the distinct aggregates, we can apply this rule to simplify the aggregate functions if possible. This rule reduces aggregate functions to simpler forms, which can further enhance performance.\n\nLet\'s apply these rules to transform the query:\n\n### Applying the Rules:\n\n1. **AGGREGATE_EXPAND_DISTINCT_AGGREGATES**:\n   - The query can be rewritten to handle distinct values separately:\n   ```sql\n   select sum(t.deptno), count(t.deptno), max(e.deptno)\n   from (select distinct deptno from emp) t, emp e;\n   ```\n   - Here, a subquery `t` is used to select distinct `deptno` values, which are then aggregated using `sum` and `count`. The `max` function can still be applied directly to the `deptno` column from the `emp` table.\n\n2. **AGGREGATE_REDUCE_FUNCTIONS**:\n   - In this case, the aggregate functions are already in their simplest form after the expansion, so this rule might not make further changes. However, it ensures that no unnecessary complexity remains in the aggregate functions.\n\nBy applying these rules, we have optimized the query to handle distinct aggregates more efficiently.\n\n### Final Optimized Query:\n\n```sql\nselect sum(t.deptno), count(t.deptno), max(e.deptno)\nfrom (select distinct deptno from emp) t, emp e;\n```\n\n### Selected Rules:\n\n```python\n[\n    "AGGREGATE_EXPAND_DISTINCT_AGGREGATES",\n    "AGGREGATE_REDUCE_FUNCTIONS"\n]\n```', 'time': 6.921706676483154}
