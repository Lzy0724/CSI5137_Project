from dept);\n```\n\nThis query uses the `SOME` operator, which is equivalent to `ANY`. The `SOME` operator checks if the condition is true for at least one of the values returned by the subquery. In this case, it checks if `e1.empno` is greater than any of the `deptno` values from the `dept` table.\n\nTo optimize this query, we can consider the following:\n\n1. **FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE**: This rule converts sub-queries from filter expressions into Correlate instances. This can help in optimizing subqueries by transforming them into a more efficient form.\n\n2. **FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS**: This rule reduces constants inside a LogicalFilter. It can be useful if there are any constant expressions that can be simplified.\n\n3. **FILTER_INTO_JOIN**: This rule tries to push filter expressions into a join condition and into the inputs of the join. However, this rule is more applicable when there is an explicit join in the query, which is not the case here.\n\n4. **FILTER_AGGREGATE_TRANSPOSE**: This rule pushes a Filter past an Aggregate. It is not applicable here since there is no aggregate function involved.\n\n5. **FILTER_PROJECT_TRANSPOSE**: This rule pushes a Filter past a Project. It is not applicable here since there is no project operation involved.\n\nGiven the nature of the query, the most relevant rule to apply is **FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE**. This rule can potentially transform the subquery into a more efficient form by using a Correlate, which can improve performance by reducing the number of times the subquery is executed.\n\nLet\'s apply the **FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE** rule:\n\n1. **FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE**: Convert the subquery into a Correlate instance. This transformation can help in optimizing the execution plan by allowing the subquery to be executed in a more efficient manner.\n\nAfter applying this rule, the query might be transformed into a form that uses a Correlate, which is typically more efficient for subqueries.\n\nSince there are no other applicable rules from the provided list that can further optimize the query, we conclude the optimization process here.\n\nThe selected rule is:\n\n```python\n["FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE"]\n```', 'time': 5.59438157081604}
