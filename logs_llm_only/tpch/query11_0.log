inefficiencies. The query involves a join between three tables (`partsupp`, `supplier`, and `nation`) and a subquery with similar joins and conditions. The main inefficiency here is the repeated computation of the same aggregate in both the main query and the subquery. We can optimize this by eliminating the subquery and computing the aggregate once.\n\nLet\'s apply the following reasoning steps:\n\n1. **Identify Redundant Computation**: The subquery computes the same aggregate as the main query but scales it by a constant factor. We can compute this aggregate once and use it in both the main query and the subquery condition.\n\n2. **Rewrite the Query**: We can use a Common Table Expression (CTE) to compute the aggregate once and then reference it in both the main query and the condition. This avoids the need for a subquery and reduces the computational overhead.\n\n3. **Apply Query Rewrite Rules**: We will use the `AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE` rule to merge the aggregate computation into a single step, and the `FILTER_AGGREGATE_TRANSPOSE` rule to push the filter past the aggregate.\n\nLet\'s transform the query step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Use a CTE to Compute the Aggregate Once\n\nWe will compute the aggregate sum in a CTE and use it in both the main query and the condition.\n\n```sql\nwith aggregate_value as (\n    select\n        sum(ps_supplycost * ps_availqty) as total_value\n    from\n        partsupp,\n        supplier,\n        nation\n    where\n        ps_suppkey = s_suppkey\n        and s_nationkey = n_nationkey\n        and n_name = \'INDIA\'\n)\nselect\n    ps_partkey,\n    sum(ps_supplycost * ps_availqty) as "value"\nfrom\n    partsupp,\n    supplier,\n    nation,\n    aggregate_value\nwhere\n    ps_suppkey = s_suppkey\n    and s_nationkey = n_nationkey\n    and n_name = \'INDIA\'\ngroup by\n    ps_partkey\nhaving\n    sum(ps_supplycost * ps_availqty) > aggregate_value.total_value * 0.0000100000\norder by\n    "value" desc\nlimit 1;\n```\n\n### Step 2: Apply Query Rewrite Rules\n\n- **AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE**: Merge the aggregate computation into a single step by using the CTE.\n- **FILTER_AGGREGATE_TRANSPOSE**: Push the filter past the aggregate to optimize the execution plan.\n\nThe final optimized query is:\n\n```sql\nwith aggregate_value as (\n    select\n        sum(ps_supplycost * ps_availqty) as total_value\n    from\n        partsupp,\n        supplier,\n        nation\n    where\n        ps_suppkey = s_suppkey\n        and s_nationkey = n_nationkey\n        and n_name = \'INDIA\'\n)\nselect\n    ps_partkey,\n    sum(ps_supplycost * ps_availqty) as "value"\nfrom\n    partsupp,\n    supplier,\n    nation,\n    aggregate_value\nwhere\n    ps_suppkey = s_suppkey\n    and s_nationkey = n_nationkey\n    and n_name = \'INDIA\'\ngroup by\n    ps_partkey\nhaving\n    sum(ps_supplycost * ps_availqty) > aggregate_value.total_value * 0.0000100000\norder by\n    "value" desc\nlimit 1;\n```\n\n### Selected Query Rewrite Rules\n\n```python\n[\n    "AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE",\n    "FILTER_AGGREGATE_TRANSPOSE"\n]\n```\n\nThese rules help in merging the aggregate computation and optimizing the filter placement, leading to a more efficient query execution.', 'time': 7.86406683921814}
