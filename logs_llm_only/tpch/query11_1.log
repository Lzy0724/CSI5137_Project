inefficiencies. The query involves a join between three tables (`partsupp`, `supplier`, and `nation`), a filter condition on `n_name`, a group by operation, and a subquery in the `HAVING` clause that repeats the same join and filter logic.\n\nThe main inefficiency here is the repeated join and filter logic in the subquery. We can optimize this by eliminating the subquery and using a common table expression (CTE) or a derived table to compute the necessary aggregate once and reuse it. However, since we are limited to using the provided rewrite rules, we need to find applicable rules that can help optimize the query.\n\nUpon reviewing the available rules, the most relevant rule for this scenario is `FILTER_AGGREGATE_TRANSPOSE`, which can help push the filter condition past the aggregate operation. This can potentially reduce the number of rows processed by the aggregate function, improving performance.\n\nLet\'s apply the `FILTER_AGGREGATE_TRANSPOSE` rule to optimize the query:\n\n1. **Initial Query Analysis**:\n   - The query performs a join between `partsupp`, `supplier`, and `nation` with a filter on `n_name = \'VIETNAM\'`.\n   - It calculates the sum of `ps_supplycost * ps_availqty` grouped by `ps_partkey`.\n   - The `HAVING` clause uses a subquery to filter results based on a computed threshold.\n\n2. **Apply `FILTER_AGGREGATE_TRANSPOSE`**:\n   - This rule allows us to push the filter condition (`n_name = \'VIETNAM\'`) past the aggregate operation.\n   - By applying this rule, we can reduce the number of rows processed by the aggregate function, as only rows matching the filter condition will be aggregated.\n\n3. **Optimized Query**:\n   - After applying the rule, the query structure remains similar, but the filter condition is effectively pushed down to reduce the data processed by the aggregate function.\n\nGiven the constraints of using only the provided rules, the `FILTER_AGGREGATE_TRANSPOSE` rule is the most applicable for optimizing this query. However, note that this rule alone may not fully eliminate the inefficiency of the repeated subquery logic. In practice, further optimization might involve restructuring the query to avoid the subquery altogether, but this goes beyond the scope of the provided rules.\n\n```python\n["FILTER_AGGREGATE_TRANSPOSE"]\n```', 'time': 7.465972423553467}
