rewrite rules can be applied to improve its performance. The query involves multiple joins, a filter condition, an aggregation, and a sorting operation. Let\'s go through the query and see which rules can be applied:\n\n1. **Join Optimization**: The query involves multiple joins between tables. We should consider rules that optimize join operations, such as pushing filters into joins or removing unnecessary joins.\n\n2. **Filter Optimization**: The query has a filter condition on the `region` table. We can look for rules that push filters down to reduce the amount of data processed in joins.\n\n3. **Aggregation Optimization**: The query performs an aggregation to calculate revenue. We should consider rules that optimize aggregation operations.\n\n4. **Sort Optimization**: The query sorts the results by revenue in descending order. We should check if there are any rules that optimize sorting operations.\n\nLet\'s apply the relevant rules step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Apply `FILTER_INTO_JOIN`\n- **Reasoning**: The filter condition `r_name = \'AFRICA\'` can be pushed into the join condition to reduce the number of rows processed in the join.\n- **Transformation**: Push the filter condition into the join between `region` and `nation`.\n\n### Step 2: Apply `JOIN_CONDITION_PUSH`\n- **Reasoning**: Push join conditions into the inputs of the join to reduce the amount of data processed.\n- **Transformation**: Push join conditions like `c_custkey = o_custkey`, `l_orderkey = o_orderkey`, etc., into the respective joins.\n\n### Step 3: Apply `AGGREGATE_FILTER_TRANSPOSE`\n- **Reasoning**: Transpose the aggregate operation below the filter to reduce the number of rows aggregated.\n- **Transformation**: Move the aggregation operation below the filter condition.\n\n### Step 4: Apply `SORT_REMOVE_CONSTANT_KEYS`\n- **Reasoning**: If any sort keys are constant, they can be removed to simplify the sort operation.\n- **Transformation**: Check if any sort keys are constant and remove them if applicable.\n\nAfter applying these rules, the query should be more efficient in terms of processing fewer rows and performing operations on reduced datasets. Here is the list of selected rules in order:\n\n```python\n[\n    "FILTER_INTO_JOIN",\n    "JOIN_CONDITION_PUSH",\n    "AGGREGATE_FILTER_TRANSPOSE",\n    "SORT_REMOVE_CONSTANT_KEYS"\n]\n```', 'time': 5.766708850860596}
