rules. The query involves multiple joins, filters, and an aggregation with a `GROUP BY` clause. The goal is to improve the query\'s performance by applying appropriate rewrite rules.\n\n### Analysis of the Query:\n1. **Joins**: The query involves multiple joins between tables: `call_center`, `catalog_returns`, `date_dim`, `customer`, `customer_address`, `customer_demographics`, and `household_demographics`.\n2. **Filters**: There are several filter conditions applied in the `WHERE` clause.\n3. **Aggregation**: The query aggregates data using `SUM(cr_net_loss)` and groups by several columns.\n4. **Order By**: The results are ordered by the aggregated value `SUM(cr_net_loss)` in descending order.\n\n### Potential Optimization Steps:\n1. **Filter Pushdown**: Push filters as close to the data source as possible to reduce the amount of data processed in joins and aggregations.\n2. **Join Condition Optimization**: Ensure that join conditions are optimized to reduce the size of intermediate results.\n3. **Aggregation Optimization**: Optimize the aggregation process by reducing unnecessary computations.\n\n### Selected Rewrite Rules:\n1. **FILTER_INTO_JOIN**: This rule attempts to push filter expressions into join conditions and into the inputs of the join. This can help reduce the amount of data processed in the joins.\n2. **JOIN_CONDITION_PUSH**: This rule pushes predicates in a join into the inputs to the join, which can help in reducing the size of the join operation.\n3. **FILTER_AGGREGATE_TRANSPOSE**: This rule pushes a filter past an aggregate, which can help in reducing the data processed by the aggregation.\n\n### Applying the Selected Rules:\n1. **FILTER_INTO_JOIN**: Push the filter conditions into the join conditions to reduce the data processed by the joins.\n2. **JOIN_CONDITION_PUSH**: Further optimize the join conditions by pushing predicates into the join inputs.\n3. **FILTER_AGGREGATE_TRANSPOSE**: Push the filter conditions past the aggregation to ensure only relevant data is aggregated.\n\nBy applying these rules, we aim to reduce the amount of data processed at each stage of the query, leading to improved performance.\n\n```python\n[\n    "FILTER_INTO_JOIN",\n    "JOIN_CONDITION_PUSH",\n    "FILTER_AGGREGATE_TRANSPOSE"\n]\n```', 'time': 4.729605436325073}
