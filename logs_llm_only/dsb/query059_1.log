inefficiencies. The query involves multiple subqueries, joins, and aggregations. Let\'s break down the query and apply relevant rewrite rules to improve its performance.\n\n### Analysis of the Query:\n\n1. **Common Table Expression (CTE) `wss`:**\n   - This CTE aggregates sales data by week and store, with conditional aggregation for each day of the week.\n   - The `CASE` statements can be optimized using the `AGGREGATE_CASE_TO_FILTER` rule, which converts `CASE`-style filtered aggregates into true filtered aggregates.\n\n2. **Main Query:**\n   - The main query involves two subqueries (`y` and `x`) that join the `wss` CTE with `store` and `date_dim` tables.\n   - Both subqueries have similar structures and filter conditions, which can be optimized by merging common operations.\n   - The final selection involves joining these subqueries on `s_store_id` and `d_week_seq`.\n\n3. **Potential Optimizations:**\n   - **AGGREGATE_CASE_TO_FILTER:** Convert `CASE` statements in the `wss` CTE to filtered aggregates.\n   - **FILTER_INTO_JOIN:** Push filter conditions into the join to reduce the data processed by the join.\n   - **PROJECT_JOIN_TRANSPOSE:** Push projections past joins to reduce the amount of data processed in joins.\n   - **FILTER_MERGE:** Combine filter conditions to reduce the number of filter operations.\n\n### Applying the Rewrite Rules:\n\n1. **AGGREGATE_CASE_TO_FILTER:**\n   - Convert the `CASE` statements in the `wss` CTE to use filtered aggregates.\n\n2. **FILTER_INTO_JOIN:**\n   - Push filter conditions from the subqueries into the join conditions to reduce the data processed by the join.\n\n3. **PROJECT_JOIN_TRANSPOSE:**\n   - Push projections past joins to minimize the data processed during the join operations.\n\n4. **FILTER_MERGE:**\n   - Combine filter conditions in the subqueries to reduce the number of filter operations.\n\n### Optimized Query:\n\nAfter applying the selected rules, the optimized query would look like this:\n\n```sql\nwith wss as (\n  select d_week_seq,\n         ss_store_sk,\n         sum(ss_sales_price) filter (where d_day_name=\'Sunday\') as sun_sales,\n         sum(ss_sales_price) filter (where d_day_name=\'Monday\') as mon_sales,\n         sum(ss_sales_price) filter (where d_day_name=\'Tuesday\') as tue_sales,\n         sum(ss_sales_price) filter (where d_day_name=\'Wednesday\') as wed_sales,\n         sum(ss_sales_price) filter (where d_day_name=\'Thursday\') as thu_sales,\n         sum(ss_sales_price) filter (where d_day_name=\'Friday\') as fri_sales,\n         sum(ss_sales_price) filter (where d_day_name=\'Saturday\') as sat_sales\n  from store_sales, date_dim\n  where d_date_sk = ss_sold_date_sk\n    and ss_sales_price / ss_list_price BETWEEN 0.54 AND 0.74\n  group by d_week_seq, ss_store_sk\n)\nselect s_store_name1, s_store_id1, d_week_seq1,\n       sun_sales1/sun_sales2, mon_sales1/mon_sales2,\n       tue_sales1/tue_sales2, wed_sales1/wed_sales2, thu_sales1/thu_sales2,\n       fri_sales1/fri_sales2, sat_sales1/sat_sales2\nfrom (\n  select s_store_name as s_store_name1, wss.d_week_seq as d_week_seq1,\n         s_store_id as s_store_id1, sun_sales as sun_sales1,\n         mon_sales as mon_sales1, tue_sales as tue_sales1,\n         wed_sales as wed_sales1, thu_sales as thu_sales1,\n         fri_sales as fri_sales1, sat_sales as sat_sales1\n  from wss\n  join store on ss_store_sk = s_store_sk\n  join date_dim d on d.d_week_seq = wss.d_week_seq\n  where d_month_seq between 1192 and 1203\n    and s_state in (\'CO\',\'GA\',\'MN\',\'ND\',\'NE\',\'PA\',\'TN\',\'WI\')\n) y\njoin (\n  select s_store_name as s_store_name2, wss.d_week_seq as d_week_seq2,\n         s_store_id as s_store_id2, sun_sales as sun_sales2,\n         mon_sales as mon_sales2, tue_sales as tue_sales2,\n         wed_sales as wed_sales2, thu_sales as thu_sales2,\n         fri_sales as fri_sales2, sat_sales as sat_sales2\n  from wss\n  join store on ss_store_sk = s_store_sk\n  join date_dim d on d.d_week_seq = wss.d_week_seq\n  where d_month_seq between 1204 and 1215\n    and s_state in (\'CO\',\'GA\',\'MN\',\'ND\',\'NE\',\'PA\',\'TN\',\'WI\')\n) x on s_store_id1 = s_store_id2 and d_week_seq1 = d_week_seq2 - 52\norder by s_store_name1, s_store_id1, d_week_seq1\nlimit 100;\n```\n\n### Selected Rewrite Rules:\n\n```python\n[\n    "AGGREGATE_CASE_TO_FILTER",\n    "FILTER_INTO_JOIN",\n    "PROJECT_JOIN_TRANSPOSE",\n    "FILTER_MERGE"\n]\n```', 'time': 9.527687072753906}
