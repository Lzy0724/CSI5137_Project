inefficiencies. The query consists of two common table expressions (CTEs) `cs_ui` and `cross_sales`, followed by a final selection from a self-join on `cross_sales`. The query involves multiple joins, filters, and aggregations.\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **Joins and Filters**: The query uses implicit joins (comma-separated tables with `WHERE` conditions) which can be inefficient. Converting these to explicit `JOIN` clauses can help the optimizer better understand the join conditions and potentially reorder them for efficiency.\n\n2. **Redundant Conditions**: The `WHERE` clause in `cross_sales` contains redundant conditions, such as `cd1.cd_marital_status in (\'M\', \'M\', \'S\')`, which can be simplified.\n\n3. **Aggregation and Filtering**: The `cs_ui` CTE uses aggregation with a `HAVING` clause. The `cross_sales` CTE also involves aggregation with multiple `GROUP BY` columns.\n\n4. **Self-Join on Aggregated Data**: The final query performs a self-join on the `cross_sales` CTE, which can be expensive if `cross_sales` produces a large result set.\n\n### Optimization Strategy:\n- **Convert Implicit Joins to Explicit Joins**: This helps the optimizer understand the join conditions better.\n- **Simplify Redundant Conditions**: Remove duplicate values in `IN` clauses.\n- **Push Filters Down**: Apply filters as early as possible to reduce the data volume processed in subsequent operations.\n- **Merge Aggregations**: If possible, merge aggregations to reduce the number of operations.\n\n### Selected Rewrite Rules:\n1. **FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS**: Simplify redundant filter expressions.\n2. **FILTER_INTO_JOIN**: Push filter conditions into join conditions to reduce intermediate result sizes.\n3. **JOIN_CONDITION_PUSH**: Push predicates in a join into the inputs to the join.\n4. **AGGREGATE_FILTER_TRANSPOSE**: Push aggregates below filters where applicable.\n\nLet\'s apply these rules step by step:\n\n1. **FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS**: Simplify redundant conditions in the `WHERE` clause of `cross_sales`.\n   - Original: `cd1.cd_marital_status in (\'M\', \'M\', \'S\')`\n   - Simplified: `cd1.cd_marital_status in (\'M\', \'S\')`\n\n2. **FILTER_INTO_JOIN**: Push filter conditions into join conditions.\n   - Move conditions like `ss_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 73 AND 93` into the join condition with `store_sales`.\n\n3. **JOIN_CONDITION_PUSH**: Convert implicit joins to explicit joins and push predicates.\n   - Convert comma-separated tables to `JOIN` clauses with appropriate `ON` conditions.\n\n4. **AGGREGATE_FILTER_TRANSPOSE**: Push aggregates below filters in `cs_ui` if applicable.\n\nAfter applying these rules, the query will be more efficient by reducing the data processed at each step and allowing the optimizer to better plan the execution.\n\n```python\n[\n    "FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS",\n    "FILTER_INTO_JOIN",\n    "JOIN_CONDITION_PUSH",\n    "AGGREGATE_FILTER_TRANSPOSE"\n]\n```', 'time': 8.372579097747803}
