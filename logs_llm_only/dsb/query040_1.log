The goal is to apply the most relevant rewrite rules to improve performance.\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **CASE Statement in Aggregates**: The query uses `CASE` statements within `SUM` functions. This can be optimized using the `AGGREGATE_CASE_TO_FILTER` rule, which converts `CASE`-style filtered aggregates into true filtered aggregates. This can improve performance by simplifying the aggregation logic.\n\n2. **LEFT OUTER JOIN**: The query uses a `LEFT OUTER JOIN` between `catalog_sales` and `catalog_returns`. If the join is not necessary for the aggregation or filtering, it can be removed using the `AGGREGATE_JOIN_REMOVE` rule. However, in this case, the join is necessary for the calculation of `sales_before` and `sales_after`.\n\n3. **Filter Conditions**: The query has several filter conditions in the `WHERE` clause. The `FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS` rule can be applied to reduce constants inside the filter, but the current filters are already optimized with direct comparisons and range checks.\n\n4. **Join Conditions**: The `JOIN_CONDITION_PUSH` rule can be used to push predicates in a join into the inputs to the join, but the current join conditions are already optimized.\n\n5. **Order By and Limit**: The `ORDER BY` clause is followed by a `LIMIT`. If the input is already sorted, the `SORT_REMOVE` rule can remove unnecessary sorting. However, the query requires sorting by `w_state` and `i_item_id`, which is necessary for the result.\n\n### Selected Rules:\nBased on the analysis, the most relevant rule to apply is `AGGREGATE_CASE_TO_FILTER` to optimize the `CASE` statements within the `SUM` aggregates.\n\n### Transformation Steps:\n1. **Apply AGGREGATE_CASE_TO_FILTER**: Convert the `CASE` statements within the `SUM` functions to use filtered aggregates.\n\n   Original:\n   ```sql\n   sum(case when (cast(d_date as date) < cast (\'1999-04-19\' as date))\n       then cs_sales_price - coalesce(cr_refunded_cash,0) else 0 end) as sales_before\n   ```\n\n   Transformed:\n   ```sql\n   sum(cs_sales_price - coalesce(cr_refunded_cash,0)) filter (where cast(d_date as date) < cast (\'1999-04-19\' as date)) as sales_before\n   ```\n\n   Similarly, transform `sales_after` using the same approach.\n\n### Final Optimized Query:\n```sql\nselect \n   w_state\n  ,i_item_id\n  ,sum(cs_sales_price - coalesce(cr_refunded_cash,0)) filter (where cast(d_date as date) < cast (\'1999-04-19\' as date)) as sales_before\n  ,sum(cs_sales_price - coalesce(cr_refunded_cash,0)) filter (where cast(d_date as date) >= cast (\'1999-04-19\' as date)) as sales_after\n from\n   catalog_sales left outer join catalog_returns on\n       (cs_order_number = cr_order_number\n        and cs_item_sk = cr_item_sk)\n  ,warehouse\n  ,item\n  ,date_dim\n where\n i_item_sk          = cs_item_sk\n and cs_warehouse_sk    = w_warehouse_sk\n and cs_sold_date_sk    = d_date_sk\n and d_date between  (cast (\'1999-04-19\' as date) - interval \'30\' day)\n                and (cast (\'1999-04-19\' as date) + interval \'30\' day) \n and i_category  = \'Sports\'\n and i_manager_id between 61 and 100\n and cs_wholesale_cost between 13 and 32\n and cr_reason_sk = 57\n group by\n    w_state,i_item_id\n order by w_state,i_item_id\nlimit 100;\n```\n\n### Selected Rules List:\n```python\n["AGGREGATE_CASE_TO_FILTER"]\n```', 'time': 9.702938556671143}
