inefficiencies. The query involves multiple tables joined together, a WHERE clause with several conditions, and a GROUP BY clause with aggregate functions using CASE statements. The goal is to apply rewrite rules that can improve the performance of this query.\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **Joins and Filters**: The query uses implicit joins (comma-separated tables) and filters in the WHERE clause. These can be optimized by ensuring that filters are pushed down as much as possible to reduce the data processed by joins.\n2. **Aggregate Functions**: The query uses CASE statements within aggregate functions. These can be optimized by converting them into filtered aggregates.\n3. **Order of Operations**: The query uses a GROUP BY clause followed by an ORDER BY clause. Ensuring that sorting is done efficiently is crucial.\n\n### Applicable Rewrite Rules:\n1. **AGGREGATE_CASE_TO_FILTER**: This rule converts CASE-style filtered aggregates into true filtered aggregates, which can be more efficient.\n2. **FILTER_INTO_JOIN**: This rule tries to push filter expressions into join conditions, which can reduce the amount of data processed by the join.\n3. **FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS**: This rule reduces constants inside a LogicalFilter, which can simplify the query.\n\n### Optimization Steps:\n1. **Apply AGGREGATE_CASE_TO_FILTER**: Convert the CASE statements within the SUM functions into filtered aggregates. This can improve the performance by allowing the database engine to optimize the aggregation process.\n2. **Apply FILTER_INTO_JOIN**: Push the filter conditions into the join conditions to reduce the data processed by the joins.\n3. **Apply FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS**: Simplify the filter expressions by reducing constants, which can lead to a more efficient execution plan.\n\n### Transformed Query:\n1. **AGGREGATE_CASE_TO_FILTER**:\n   ```sql\n   select \n      substring(w_warehouse_name,1,20),\n      sm_type,\n      cc_name,\n      sum(cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk <= 30) as "30 days",\n      sum(cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk > 30 and cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk <= 60) as "31-60 days",\n      sum(cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk > 60 and cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk <= 90) as "61-90 days",\n      sum(cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk > 90 and cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk <= 120) as "91-120 days",\n      sum(cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk > 120) as ">120 days"\n   from\n      catalog_sales,\n      warehouse,\n      ship_mode,\n      call_center,\n      date_dim\n   where\n      d_month_seq between 1212 and 1212 + 23\n      and cs_ship_date_sk = d_date_sk\n      and cs_warehouse_sk = w_warehouse_sk\n      and cs_ship_mode_sk = sm_ship_mode_sk\n      and cs_call_center_sk = cc_call_center_sk\n      and cs_list_price between 13 and 42\n      and sm_type = \'EXPRESS\'\n      and cc_class = \'small\'\n      and w_gmt_offset = -5\n   group by\n      substring(w_warehouse_name,1,20),\n      sm_type,\n      cc_name\n   order by substring(w_warehouse_name,1,20),\n            sm_type,\n            cc_name\n   limit 100;\n   ```\n\n2. **FILTER_INTO_JOIN**: Push filter conditions into join conditions (not explicitly shown in SQL, but assumed in execution plan).\n\n3. **FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS**: Simplify filter expressions (not explicitly shown in SQL, but assumed in execution plan).\n\n### Conclusion:\nBy applying these rules, the query is optimized to reduce the amount of data processed and improve the efficiency of aggregate calculations.\n\n```python\n[\n    "AGGREGATE_CASE_TO_FILTER",\n    "FILTER_INTO_JOIN",\n    "FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS"\n]\n```', 'time': 8.912449359893799}
