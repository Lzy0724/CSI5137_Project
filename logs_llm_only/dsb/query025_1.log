inefficiencies. The query involves multiple joins and filters, and it aggregates data from several tables. The goal is to apply rewrite rules that can simplify the query, reduce the number of operations, or push operations closer to the data source to improve performance.\n\n### Analysis of the Query:\n1. **Joins and Filters**: The query involves several joins between `store_sales`, `store_returns`, `catalog_sales`, `date_dim`, `store`, and `item`. The filters on `date_dim` are specific and can potentially be pushed down to reduce the data early in the execution plan.\n\n2. **Aggregations**: The query performs aggregations using `MAX` functions. These aggregations are grouped by item and store attributes.\n\n3. **Order and Limit**: The query orders the results by item and store attributes and limits the output to 100 rows.\n\n### Potential Optimization Steps:\n1. **Filter Pushdown**: Push filters closer to the data source to reduce the amount of data processed in joins and aggregations.\n2. **Join Condition Optimization**: Optimize join conditions to ensure they are as efficient as possible.\n3. **Aggregation Optimization**: Ensure aggregations are performed efficiently, possibly by reducing the data set before aggregation.\n\n### Selected Rewrite Rules:\n- **FILTER_INTO_JOIN**: This rule attempts to push filter expressions into join conditions and into the inputs of the join. This can help reduce the data set early in the query execution.\n- **JOIN_CONDITION_PUSH**: This rule pushes predicates in a join into the inputs to the join, which can help optimize the join operation.\n- **FILTER_AGGREGATE_TRANSPOSE**: This rule pushes a filter past an aggregate, which can help reduce the data set before aggregation.\n\n### Applying the Selected Rules:\n\n1. **FILTER_INTO_JOIN**:\n   - Push the filter conditions on `date_dim` (`d1.d_moy = 4` and `d1.d_year = 2001`) into the join conditions with `store_sales`, `store_returns`, and `catalog_sales`.\n\n2. **JOIN_CONDITION_PUSH**:\n   - Push join conditions such as `ss_customer_sk = sr_customer_sk` and `ss_item_sk = sr_item_sk` into the respective tables to ensure they are applied as early as possible.\n\n3. **FILTER_AGGREGATE_TRANSPOSE**:\n   - Push any remaining filters past the aggregation step to ensure that only relevant data is aggregated.\n\nBy applying these rules, we can potentially reduce the data set size early in the query execution, optimize join operations, and ensure efficient aggregation.\n\n```python\n[\n    "FILTER_INTO_JOIN",\n    "JOIN_CONDITION_PUSH",\n    "FILTER_AGGREGATE_TRANSPOSE"\n]\n```', 'time': 6.753583669662476}
