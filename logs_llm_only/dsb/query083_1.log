inefficiencies. The query consists of three common table expressions (CTEs) that perform similar operations on different tables (`store_returns`, `catalog_returns`, `web_returns`) and then join the results. The query also includes subqueries within the `WHERE` clause that could potentially be optimized.\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **Subquery Optimization**: The subqueries in the `WHERE` clause are identical across the CTEs. These subqueries can be optimized by reducing redundancy.\n2. **Join Optimization**: The final `SELECT` statement joins the three CTEs on `item_id`. Ensuring that these joins are efficient is crucial.\n3. **Filter and Aggregate Optimization**: The query applies several filters and aggregates. Ensuring these operations are efficiently ordered can improve performance.\n\n### Applicable Rules:\n1. **FILTER_INTO_JOIN**: This rule can push filter expressions into the join condition, potentially reducing the number of rows processed in the join.\n2. **FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS**: This rule can reduce constants inside a filter, which might help in simplifying the subqueries.\n3. **AGGREGATE_FILTER_TRANSPOSE**: This rule can transpose aggregates and filters, potentially allowing for more efficient filtering before aggregation.\n\n### Optimization Steps:\n1. **Apply FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS**: Simplify the subqueries by reducing constants and potentially merging them.\n2. **Apply FILTER_INTO_JOIN**: Push filter conditions into the join to reduce the number of rows processed.\n3. **Apply AGGREGATE_FILTER_TRANSPOSE**: Transpose aggregates and filters to ensure filtering happens before aggregation where possible.\n\nLet\'s apply these rules step by step:\n\n1. **FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS**:\n   - Simplify the subqueries in the `WHERE` clause by reducing constants. This involves evaluating the subqueries to see if they can be simplified or merged.\n\n2. **FILTER_INTO_JOIN**:\n   - Push the filter conditions related to `i_category`, `i_manager_id`, and `sr_reason_sk` into the join conditions of the CTEs. This reduces the number of rows processed in the joins.\n\n3. **AGGREGATE_FILTER_TRANSPOSE**:\n   - Transpose the aggregates and filters in the CTEs to ensure that filtering occurs before aggregation, reducing the number of rows that need to be aggregated.\n\nBy applying these rules, we can optimize the query to improve its performance.\n\n```python\n[\n    "FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS",\n    "FILTER_INTO_JOIN",\n    "AGGREGATE_FILTER_TRANSPOSE"\n]\n```', 'time': 6.4115118980407715}
