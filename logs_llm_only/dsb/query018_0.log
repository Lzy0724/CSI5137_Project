inefficiencies. The query involves multiple joins, filtering conditions, and aggregation with a `ROLLUP`. Let\'s consider the rules provided and see which ones can be applied to improve the query\'s performance.\n\n### Analysis of the Query:\n1. **Joins**: The query involves multiple joins between tables `catalog_sales`, `customer_demographics`, `customer`, `customer_address`, `date_dim`, and `item`. These joins are necessary for the query logic, but we should ensure they are optimized.\n2. **Filters**: There are several filtering conditions applied in the `WHERE` clause. These filters should ideally be pushed down to reduce the data volume early in the execution plan.\n3. **Aggregation**: The query uses `ROLLUP` for aggregation, which is a complex operation. We should check if any rules can simplify or optimize this aggregation.\n4. **Order By and Limit**: The query orders the results and limits them to 100 rows. Sorting can be expensive, so we should ensure it\'s done efficiently.\n\n### Applicable Rules:\n- **FILTER_INTO_JOIN**: This rule can push filter expressions into the join condition, potentially reducing the data volume early.\n- **JOIN_CONDITION_PUSH**: This rule can push predicates in a join into the inputs, which can help in reducing the data processed by the join.\n- **FILTER_AGGREGATE_TRANSPOSE**: This rule can push filters past an aggregate, which might help in reducing the data before aggregation.\n- **SORT_REMOVE_CONSTANT_KEYS**: If any sort keys are constant, this rule can remove them, potentially simplifying the sort operation.\n\n### Selected Rules and Transformation Steps:\n1. **FILTER_INTO_JOIN**: Push filter conditions into the join to reduce the data volume early.\n2. **JOIN_CONDITION_PUSH**: Further optimize joins by pushing predicates into the join inputs.\n3. **FILTER_AGGREGATE_TRANSPOSE**: Push filters past the aggregation to reduce the data before aggregation.\n4. **SORT_REMOVE_CONSTANT_KEYS**: Check if any sort keys are constant and remove them if possible.\n\nLet\'s apply these rules step by step:\n\n1. **FILTER_INTO_JOIN**:\n   - Push filters like `cd_gender = \'F\'`, `cd_education_status = \'2 yr Degree\'`, `d_year = 2000`, `c_birth_month = 3`, `ca_state in (\'GA\', \'ME\', \'NC\')`, `cs_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 84 AND 89`, and `i_category = \'Books\'` into the respective join conditions.\n\n2. **JOIN_CONDITION_PUSH**:\n   - Push join predicates such as `cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk`, `cs_item_sk = i_item_sk`, `cs_bill_cdemo_sk = cd_demo_sk`, `cs_bill_customer_sk = c_customer_sk`, and `c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk` into the join inputs to optimize the join operations.\n\n3. **FILTER_AGGREGATE_TRANSPOSE**:\n   - Push any remaining filters past the aggregation to ensure that only necessary data is aggregated.\n\n4. **SORT_REMOVE_CONSTANT_KEYS**:\n   - Check the `ORDER BY` clause for constant keys. In this case, the keys are not constant, so this rule may not apply directly, but it\'s good to verify.\n\nAfter applying these rules, the query should be more efficient by reducing the data volume early and optimizing join operations.\n\n### Final Output:\n```python\n[\n    "FILTER_INTO_JOIN",\n    "JOIN_CONDITION_PUSH",\n    "FILTER_AGGREGATE_TRANSPOSE",\n    "SORT_REMOVE_CONSTANT_KEYS"\n]\n```', 'time': 8.279918193817139}
