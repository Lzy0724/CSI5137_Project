inefficiencies. The query involves multiple joins, a filter condition, an aggregation, and an ordering with a limit. Let\'s break down the query and see which rules can be applied to optimize it.\n\n### Analysis of the Query:\n1. **Joins**: The query involves multiple joins between tables `date_dim`, `store_sales`, `item`, `customer`, `customer_address`, and `store`. These joins are necessary for the query logic, but we should ensure they are as efficient as possible.\n2. **Filters**: There are several filter conditions applied in the `WHERE` clause. These filters should be pushed down as much as possible to reduce the data processed in subsequent operations.\n3. **Aggregation**: The query aggregates sales data by brand and manufacturer, summing up the `ss_ext_sales_price`.\n4. **Ordering and Limiting**: The results are ordered by `ext_price` in descending order and limited to 100 rows.\n\n### Potential Optimization Rules:\n- **FILTER_INTO_JOIN**: This rule can push filter expressions into the join condition, potentially reducing the number of rows processed in the join.\n- **JOIN_CONDITION_PUSH**: This rule can push predicates in a join into the inputs to the join, which can help in reducing the data size before the join operation.\n- **FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS**: This rule can reduce constants inside a filter, simplifying the filter conditions.\n- **SORT_REMOVE**: If the input to the sort operation is already sorted, this rule can remove the sort operation. However, in this case, the sort is necessary due to the `ORDER BY` clause.\n\n### Selected Rules:\n1. **FILTER_INTO_JOIN**: Push filter conditions into the join to reduce the data size early.\n2. **JOIN_CONDITION_PUSH**: Further optimize join conditions by pushing predicates into the join inputs.\n3. **FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS**: Simplify filter conditions where possible.\n\n### Transformation Steps:\n1. **Apply FILTER_INTO_JOIN**: Push the filter conditions such as `i_category = \'Sports\'`, `d_year = 1999`, `d_moy = 3`, `ca_state = \'OK\'`, `c_birth_month = 11`, and `ss_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 71 AND 91` into the respective join conditions. This reduces the number of rows processed in the joins.\n2. **Apply JOIN_CONDITION_PUSH**: Push join predicates into the inputs of the join to further reduce the data size before the join operation.\n3. **Apply FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS**: Simplify any constant expressions in the filter conditions.\n\nBy applying these rules, we aim to reduce the amount of data processed in the joins and filters, leading to a more efficient query execution.\n\n```python\n[\n    "FILTER_INTO_JOIN",\n    "JOIN_CONDITION_PUSH",\n    "FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS"\n]\n```', 'time': 6.147748947143555}
