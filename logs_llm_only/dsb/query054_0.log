inefficiencies. The query involves multiple common table expressions (CTEs) and joins, which can be optimized using the provided rewrite rules. Let\'s break down the query and apply the most suitable rules:\n\n1. **CTE `my_customers`:** This CTE uses a `DISTINCT` clause on a union of two subqueries. The `AGGREGATE_REMOVE` rule can be applied here because the `DISTINCT` operation is essentially an aggregate operation without any aggregate functions. This rule will remove the `DISTINCT` if the underlying relational expression is already distinct.\n\n2. **CTE `my_revenue`:** This CTE performs a `GROUP BY` operation. The `AGGREGATE_FILTER_TRANSPOSE` rule can be applied to push the `GROUP BY` operation below the filter conditions, potentially reducing the number of rows before aggregation.\n\n3. **CTE `segments`:** This CTE calculates a derived column `segment` based on the `revenue`. There are no direct optimizations applicable here from the provided rules.\n\n4. **Final SELECT:** The final query performs a `GROUP BY` and `ORDER BY` operation. The `SORT_REMOVE` rule can be applied if the input is already sorted, but in this case, it is not applicable as the input is not guaranteed to be sorted.\n\nBased on the analysis, the following rules can be applied to optimize the query:\n\n1. **AGGREGATE_REMOVE**: Remove the `DISTINCT` operation in `my_customers` if possible.\n2. **AGGREGATE_FILTER_TRANSPOSE**: Push the `GROUP BY` operation in `my_revenue` below the filter conditions.\n\nLet\'s apply these rules step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Apply AGGREGATE_REMOVE to `my_customers`\n\nThe `DISTINCT` operation in `my_customers` can be removed if the underlying union of `catalog_sales` and `web_sales` is already distinct. However, since the union is `UNION ALL`, which does not remove duplicates, we cannot apply this rule directly. Therefore, this step does not result in any change.\n\n### Step 2: Apply AGGREGATE_FILTER_TRANSPOSE to `my_revenue`\n\nBefore:\n```sql\nselect c_customer_sk,\n       sum(ss_ext_sales_price) as revenue\nfrom   my_customers,\n       store_sales,\n       customer_address,\n       store,\n       date_dim\nwhere  c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk\n       and ca_county = s_county\n       and ca_state = s_state\n       and ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk\n       and c_customer_sk = ss_customer_sk\n       and ss_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 70 AND 100\n       and s_state in (\'GA\',\'IA\',\'IL\'\n                   ,\'KS\',\'LA\',\'ME\'\n                   ,\'MI\',\'NC\',\'ND\'\n                   ,\'OK\')\n       and d_month_seq between (select distinct d_month_seq+1\n                                from   date_dim where d_year = 1999 and d_moy = 12)\n                          and  (select distinct d_month_seq+3\n                                from   date_dim where d_year = 1999 and d_moy = 12)\ngroup by c_customer_sk\n```\n\nAfter applying `AGGREGATE_FILTER_TRANSPOSE`, the filter conditions are pushed below the `GROUP BY` operation, potentially reducing the number of rows before aggregation. However, this transformation is more conceptual and depends on the database optimizer\'s ability to execute it efficiently. The SQL syntax remains unchanged, but the execution plan may be optimized.\n\n### Final Optimized Query\n\nThe query remains largely unchanged in syntax, but the application of the `AGGREGATE_FILTER_TRANSPOSE` rule may lead to a more efficient execution plan by reducing the number of rows processed in the `GROUP BY` operation.\n\n```python\n[\n    "AGGREGATE_FILTER_TRANSPOSE"\n]\n```\n\nIn conclusion, the primary optimization comes from the potential execution plan improvement by applying `AGGREGATE_FILTER_TRANSPOSE`. The `AGGREGATE_REMOVE` rule was considered but not applicable due to the nature of the `UNION ALL` operation.', 'time': 9.366795063018799}
