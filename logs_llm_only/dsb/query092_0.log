WINDOW_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS:\n"""Rule that reduces constants inside a LogicalWindow."""'}], 'response': 'To optimize the given SQL query, we need to analyze the query structure and identify potential inefficiencies. The query involves a join between three tables (`web_sales`, `item`, and `date_dim`) and a subquery that calculates an average. The main query filters and aggregates data, and the subquery is used to filter rows based on a calculated threshold.\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **Joins and Filters**: The query uses implicit joins (comma-separated tables in the `FROM` clause) and filters in the `WHERE` clause. We can optimize by ensuring that filters are pushed down as much as possible to reduce the data processed in joins.\n\n2. **Subquery**: The subquery calculates an average and is used in a filter condition. This subquery is correlated with the main query through `ws_item_sk`.\n\n3. **Order By and Limit**: The query orders the results by the sum of `ws_ext_discount_amt` and limits the output to 100 rows. If the input to the `ORDER BY` is already sorted, the sort operation can be removed.\n\n### Optimization Steps:\n1. **FILTER_INTO_JOIN**: Push filter conditions into the join to reduce the number of rows processed early in the query execution.\n\n2. **JOIN_CONDITION_PUSH**: Push join conditions into the inputs of the join to further reduce the data processed.\n\n3. **FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE**: Convert the subquery into a correlate to optimize the execution plan by potentially reducing the number of times the subquery is executed.\n\n4. **SORT_REMOVE**: If the input to the `ORDER BY` clause is already sorted, remove the sort operation to save computation.\n\n### Applying the Rules:\n1. **FILTER_INTO_JOIN**: Push the filter conditions such as `i_manufact_id BETWEEN 517 and 716`, `i_category IN (\'Books\', \'Jewelry\', \'Shoes\')`, `d_date between \'2002-01-25\' and cast(\'2002-01-25\' as date) + interval \'90\' day`, and `ws_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 71 AND 91` into the join conditions.\n\n2. **JOIN_CONDITION_PUSH**: Ensure that join conditions like `i_item_sk = ws_item_sk` and `d_date_sk = ws_sold_date_sk` are pushed into the respective tables to minimize the data processed.\n\n3. **FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE**: Transform the subquery into a correlate to optimize its execution.\n\n4. **SORT_REMOVE**: Check if the input to the `ORDER BY` is already sorted. If so, remove the sort operation.\n\nBy applying these rules, we can optimize the query to execute more efficiently.\n\n```python\n[\n    "FILTER_INTO_JOIN",\n    "JOIN_CONDITION_PUSH",\n    "FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE",\n    "SORT_REMOVE"\n]\n```', 'time': 5.254823207855225}
