The query involves a common table expression (CTE), multiple joins, filters, and an order by clause with a limit. Let\'s break down the query and see which rewrite rules can be applied to improve its performance.\n\n### Analysis of the Query:\n\n1. **Common Table Expression (CTE):** \n   - The CTE `customer_total_return` aggregates data from `store_returns` and `date_dim` tables. It filters data based on `d_year = 2002` and a range condition on `sr_return_amt / sr_return_quantity`.\n   - The CTE is used twice: once in the main query and once in a subquery to calculate an average.\n\n2. **Joins and Filters:**\n   - The main query joins the CTE with `store`, `customer`, and `customer_demographics` tables.\n   - There are multiple filter conditions applied after the joins.\n\n3. **Subquery:**\n   - The subquery calculates an average of `ctr_total_return` for the same store and multiplies it by 1.2.\n\n4. **Order By and Limit:**\n   - The result is ordered by `c_customer_id` and limited to 100 rows.\n\n### Potential Optimizations:\n\n1. **Filter Pushdown:**\n   - Push filters as close to the data source as possible to reduce the amount of data processed in joins and aggregations.\n\n2. **Join Condition Optimization:**\n   - Ensure that join conditions are optimal and push predicates into joins where possible.\n\n3. **Subquery Optimization:**\n   - Consider rewriting the subquery to avoid recalculating aggregates multiple times.\n\n### Selected Rewrite Rules:\n\n1. **FILTER_INTO_JOIN:** Push filter expressions into join conditions to reduce the data processed in joins.\n2. **JOIN_CONDITION_PUSH:** Push predicates in a join into the inputs to the join to optimize join processing.\n3. **FILTER_AGGREGATE_TRANSPOSE:** Push filters past aggregates to reduce the data processed in aggregations.\n\n### Step-by-Step Optimization:\n\n1. **Apply FILTER_INTO_JOIN:**\n   - Push filters such as `s_state IN (\'GA\', \'IL\', \'KY\')` and `cd_marital_status IN (\'D\', \'M\')` into the join conditions to reduce the data processed in the joins.\n\n2. **Apply JOIN_CONDITION_PUSH:**\n   - Push join predicates like `ctr1.ctr_customer_sk = c_customer_sk` and `c_current_cdemo_sk = cd_demo_sk` into the respective tables to optimize join processing.\n\n3. **Apply FILTER_AGGREGATE_TRANSPOSE:**\n   - Push filters like `ctr1.ctr_total_return > (select avg(ctr_total_return)*1.2 ...)` past the aggregate in the CTE to reduce the data processed in the aggregation.\n\nBy applying these rules, we can optimize the query to process less data in joins and aggregations, improving overall performance.\n\n```python\n[\n    "FILTER_INTO_JOIN",\n    "JOIN_CONDITION_PUSH",\n    "FILTER_AGGREGATE_TRANSPOSE"\n]\n```', 'time': 8.423118829727173}
