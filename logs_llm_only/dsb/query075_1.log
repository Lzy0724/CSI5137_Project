inefficiencies. The query involves a common table expression (CTE) `all_sales` that aggregates sales data from three different sales tables (`catalog_sales`, `store_sales`, `web_sales`) and their corresponding returns tables. The CTE is then used to compare sales data between two consecutive years.\n\n### Observations:\n1. **UNION Usage**: The query uses `UNION` to combine results from three different sales sources. Since the query does not specify `UNION ALL`, it implies that duplicate rows are removed, which can be costly if there are no duplicates.\n2. **Filters and Joins**: The query has several joins and filters that can potentially be optimized by pushing filters down to reduce the data processed by joins.\n3. **Aggregation**: The query aggregates data in the CTE and then performs further operations on the aggregated data.\n\n### Potential Optimizations:\n1. **UNION to UNION ALL**: If we are certain that there are no duplicates across the three sales sources, or if duplicates are acceptable, we can replace `UNION` with `UNION ALL` to avoid the overhead of duplicate elimination.\n2. **Filter Pushdown**: Push filters as close to the data source as possible to reduce the amount of data processed in joins and aggregations.\n3. **Join Condition Optimization**: Ensure that join conditions are optimal and consider pushing predicates into join conditions where applicable.\n\n### Selected Rewrite Rules:\n1. **FILTER_INTO_JOIN**: This rule attempts to push filter expressions into join conditions and into the inputs of the join. This can help reduce the amount of data processed by the join.\n2. **UNION_REMOVE**: If any of the UNION inputs is redundant (e.g., always empty or duplicates are not a concern), this rule can help remove unnecessary UNION operations.\n3. **FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS**: This rule reduces constants inside a LogicalFilter, which can simplify and optimize filter conditions.\n\n### Applying the Rules:\n1. **FILTER_INTO_JOIN**: Push the filter conditions from the WHERE clause into the join conditions in the subqueries. This can help reduce the data size before the join operation.\n2. **UNION_REMOVE**: Analyze if any of the UNION inputs can be removed or if `UNION ALL` can be used instead of `UNION` to avoid duplicate elimination overhead.\n3. **FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS**: Simplify filter expressions, such as constant arithmetic operations, to reduce computational overhead.\n\n### Optimized Query:\n```sql\nWITH all_sales AS (\n SELECT d_year\n       ,i_brand_id\n       ,i_class_id\n       ,i_category_id\n       ,i_manufact_id\n       ,SUM(sales_cnt) AS sales_cnt\n       ,SUM(sales_amt) AS sales_amt\n FROM (SELECT d_year\n             ,i_brand_id\n             ,i_class_id\n             ,i_category_id\n             ,i_manufact_id\n             ,cs_quantity - COALESCE(cr_return_quantity,0) AS sales_cnt\n             ,cs_ext_sales_price - COALESCE(cr_return_amount,0.0) AS sales_amt\n       FROM catalog_sales \n       JOIN item ON i_item_sk=cs_item_sk\n       JOIN date_dim ON d_date_sk=cs_sold_date_sk\n       LEFT JOIN catalog_returns ON (cs_order_number=cr_order_number AND cs_item_sk=cr_item_sk)\n       WHERE i_category=\'Children\'\n       AND cs_sales_price / cs_list_price BETWEEN 0.8 AND 1.0\n       AND cr_reason_sk in (18, 40, 48, 55, 68)\n       UNION ALL\n       SELECT d_year\n             ,i_brand_id\n             ,i_class_id\n             ,i_category_id\n             ,i_manufact_id\n             ,ss_quantity - COALESCE(sr_return_quantity,0) AS sales_cnt\n             ,ss_ext_sales_price - COALESCE(sr_return_amt,0.0) AS sales_amt\n       FROM store_sales \n       JOIN item ON i_item_sk=ss_item_sk\n       JOIN date_dim ON d_date_sk=ss_sold_date_sk\n       LEFT JOIN store_returns ON (ss_ticket_number=sr_ticket_number AND ss_item_sk=sr_item_sk)\n       WHERE i_category=\'Children\'\n       AND ss_sales_price / ss_list_price BETWEEN 0.8 AND 1.0\n       AND sr_reason_sk in (18, 40, 48, 55, 68)\n       UNION ALL\n       SELECT d_year\n             ,i_brand_id\n             ,i_class_id\n             ,i_category_id\n             ,i_manufact_id\n             ,ws_quantity - COALESCE(wr_return_quantity,0) AS sales_cnt\n             ,ws_ext_sales_price - COALESCE(wr_return_amt,0.0) AS sales_amt\n       FROM web_sales \n       JOIN item ON i_item_sk=ws_item_sk\n       JOIN date_dim ON d_date_sk=ws_sold_date_sk\n       LEFT JOIN web_returns ON (ws_order_number=wr_order_number AND ws_item_sk=wr_item_sk)\n       WHERE i_category=\'Children\'\n       AND ws_sales_price / ws_list_price BETWEEN 0.8 AND 1.0\n       AND wr_reason_sk in (18, 40, 48, 55, 68)) sales_detail\nGROUP BY d_year, i_brand_id, i_class_id, i_category_id, i_manufact_id)\n SELECT  prev_yr.d_year AS prev_year\n                          ,curr_yr.d_year AS "year"\n                          ,curr_yr.i_brand_id\n                          ,curr_yr.i_class_id\n                          ,curr_yr.i_category_id\n                          ,curr_yr.i_manufact_id\n                          ,prev_yr.sales_cnt AS prev_yr_cnt\n                          ,curr_yr.sales_cnt AS curr_yr_cnt\n                          ,curr_yr.sales_cnt-prev_yr.sales_cnt AS sales_cnt_diff\n                          ,curr_yr.sales_amt-prev_yr.sales_amt AS sales_amt_diff\n FROM all_sales curr_yr, all_sales prev_yr\n WHERE curr_yr.i_brand_id=prev_yr.i_brand_id\n   AND curr_yr.i_class_id=prev_yr.i_class_id\n   AND curr_yr.i_category_id=prev_yr.i_category_id\n   AND curr_yr.i_manufact_id=prev_yr.i_manufact_id\n   AND curr_yr.d_year=1999\n   AND prev_yr.d_year=1998\n   AND prev_yr.sales_cnt > 0\n   AND CAST(curr_yr.sales_cnt AS DECIMAL(17,2))/CAST(prev_yr.sales_cnt AS DECIMAL(17,2))<0.9\n ORDER BY sales_cnt_diff,sales_amt_diff\n limit 100;\n```\n\n### Selected Rules:\n```python\n[\n    "FILTER_INTO_JOIN",\n    "UNION_REMOVE",\n    "FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS"\n]\n```', 'time': 10.561174392700195}
