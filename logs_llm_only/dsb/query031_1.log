inefficiencies. The query uses common table expressions (CTEs) `ss` and `ws` to aggregate sales data from `store_sales` and `web_sales`, respectively. The main query then joins these CTEs multiple times to calculate sales increases across different quarters.\n\n### Observations:\n1. **Redundant Joins**: The main query joins the `ss` and `ws` CTEs multiple times for different quarters. This can be optimized by restructuring the query to avoid repeated joins.\n2. **Filter Conditions**: The query applies several filter conditions that can potentially be pushed down to improve performance.\n3. **Aggregate Functions**: The query uses aggregate functions, which can be optimized by merging or reducing them if possible.\n\n### Applicable Rules:\n1. **FILTER_INTO_JOIN**: This rule can push filter expressions into join conditions, potentially reducing the number of rows processed in the joins.\n2. **FILTER_AGGREGATE_TRANSPOSE**: This rule can push filters past aggregates, which might help in reducing the data size before aggregation.\n3. **AGGREGATE_MERGE**: This rule can merge aggregates if the group keys allow it, reducing the complexity of the query.\n4. **JOIN_CONDITION_PUSH**: This rule can push join conditions into the inputs of the join, potentially reducing the data size before the join operation.\n\n### Optimization Steps:\n1. **Push Filters into Joins**: Use `FILTER_INTO_JOIN` to push filter conditions into the join operations in the CTEs `ss` and `ws`.\n2. **Transpose Filters and Aggregates**: Apply `FILTER_AGGREGATE_TRANSPOSE` to push filters past aggregates in the CTEs.\n3. **Merge Aggregates**: Use `AGGREGATE_MERGE` to merge any possible aggregates in the CTEs.\n4. **Push Join Conditions**: Apply `JOIN_CONDITION_PUSH` to push join conditions into the inputs of the join in the main query.\n\nBy applying these rules, we can potentially reduce the number of rows processed at each stage of the query, leading to improved performance.\n\n```python\n[\n    "FILTER_INTO_JOIN",\n    "FILTER_AGGREGATE_TRANSPOSE",\n    "AGGREGATE_MERGE",\n    "JOIN_CONDITION_PUSH"\n]\n```', 'time': 6.292634725570679}
