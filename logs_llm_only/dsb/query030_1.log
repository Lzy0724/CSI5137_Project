inefficiencies. The query involves a common table expression (CTE) `customer_total_return`, which aggregates data from multiple tables, and then uses this CTE in a main query that filters and orders the results.\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **Joins and Filters**: The query involves multiple joins and filters. Efficiently pushing filters into joins can reduce the amount of data processed.\n2. **Aggregation**: The CTE performs aggregation. Ensuring that filters are applied before aggregation can improve performance.\n3. **Subquery**: The main query contains a subquery that calculates an average. Optimizing subqueries can significantly impact performance.\n4. **Order and Limit**: The query orders the results and limits the output to 100 rows. Ensuring that sorting is done on a reduced dataset can improve efficiency.\n\n### Potential Optimizations:\n1. **FILTER_INTO_JOIN**: This rule can push filter conditions into join conditions, potentially reducing the number of rows processed in joins.\n2. **FILTER_AGGREGATE_TRANSPOSE**: This rule can push filters past aggregates, ensuring that only necessary data is aggregated.\n3. **JOIN_CONDITION_PUSH**: This rule can push predicates in a join into the inputs, reducing the data processed by the join.\n4. **SORT_REMOVE**: If the input to the sort is already sorted, this rule can remove the sort operation.\n\n### Selected Rules:\nBased on the analysis, the following rules are selected to optimize the query:\n\n1. **FILTER_INTO_JOIN**: Pushes filter conditions into join conditions.\n2. **FILTER_AGGREGATE_TRANSPOSE**: Pushes filters past aggregates.\n3. **JOIN_CONDITION_PUSH**: Pushes predicates in a join into the inputs.\n\n### Transformation Steps:\n1. **Apply FILTER_INTO_JOIN**: Push the filter conditions `ca_state in (\'IL\', \'NE\', \'PA\', \'VT\')` and `ctr1.ctr_reason_sk in (23, 38)` into the join conditions in both the CTE and the main query.\n2. **Apply FILTER_AGGREGATE_TRANSPOSE**: Push the filter `d_year = 2000` before the aggregation in the CTE.\n3. **Apply JOIN_CONDITION_PUSH**: Push join predicates such as `wr_returned_date_sk = d_date_sk` and `wr_returning_addr_sk = ca_address_sk` into the respective tables to reduce the data processed by the join.\n\n### Optimized Query:\nAfter applying the selected rules, the query is transformed to ensure filters are applied early, and joins process reduced datasets. The exact SQL transformation would depend on the database optimizer\'s capabilities, but the conceptual transformation is outlined above.\n\n```python\n[\n    "FILTER_INTO_JOIN",\n    "FILTER_AGGREGATE_TRANSPOSE",\n    "JOIN_CONDITION_PUSH"\n]\n```', 'time': 7.295446395874023}
