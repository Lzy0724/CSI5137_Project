inefficiencies. The query involves a common table expression (CTE) `all_sales` that aggregates sales data from three different sales channels (catalog, store, and web) and then performs a self-join on this aggregated data to compare sales between two consecutive years.\n\n### Analysis and Optimization Steps:\n\n1. **Examine the CTE `all_sales`:**\n   - The CTE aggregates sales data from three different sources using a `UNION`. Each subquery within the `UNION` performs similar operations: joining with `item` and `date_dim` tables, left joining with returns tables, and filtering based on category and price conditions.\n   - The `UNION` operation is non-distinct, meaning it combines results from all subqueries without removing duplicates.\n\n2. **Potential Optimization Opportunities:**\n   - **Push Filters Down:** Filters applied after joins can often be pushed down to reduce the number of rows processed by the joins.\n   - **Optimize Joins:** Ensure that joins are efficient, possibly by reordering or removing unnecessary joins.\n   - **Aggregate and Filter Transpositions:** Consider transposing aggregates and filters to reduce the data processed at each stage.\n   - **Merge Aggregates:** If possible, merge aggregates to reduce the number of operations.\n\n3. **Select and Apply Rewrite Rules:**\n   - **FILTER_INTO_JOIN:** Push filter conditions into join conditions to reduce the number of rows early.\n   - **FILTER_AGGREGATE_TRANSPOSE:** Push filters past aggregates to reduce the data before aggregation.\n   - **AGGREGATE_UNION_TRANSPOSE:** Push aggregates past the `UNION` to perform aggregation on smaller datasets.\n   - **AGGREGATE_MERGE:** Merge aggregates if possible to simplify the query structure.\n\n### Applying the Selected Rules:\n\n1. **FILTER_INTO_JOIN:**\n   - Push the filter conditions from the `WHERE` clause of each subquery in the `UNION` into the join conditions. This reduces the number of rows processed by the joins.\n\n2. **FILTER_AGGREGATE_TRANSPOSE:**\n   - Transpose filters past the aggregate in the CTE `all_sales`. This allows filtering on `i_category`, `cs_sales_price`, etc., before aggregation, reducing the data size.\n\n3. **AGGREGATE_UNION_TRANSPOSE:**\n   - Push the aggregation past the `UNION`. This means performing the aggregation on each subquery separately before combining the results with a `UNION`.\n\n4. **AGGREGATE_MERGE:**\n   - If the aggregation keys are compatible, merge the aggregates to simplify the query structure.\n\nBy applying these rules, we can optimize the query to process fewer rows and perform aggregations more efficiently.\n\n```python\n[\n    "FILTER_INTO_JOIN",\n    "FILTER_AGGREGATE_TRANSPOSE",\n    "AGGREGATE_UNION_TRANSPOSE",\n    "AGGREGATE_MERGE"\n]\n```', 'time': 8.074672937393188}
