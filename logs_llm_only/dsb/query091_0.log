inefficiencies. The query involves multiple joins, a filter condition, and an aggregation with a `GROUP BY` clause. The goal is to apply rewrite rules that can improve the query\'s performance by optimizing these operations.\n\n### Analysis of the Query:\n1. **Joins**: The query involves multiple joins between tables. Optimizing join conditions and pushing filters into joins can improve performance.\n2. **Filters**: There are several filter conditions in the `WHERE` clause. Pushing these filters down to the join conditions can reduce the number of rows processed.\n3. **Aggregation**: The query performs aggregation with a `GROUP BY` clause. Ensuring that the aggregation is performed efficiently is crucial.\n\n### Applicable Rewrite Rules:\n1. **FILTER_INTO_JOIN**: This rule attempts to push filter expressions into join conditions. This can help reduce the number of rows processed by the join operations.\n2. **JOIN_CONDITION_PUSH**: This rule pushes predicates in a join into the inputs to the join, which can help in reducing the data processed by the join.\n3. **FILTER_AGGREGATE_TRANSPOSE**: This rule pushes a filter past an aggregate, which can be useful if the filter can reduce the number of groups processed by the aggregation.\n\n### Optimization Steps:\n1. **Apply FILTER_INTO_JOIN**: Push filter conditions into the join conditions to reduce the number of rows processed by the joins.\n2. **Apply JOIN_CONDITION_PUSH**: Further optimize join conditions by pushing predicates into the inputs of the join.\n3. **Apply FILTER_AGGREGATE_TRANSPOSE**: Push filters past the aggregation if applicable, to reduce the number of groups processed.\n\nLet\'s apply these rules step by step:\n\n1. **FILTER_INTO_JOIN**:\n   - Push the filter conditions such as `d_year = 2000`, `d_moy = 3`, `cd_marital_status = \'M\' and cd_education_status = \'Unknown\'`, etc., into the join conditions.\n\n2. **JOIN_CONDITION_PUSH**:\n   - Further optimize the join conditions by pushing predicates like `cr_call_center_sk = cc_call_center_sk` and `cr_returned_date_sk = d_date_sk` into the inputs of the join.\n\n3. **FILTER_AGGREGATE_TRANSPOSE**:\n   - If applicable, push filters past the aggregation to reduce the number of groups processed.\n\nBy applying these rules, we can potentially reduce the number of rows processed at each stage of the query, leading to improved performance.\n\n### Final Optimized Query:\nThe exact transformation of the query would depend on the database\'s query optimizer and the specific implementation of these rules. However, the conceptual transformation involves pushing filters into joins and optimizing join conditions.\n\n### Selected Rewrite Rules:\n```python\n[\n    "FILTER_INTO_JOIN",\n    "JOIN_CONDITION_PUSH",\n    "FILTER_AGGREGATE_TRANSPOSE"\n]\n```\n\nThese rules are selected based on their potential to optimize the query by reducing the number of rows processed and improving the efficiency of join and aggregation operations.', 'time': 6.14580512046814}
