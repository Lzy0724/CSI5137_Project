inefficiencies. The query involves multiple common table expressions (CTEs) and joins, which can be optimized by applying appropriate rewrite rules.\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **Common Table Expressions (CTEs):** The query uses two CTEs (`ss` and `ws`) that perform similar aggregations on different tables (`store_sales` and `web_sales`). Both CTEs have identical `WHERE` clauses and `GROUP BY` clauses, which suggests potential for optimization.\n\n2. **Joins:** The main query performs multiple self-joins on the CTEs (`ss` and `ws`). These joins are based on `ca_county`, `d_qoy`, and `d_year`, which are the grouping keys in the CTEs.\n\n3. **Filters:** The query includes several filters in the `WHERE` clause of the main query, which can potentially be pushed down to improve performance.\n\n### Optimization Strategy:\n1. **Filter Pushdown:** Use `FILTER_AGGREGATE_TRANSPOSE` to push filters from the main query into the CTEs. This can reduce the amount of data processed in the CTEs.\n\n2. **Merge Aggregates:** Since the CTEs perform similar aggregations, we can use `AGGREGATE_MERGE` to combine them if possible. However, in this case, they are on different tables, so direct merging isn\'t applicable.\n\n3. **Join Optimization:** Use `JOIN_CONDITION_PUSH` to push join conditions into the CTEs, which can help in reducing the intermediate result size.\n\n4. **Project and Filter Optimization:** Use `PROJECT_FILTER_TRANSPOSE` to push projections past filters, which can help in reducing the number of columns processed early.\n\n5. **Sort Optimization:** The query ends with an `ORDER BY` clause. If the input is already sorted, `SORT_REMOVE` can be applied to eliminate unnecessary sorting.\n\n### Selected Rules:\nBased on the analysis, the following rules are selected to optimize the query:\n\n1. **FILTER_AGGREGATE_TRANSPOSE:** To push filters into the CTEs.\n2. **JOIN_CONDITION_PUSH:** To push join conditions into the CTEs.\n3. **PROJECT_FILTER_TRANSPOSE:** To optimize the order of projections and filters.\n4. **SORT_REMOVE:** To remove unnecessary sorting if applicable.\n\n### Transformation Steps:\n1. **Apply FILTER_AGGREGATE_TRANSPOSE:** Push filters from the main query into the CTEs `ss` and `ws`.\n2. **Apply JOIN_CONDITION_PUSH:** Push join conditions into the CTEs to reduce intermediate result sizes.\n3. **Apply PROJECT_FILTER_TRANSPOSE:** Reorder projections and filters for efficiency.\n4. **Apply SORT_REMOVE:** Remove the `ORDER BY` if the input is already sorted.\n\n```python\n[\n    "FILTER_AGGREGATE_TRANSPOSE",\n    "JOIN_CONDITION_PUSH",\n    "PROJECT_FILTER_TRANSPOSE",\n    "SORT_REMOVE"\n]\n```\n\nThese steps should lead to a more efficient execution plan by reducing the amount of data processed at each stage and minimizing unnecessary operations.', 'time': 7.9641571044921875}
