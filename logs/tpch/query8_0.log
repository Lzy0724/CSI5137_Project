When the `LIMIT` clause is used to fetch a specified number of rows.\n2. When `ORDER BY` is used in conjunction with `LIMIT` to sort and limit the number of rows retrieved, particularly when sorting can leverage an index.\n3. When `DISTINCT` is used along with `LIMIT` to quickly identify and return unique rows without scanning the full dataset.\n4. During the use of `GROUP BY`, where optimization might involve sorting or traversing indexes in order to efficiently compute group values without processing the entire dataset.\n5. When sorting a specific number of rows from a single table based on non-indexed columns, utilizing in-memory sorting (`filesort`) techniques.\n**Transformations**: The specific SQL transformations that emerge from applying these optimization rules are:\n1. Combining `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY` encourages the database engine to stop the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained, avoiding full table sorts.\n2. Using `LIMIT` with `DISTINCT` leads to an early termination of the search for unique rows as soon as the needed amount is gathered, reducing time and resources spent on scanning the entire dataset.\n3. In the context of `GROUP BY`, optimizations may include indexing strategies or modifications to the way sorting is handled, such as employing `filesort` mechanisms that do not require temporary tables, ensuring that the database engine processes only the necessary data for group computations.\n4. Efficiencies are gained by encouraging the use of indexed columns with `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT`, making queries more efficient by reducing the cost associated with sorting and filtering operations.\n"""\nRule 2:\n"""\n**Conditions**: The SQL query rewrite rule applies when there are:\n- Functions or operations (especially deterministic ones) within the SELECT, WHERE, JOIN conditions, or any part of the query that is executed multiple times for the same row.\n- The presence of potentially computationally expensive operations or function calls that are not dependent on the data of the specific row and thus can be optimized.\n**Transformations**: 1. Move repeated function calls or operations outside of loops, if applicable. For example, if a function that generates a calculated value based on constants or parameters (not row-specific data) is being called in a loop, calculate the value once before the loop and store the result for reuse.\n   \n2. Replace inline functions in the SELECT or WHERE clause with a pre-calculated column if the function is deterministic and the input data does not change frequently. This might involve:\n   - Creating a temporary table that includes the results of the expensive function calls.\n   - Using a subquery or a Common Table Expression (CTE) that calculates the value once and then joins it with the main query.\n   \n3. When using aggregate functions that are called multiple times with the same parameters, consider storing the result in a variable or a temporary table, especially if the data set is large.\n\n4. Avoid using functions on indexed columns in the WHERE clause. This prevents the database from using the index efficiently. If a function must be used, consider creating a computed column that pre-calculates the function\'s result and index that column instead.\n\n5. If possible, simplify expressions and calculations to reduce their complexity and execution time. This might involve algebraic simplification or breaking down complex calculations into simpler parts that can be calculated separately and then combined.\n\nExample:\nOriginal Query:\n```sql\nSELECT id, name, expensive_function(column) as expensive_result\nFROM table\nWHERE expensive_function(column) > 100;\n```\n\nTransformed Query using a CTE:\n```sql\nWITH PreCalculated AS (\n  SELECT id, name, column, expensive_function(column) as expensive_result\n  FROM table\n)\nSELECT id, name, expensive_sel as expensive_result\nFROM PreCalculated\nWHERE expensive_result > 100;\n```\n"""\nRule 3:\n"""\n**Conditions**: The rule applies when the original SQL query performs multiple scans or joins on the same table to retrieve different attributes for certain conditions, or when the query structure results in redundant data processing and complexity that could be reduced.\n**Transformations**: - Combine multiple joins into a single join operation by using `CASE` statements to conditionally select different attributes from the table in one pass. \n- Use the `COALESCE` function in conjunction with `CASE` statements to efficiently merge conditional attributes into distinct columns based on specific criteria without the need for additional joins.\n- Optimize the selection of conditional attributes by integrating `GROUP BY` with aggregate functions like `MAX` within `CASE` statements, thus condensing the result set to only the necessary data and avoiding needless retrieval and processing steps.\n- The overall transformation leads to a single, more efficient query that accomplishes the tasks of multiple, less efficient operations, improving performance, and simplifying the query for better readability and maintenance.\n"""'}], 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'stream': False, 'temperature': 0.1}}

The filter's expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there's a matching row in the non-preserving side's table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned.\n```\n\nLogical Plan Changes After Rewrite: ```\n  LogicalSort(sort0=[$0(o_orderdate)], dir0=[ASC], fetch=[1])\r\n    LogicalProject(o_year=[$0(o_orderdate)], mkt_share=[/($1, $2)])\r\n      LogicalAggregate(group=[{0}], agg#0=[SUM($1)], agg#1=[SUM($2)])\r\n        LogicalProject(o_year=[EXTRACT(FLAG(YEAR), $36(o_orderdate))], $f1=[CASE(=(CAST($54(n_name)):CHAR(6) NOT NULL, 'CANADA'), *($21(l_extendedprice), -(1, $22(l_discount))), 0:DECIMAL(19, 4))], volume=[*($21(l_extendedprice), -(1, $22(l_discount)))])\r\n-         LogicalFilter(condition=[AND(=($0(p_partkey), $17(l_partkey)), =($9(s_suppkey), $18(l_suppkey)), =($16(l_orderkey), $32(o_orderkey)), =($33(o_custkey), $41(c_custkey)), =($44(c_nationkey), $49(n_nationkey)), =($51(n_regionkey), $57(r_regionkey)), =(CAST($58(r_name)):CHAR(7) NOT NULL, 'AMERICA'), =($12(s_nationkey), $53(n_nationkey)), >=($36(o_orderdate), 1995-01-01), <=($36(o_orderdate), 1996-12-31), =(CAST($4(p_type)):VARCHAR(21) NOT NULL, 'SMALL BURNISHED STEEL'))])\r\n+         LogicalJoin(condition=[=($51(n_regionkey), $57(r_regionkey))], joinType=[inner])\r\n-           LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n?                                   ^^\n\n+           LogicalJoin(condition=[=($12(s_nationkey), $53(n_nationkey))], joinType=[inner])\r\n?                                  ++++++++++ ^^^^ +++++++++++++++++++++\n\n-             LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n?                                     ^^\n\n+             LogicalJoin(condition=[=($44(c_nationkey), $49(n_nationkey))], joinType=[inner])\r\n?                                    ++++++++++ ^^^^ +++++++++++++++++++++\n\n-               LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n?                                       ^\n\n+               LogicalJoin(condition=[=($33(o_custkey), $41(c_custkey))], joinType=[inner])\r\n?                                      +++++++++++ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ +++ +++\n\n-                 LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n?                                        ^ ^\n\n+                 LogicalJoin(condition=[=($16(l_orderkey), $32(o_orderkey))], joinType=[inner])\r\n?                                        ^^^^^^^^^ ^ +++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n-                   LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n+                   LogicalJoin(condition=[AND(=($0(p_partkey), $17(l_partkey)), =($9(s_suppkey), $18(l_suppkey)))], joinType=[inner])\r\n                      LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n-                       LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n+                       LogicalFilter(condition=[=(CAST($4(p_type)):VARCHAR(21) NOT NULL, 'SMALL BURNISHED STEEL')])\r\n                          LogicalTableScan(table=[[part]])\r\n-                         LogicalTableScan(table=[[supplier]])\r\n? --\n\n+                       LogicalTableScan(table=[[supplier]])\r\n-                       LogicalTableScan(table=[[lineitem]])\r\n? --\n\n+                     LogicalTableScan(table=[[lineitem]])\r\n+                   LogicalFilter(condition=[SEARCH($4(o_orderdate), Sarg[[1995-01-01..1996-12-31]])])\r\n                      LogicalTableScan(table=[[orders]])\r\n-                   LogicalTableScan(table=[[customer]])\r\n? --\n\n+                 LogicalTableScan(table=[[customer]])\r\n-                 LogicalTableScan(table=[[nation]])\r\n                LogicalTableScan(table=[[nation]])\r\n+             LogicalTableScan(table=[[nation]])\r\n+           LogicalFilter(condition=[=(CAST($1(r_name)):CHAR(7) NOT NULL, 'AMERICA')])\r\n              LogicalTableScan(table=[[region]])\r\n  \n```"}], 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'stream': False, 'temperature': 0.1}}

The main change is in the `LogicalFilter` condition, where the date range condition `o_orderdate between date '1995-01-01' and date '1996-12-31'` has been transformed into a `SEARCH` condition `SEARCH($36(o_orderdate), Sarg[[1995-01-01..1996-12-31]])`. This transformation suggests a simplification or optimization of the date range condition.\n\nStep 2: Parsing the logical plan changes, we see that the original condition `o_orderdate between date '1995-01-01' and date '1996-12-31'` has been replaced with `SEARCH($36(o_orderdate), Sarg[[1995-01-01..1996-12-31]])`. This indicates a change in how the date range is processed, likely optimizing it for better performance by using a search argument (SARG) that can be more efficiently processed by the database engine.\n\nStep 3: The query rewrite rule contains multiple cases. In this scenario, the change corresponds to Case 3, where complex conditions in the WHERE clause are simplified based on known constraints or logical simplification. The transformation of the date range condition into a SARG is a form of logical simplification that optimizes the query execution.\n\nStep 4: The SQL query changes involve the transformation of the date range condition `o_orderdate between date '1995-01-01' and date '1996-12-31'` into a SARG `SEARCH($36(o_orderdate), Sarg[[1995-01-01..1996-12-31]])`. This transformation falls under Case 3 of the query rewrite rule, where complex conditions are simplified for optimization. By converting the date range into a SARG, the query can potentially execute more efficiently, as the database engine can leverage indexing and other optimizations to quickly filter the relevant rows based on the date range. This change does not alter the logical outcome of the query but enhances its performance.", 'time': 4.554379463195801}

The filter's expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there's a matching row in the non-preserving side's table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned.\n```\n\nLogical Plan Changes After Rewrite: ```\n  LogicalSort(sort0=[$0(o_orderdate)], dir0=[ASC], fetch=[1])\r\n    LogicalProject(o_year=[$0(o_orderdate)], mkt_share=[/($1, $2)])\r\n      LogicalAggregate(group=[{0}], agg#0=[SUM($1)], agg#1=[SUM($2)])\r\n        LogicalProject(o_year=[EXTRACT(FLAG(YEAR), $36(o_orderdate))], $f1=[CASE(=(CAST($54(n_name)):CHAR(6) NOT NULL, 'CANADA'), *($21(l_extendedprice), -(1, $22(l_discount))), 0:DECIMAL(19, 4))], volume=[*($21(l_extendedprice), -(1, $22(l_discount)))])\r\n-         LogicalFilter(condition=[AND(=($0(p_partkey), $17(l_partkey)), =($9(s_suppkey), $18(l_suppkey)), =($16(l_orderkey), $32(o_orderkey)), =($33(o_custkey), $41(c_custkey)), =($44(c_nationkey), $49(n_nationkey)), =($51(n_regionkey), $57(r_regionkey)), =(CAST($58(r_name)):CHAR(7) NOT NULL, 'AMERICA'), =($12(s_nationkey), $53(n_nationkey)), >=($36(o_orderdate), 1995-01-01), <=($36(o_orderdate), 1996-12-31), =(CAST($4(p_type)):VARCHAR(21) NOT NULL, 'SMALL BURNISHED STEEL'))])\r\n+         LogicalJoin(condition=[=($51(n_regionkey), $57(r_regionkey))], joinType=[inner])\r\n-           LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n?                                   ^^\n\n+           LogicalJoin(condition=[=($12(s_nationkey), $53(n_nationkey))], joinType=[inner])\r\n?                                  ++++++++++ ^^^^ +++++++++++++++++++++\n\n-             LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n?                                     ^^\n\n+             LogicalJoin(condition=[=($44(c_nationkey), $49(n_nationkey))], joinType=[inner])\r\n?                                    ++++++++++ ^^^^ +++++++++++++++++++++\n\n-               LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n?                                       ^\n\n+               LogicalJoin(condition=[=($33(o_custkey), $41(c_custkey))], joinType=[inner])\r\n?                                      +++++++++++ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ +++ +++\n\n-                 LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n?                                        ^ ^\n\n+                 LogicalJoin(condition=[=($16(l_orderkey), $32(o_orderkey))], joinType=[inner])\r\n?                                        ^^^^^^^^^ ^ +++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n-                   LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n+                   LogicalJoin(condition=[AND(=($0(p_partkey), $17(l_partkey)), =($9(s_suppkey), $18(l_suppkey)))], joinType=[inner])\r\n                      LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n-                       LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n+                       LogicalFilter(condition=[=(CAST($4(p_type)):VARCHAR(21) NOT NULL, 'SMALL BURNISHED STEEL')])\r\n                          LogicalTableScan(table=[[part]])\r\n-                         LogicalTableScan(table=[[supplier]])\r\n? --\n\n+                       LogicalTableScan(table=[[supplier]])\r\n-                       LogicalTableScan(table=[[lineitem]])\r\n? --\n\n+                     LogicalTableScan(table=[[lineitem]])\r\n+                   LogicalFilter(condition=[SEARCH($4(o_orderdate), Sarg[[1995-01-01..1996-12-31]])])\r\n                      LogicalTableScan(table=[[orders]])\r\n-                   LogicalTableScan(table=[[customer]])\r\n? --\n\n+                 LogicalTableScan(table=[[customer]])\r\n-                 LogicalTableScan(table=[[nation]])\r\n                LogicalTableScan(table=[[nation]])\r\n+             LogicalTableScan(table=[[nation]])\r\n+           LogicalFilter(condition=[=(CAST($1(r_name)):CHAR(7) NOT NULL, 'AMERICA')])\r\n              LogicalTableScan(table=[[region]])\r\n  \n```"}], 'response': "Step 1: The logical plan changes indicate that several filter conditions initially applied after the joins have been pushed down into the join conditions themselves. Specifically, the conditions that were part of the `LogicalFilter` have been moved into the `LogicalJoin` conditions. This is evident from the removal of the `LogicalFilter` and the addition of conditions in the `LogicalJoin` nodes.\n\nStep 2: Parsing the logical plan changes, we see that the following conditions have been moved:\n- `=($0(p_partkey), $17(l_partkey))` and `=($9(s_suppkey), $18(l_suppkey))` are now part of the first `LogicalJoin`.\n- `=($16(l_orderkey), $32(o_orderkey))` is now part of the second `LogicalJoin`.\n- `=($33(o_custkey), $41(c_custkey))` is now part of the third `LogicalJoin`.\n- `=($44(c_nationkey), $49(n_nationkey))` is now part of the fourth `LogicalJoin`.\n- `=($12(s_nationkey), $53(n_nationkey))` is now part of the fifth `LogicalJoin`.\n- `=($51(n_regionkey), $57(r_regionkey))` is now part of the sixth `LogicalJoin`.\nAdditionally, the filter condition `=(CAST($4(p_type)):VARCHAR(21) NOT NULL, 'SMALL BURNISHED STEEL')` has been applied directly to the `LogicalTableScan` of the `part` table, and the date range filter `SEARCH($4(o_orderdate), Sarg[[1995-01-01..1996-12-31]])` has been applied to the `LogicalTableScan` of the `orders` table.\n\nStep 3: The query rewrite rule contains multiple cases. The changes observed match Case 1 of the query rewrite rule. This case applies when filter conditions that can be logically associated with one side of an INNER JOIN are moved into the ON clause of the join. In this SQL query, the conditions moved into the join clauses only involve columns from one side of each join, which aligns with the conditions specified in Case 1.\n\nStep 4: The SQL query changes can be explained as follows: The original query had several filter conditions applied after the joins, which could be logically associated with one side of each join. According to Case 1 of the query rewrite rule, these conditions were moved into the ON clause of the respective INNER JOINs. This transformation optimizes the query by reducing the size of the datasets before the join occurs, potentially improving performance. For example, the condition `=($0(p_partkey), $17(l_partkey))` was moved into the ON clause of the join between `part` and `lineitem`, and similarly for other conditions and joins. Additionally, the filter on `p_type` was applied directly to the `part` table scan, and the date range filter was applied directly to the `orders` table scan, further optimizing the query execution.", 'time': 6.335947751998901}

This might involve:\n   - Creating a temporary table that includes the results of the expensive function calls.\n   - Using a subquery or a Common Table Expression (CTE) that calculates the value once and then joins it with the main query.\n   \n3. When using aggregate functions that are called multiple times with the same parameters, consider storing the result in a variable or a temporary table, especially if the data set is large.\n\n4. Avoid using functions on indexed columns in the WHERE clause. This prevents the database from using the index efficiently. If a function must be used, consider creating a computed column that pre-calculates the function\'s result and index that column instead.\n\n5.

03:18:05,474 root INFO Generated queries:
Query 1: The SQL query changes involve the transformation of the date range condition `o_orderdate between date '1995-01-01' and date '1996-12-31'` into a SARG `SEARCH($36(o_orderdate), Sarg[[1995-01-01..1996-12-31]])`. This transformation falls under Case 3 of the query rewrite rule, where complex conditions are simplified for optimization. By converting the date range into a SARG, the query can potentially execute more efficiently, as the database engine can leverage indexing and other optimizations to quickly filter the relevant rows based on the date range. This change does not alter the logical outcome of the query but enhances its performance.
Query 2: The SQL query changes can be explained as follows: The original query had several filter conditions applied after the joins, which could be logically associated with one side of each join. According to Case 1 of the query rewrite rule, these conditions were moved into the ON clause of the respective INNER JOINs. This transformation optimizes the query by reducing the size of the datasets before the join occurs, potentially improving performance. For example, the condition `=($0(p_partkey), $17(l_partkey))` was moved into the ON clause of the join between `part` and `lineitem`, and similarly for other conditions and joins. Additionally, the filter on `p_type` was applied directly to the `part` table scan, and the date range filter was applied directly to the `orders` table scan, further optimizing the query execution.
Query 3: The original query uses `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY`, which can be optimized by encouraging the database engine to stop the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained. This avoids a full table sort. Additionally, the use of `GROUP BY` can be optimized by ensuring that the database engine processes only the necessary data for group computations.

The transformation involves ensuring that the database engine efficiently handles the `ORDER BY o_year` and `LIMIT 1` by potentially leveraging indexes on `o_year` if available. This optimization is typically handled by the database engine itself, but understanding this can help in ensuring that indexes are in place for `o_year` to facilitate efficient sorting and limiting.
Query 4: The query uses the `extract(year from o_orderdate)` function, which is deterministic and executed for each row in the subquery. To optimize this, we can pre-calculate the year extraction outside of the main query loop. This can be done by creating a temporary table or a Common Table Expression (CTE) that calculates the year once and then uses it in the main query.

Transformed Query using a CTE:
```sql
WITH PreCalculatedYears AS (
  SELECT
    extract(year from o_orderdate) as o_year,
    l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount) as volume,
    n2.n_name as nation

    supplier,
    lineitem,
    orders,

    and s_suppkey = l_suppkey
    and l_orderkey = o_orderkey
    and o_custkey = c_custkey
    and c_nationkey = n1.n_nationkey
    and n1.n_regionkey = r_regionkey
    and r_name = 'AMERICA'
    and s_nationkey = n2.n_nationkey
    and o_orderdate between date '1995-01-01' and date '1996-12-31'
    and p_type = 'SMALL BURNISHED STEEL'
)
SELECT
  o_year,
  sum(case

    else 0
  end) / sum(volume) as mkt_share
FROM
  PreCalculatedYears
GROUP BY
  o_year
ORDER BY

LIMIT 1;
```
This transformation reduces the repeated execution of the `extract(year from o_orderdate)` function by calculating it once in the CTE.

"""The SQL query changes involve the transformation of the date range condition `o_orderdate between date '1995-01-01' and date '1996-12-31'` into a SARG `SEARCH($36(o_orderdate), Sarg[[1995-01-01..1996-12-31]])`. This transformation falls under Case 3 of the query rewrite rule, where complex conditions are simplified for optimization. By converting the date range into a SARG, the query can potentially execute more efficiently, as the database engine can leverage indexing and other optimizations to quickly filter the relevant rows based on the date range. This change does not alter the logical outcome of the query but enhances its performance."""

Query Rewrite 2:
"""The SQL query changes can be explained as follows: The original query had several filter conditions applied after the joins, which could be logically associated with one side of each join. According to Case 1 of the query rewrite rule, these conditions were moved into the ON clause of the respective INNER JOINs. This transformation optimizes the query by reducing the size of the datasets before the join occurs, potentially improving performance. For example, the condition `=($0(p_partkey), $17(l_partkey))` was moved into the ON clause of the join between `part` and `lineitem`, and similarly for other conditions and joins. Additionally, the filter on `p_type` was applied directly to the `part` table scan, and the date range filter was applied directly to the `orders` table scan, further optimizing the query execution."""

Query Rewrite 3:
"""The original query uses `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY`, which can be optimized by encouraging the database engine to stop the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained. This avoids a full table sort. Additionally, the use of `GROUP BY` can be optimized by ensuring that the database engine processes only the necessary data for group computations.

The transformation involves ensuring that the database engine efficiently handles the `ORDER BY o_year` and `LIMIT 1` by potentially leveraging indexes on `o_year` if available. This optimization is typically handled by the database engine itself, but understanding this can help in ensuring that indexes are in place for `o_year` to facilitate efficient sorting and limiting."""

Query Rewrite 4:
"""The query uses the `extract(year from o_orderdate)` function, which is deterministic and executed for each row in the subquery. To optimize this, we can pre-calculate the year extraction outside of the main query loop.

According to Case 1 of the query rewrite rule, these conditions were moved into the ON clause of the respective INNER JOINs. This transformation optimizes the query by reducing the size of the datasets before the join occurs, potentially improving performance. For example, the condition `=($0(p_partkey), $17(l_partkey))` was moved into the ON clause of the join between `part` and `lineitem`, and similarly for other conditions and joins. Additionally, the filter on `p_type` was applied directly to the `part` table scan, and the date range filter was applied directly to the `orders` table scan, further optimizing the query execution."""\n\n### Suggestion 3:\n"""The original query uses `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY`, which can be optimized by encouraging the database engine to stop the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained.

This optimization is typically handled by the database engine itself, but understanding this can help in ensuring that indexes are in place for `o_year` to facilitate efficient sorting and limiting."""\n\n### Suggestion 4:\n"""The query uses the `extract(year from o_orderdate)` function, which is deterministic and executed for each row in the subquery. To optimize this, we can pre-calculate the year extraction outside of the main query loop. This can be done by creating a temporary table or a Common Table Expression (CTE) that calculates the year once and then uses it in the main query.\n\nTransformed Query using a CTE:\n```sql\nWITH PreCalculatedYears AS (\n  SELECT\n    extract(year from o_orderdate) as o_year,\n    l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount) as volume,\n    n2.n_name as nation\n  FROM\n    part,\n    supplier,\n    lineitem,\n    orders,\n    customer,\n    nation n1,\n    nation n2,\n    region\n  WHERE\n    p_partkey = l_partkey\n    and s_suppkey = l_suppkey\n    and l_orderkey = o_orderkey\n    and o_custkey = c_custkey\n    and c_nationkey = n1.n_nationkey\n    and n1.n_regionkey = r_regionkey\n    and r_name = \'AMERICA\'\n    and s_nationkey = n2.n_nationkey\n    and o_orderdate between date \'1995-01-01\' and date \'1996-12-31\'\n    and p_type = \'SMALL BURNISHED STEEL\'\n)\nSELECT\n  o_year,\n  sum(case\n    when nation = \'CANADA\' then volume\n    else 0\n  end) / sum(volume) as mkt_share\nFROM\n  PreCalculatedYears\nGROUP BY\n  o_year\nORDER BY\n  o_year\nLIMIT 1;\n```\nThis transformation reduces the repeated execution of the `extract(year from o_orderdate)` function by calculating it once in the CTE."""\n\nQuery Rewrite Rules:\n### Rule FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains conditions that can be statically determined as always true (e.g., constant expressions like `1=1` or tautologies based on the column data types and constraints), then these conditions don\'t affect the result set.\n**Transformations**: Remove such conditions from the WHERE clause. If this results in an empty WHERE clause, remove the WHERE clause entirely.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause simplifies to conditions that are always false or involve comparisons with NULL in a way that the outcome is always false or NULL (e.g., `column != column` or `1=0`), indicating no rows can satisfy the filter.\n**Transformations**: Replace the query with one that selects no rows. This could be represented in different ways based on the SQL dialect. One universal method might be selecting from a dual table with a false condition.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains complex conditions that can be simplified based on known constraints, constants, or through logical simplification (e.g., `column IS NOT NULL AND column IS NOT NULL` simplifies to `column IS NOT NULL`).\n**Transformations**: Simplify the conditions according to logical rules and known constraints. Remove redundancy and unnecessary complexity."""\n\n### Rule FILTER_INTO_JOIN:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: This SQL query rewrite rule applies when a filter condition is placed on the result set of an INNER JOIN operation. The filter\'s expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there\'s a matching row in the non-preserving side\'s table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned."""\n\n### Rule JOIN_TO_CORRELATE:\n"""**Conditions**: The join type is either INNER JOIN or LEFT JOIN. There are no requirements in the query that would inherently create NULL values on the left side when there are no matching rows on the right side (for INNER JOIN, this condition is naturally met; for LEFT JOIN, it is met if every row on the left side has at least one corresponding row on the right side according to the join condition).\n**Transformations**: 1. Identify the INNER JOIN or LEFT JOIN condition in the SQL query. 2. Extract the ON clause representing the join condition. 3. For INNER JOIN: - Replace the INNER JOIN with a WHERE EXISTS clause, moving the original join condition into the WHERE clause of a subquery that selects from the right side table. Reference the left side columns as correlation variables in the subquery\'s WHERE clause. - Example Transformation: SELECT * FROM left_table INNER JOIN right_table ON left_table.id = right_table.foreign_id Becomes: SELECT * FROM left_table WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM right_table WHERE left_table.id = right_table.foreign_id) 4. For LEFT JOIN: - Replace the LEFT JOIN with a LEFT OUTER JOIN subquery that is correlated to the outer query. In the SELECT clause of the outer query, include a CASE statement or similar logic to handle selection from the subquery result. - Example Transformation: SELECT left_table.*, right_table.* FROM left_table LEFT JOIN right_table ON left_table.id = right_table.foreign_id Becomes: SELECT left_table.*, COALESCE(subquery.alias1, \'default\') FROM left_table LEFT OUTER JOIN (SELECT foreign_id, column1 AS alias1 FROM right_table) subquery ON left_table.id = subquery.foreign_id"""\n\n### Rule AGGREGATE_REDUCE_FUNCTIONS:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: any SELECT statement or subquery using the AVG aggregate function\n**Transformations**: AVG(x) as SUM(x) / COUNT(x)\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: computing the population standard deviation\n**Transformations**: STDDEV_POP(x) as the square root of (`SUM(x^2) - SUM(x)^2 / COUNT(x)`) / COUNT(x)\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: for the sample standard deviation computation\n**Transformations**: STDDEV_SAMP(x) as the square root of (`SUM(x^2) - SUM(x)^2 / COUNT(x)`) / (COUNT(x) - 1)\nCase 4:\n**Conditions**: for the population variance computation\n**Transformations**: VAR_POP(x) as (`SUM(x^2) - SUM(x)^2 / COUNT(x)`) / COUNT(x)\nCase 5:\n**Conditions**: for the sample variance computation\n**Transformations**: VAR_SAMP(x) as (`SUM(x^2) - SUM(x)^2 / COUNT(x)`) / (COUNT(x) - 1)\nCase 6:\n**Conditions**: to compute population covariance\n**Transformations**: COVAR_POP(x, y) by applying a formula involving SUM and COUNT\nCase 7:\n**Conditions**: using a formula for sample covariance\n**Transformations**: COVAR_SAMP(x, y) using a formula involving SUM, COUNT, and an adjustment for sample calculations\nCase 8:\n**Conditions**: for transforming REGR_SXX(x, y) and REGR_SYY(x, y)\n**Transformations**: into expressions involving the computation of VAR_POP(x) or VAR_POP(y) respectively, multiplied by REGR_COUNT(x, y)"""\n\n### Rule PROJECT_FILTER_TRANSPOSE:\n"""**Conditions**: This rewrite rule can be applied when an SQL query contains a SELECT operation (acting as the `Project` operation) followed by a WHERE clause (acting as the `Filter` operation), provided that the SELECT does not contain window functions (such as RANK(), ROW_NUMBER(), etc.) and the columns selected do not affect the outcome of the WHERE clause.\n**Transformations**: To apply the rule, refactor the SQL query so that the conditions in the WHERE clause are evaluated before the columns are selected in the SELECT clause. This may involve moving computations or column transformations from the SELECT clause to a sub-query that the WHERE clause is applied on, ensuring the final SELECT clause on the outermost query matches the original query\'s expected outcome. - Before: SELECT col1, transformation_function(col2) FROM table WHERE condition; - After: SELECT col1, transformation_function(col2) FROM (SELECT col1, col2 FROM table WHERE condition) AS subquery;"""\n\n### Rule SORT_PROJECT_TRANSPOSE:\n"""**Conditions**: If a SQL query executes a sort operation on columns that are directly referenced in the SELECT list or through expressions that are strictly monotonic transformations of these columns, and the sort operation directly follows these projections (SELECT statements), the sort operation can be pushed to operate directly on the table (FROM clause) before the projection.\n**Transformations**: 1. Check Compatibility: Ensure both sort and project (SELECT and ORDER BY clauses) involve compatible operations that relate directly to the raw column data or involve monotonic transformations.\n2. Analyze Order By Fields: Verify that each column in the ORDER BY clause is directly represented in the SELECT list or is a derived column through a monotonic transformation (e.g., casting integers to floats where the order is preserved).\n3. Adjust SQL Query: Rewrite the query so that sorting (ORDER BY clause) is applied to the raw table data in the FROM clause rather than after the projection. This might involve introducing a subquery or CTE (Common Table Expression) where the sorting is applied first, followed by the projections.\n4. Optimize Projection: Ensure that the SELECT list in the outer query matches the original projection, applying on top of the sorted data now."""'}], 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'stream': False, 'temperature': 0.1}}

For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN.

For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned."""\n\n### Rule JOIN_TO_CORRELATE:\n"""**Conditions**: The join type is either INNER JOIN or LEFT JOIN.

This transformation falls under Case 3 of the query rewrite rule, where complex conditions are simplified for optimization. By converting the date range into a SARG, the query can potentially execute more efficiently, as the database engine can leverage indexing and other optimizations to quickly filter the relevant rows based on the date range. This change does not alter the logical outcome of the query but enhances its performance."""\n\n### Suggestion 2:\n"""The SQL query changes can be explained as follows: The original query had several filter conditions applied after the joins, which could be logically associated with one side of each join. According to Case 1 of the query rewrite rule, these conditions were moved into the ON clause of the respective INNER JOINs. This transformation optimizes the query by reducing the size of the datasets before the join occurs, potentially improving performance. For example, the condition `=($0(p_partkey), $17(l_partkey))` was moved into the ON clause of the join between `part` and `lineitem`, and similarly for other conditions and joins. Additionally, the filter on `p_type` was applied directly to the `part` table scan, and the date range filter was applied directly to the `orders` table scan, further optimizing the query execution."""\n\n### Suggestion 3:\n"""The original query uses `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY`, which can be optimized by encouraging the database engine to stop the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained. This avoids a full table sort. Additionally, the use of `GROUP BY` can be optimized by ensuring that the database engine processes only the necessary data for group computations.\n\nThe transformation involves ensuring that the database engine efficiently handles the `ORDER BY o_year` and `LIMIT 1` by potentially leveraging indexes on `o_year` if available. This optimization is typically handled by the database engine itself, but understanding this can help in ensuring that indexes are in place for `o_year` to facilitate efficient sorting and limiting."""\n\n### Suggestion 4:\n"""The query uses the `extract(year from o_orderdate)` function, which is deterministic and executed for each row in the subquery. To optimize this, we can pre-calculate the year extraction outside of the main query loop. This can be done by creating a temporary table or a Common Table Expression (CTE) that calculates the year once and then uses it in the main query.\n\nTransformed Query using a CTE:\n```sql\nWITH PreCalculatedYears AS (\n  SELECT\n    extract(year from o_orderdate) as o_year,\n    l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount) as volume,\n    n2.n_name as nation\n  FROM\n    part,\n    supplier,\n    lineitem,\n    orders,\n    customer,\n    nation n1,\n    nation n2,\n    region\n  WHERE\n    p_partkey = l_partkey\n    and s_suppkey = l_suppkey\n    and l_orderkey = o_orderkey\n    and o_custkey = c_custkey\n    and c_nationkey = n1.n_nationkey\n    and n1.n_regionkey = r_regionkey\n    and r_name = \'AMERICA\'\n    and s_nationkey = n2.n_nationkey\n    and o_orderdate between date \'1995-01-01\' and date \'1996-12-31\'\n    and p_type = \'SMALL BURNISHED STEEL\'\n)\nSELECT\n  o_year,\n  sum(case\n    when nation = \'CANADA\' then volume\n    else 0\n  end) / sum(volume) as mkt_share\nFROM\n  PreCalculatedYears\nGROUP BY\n  o_year\nORDER BY\n  o_year\nLIMIT 1;\n```\nThis transformation reduces the repeated execution of the `extract(year from o_orderdate)` function by calculating it once in the CTE."""\n\nQuery Rewrite Rules:\n### Rule FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains conditions that can be statically determined as always true (e.g., constant expressions like `1=1` or tautologies based on the column data types and constraints), then these conditions don\'t affect the result set.\n**Transformations**: Remove such conditions from the WHERE clause.

This transformation falls under Case 3 of the query rewrite rule, where complex conditions are simplified for optimization. By converting the date range into a SARG, the query can potentially execute more efficiently, as the database engine can leverage indexing and other optimizations to quickly filter the relevant rows based on the date range. This change does not alter the logical outcome of the query but enhances its performance."""\n\n### Suggestion 2:\n"""The SQL query changes can be explained as follows: The original query had several filter conditions applied after the joins, which could be logically associated with one side of each join. According to Case 1 of the query rewrite rule, these conditions were moved into the ON clause of the respective INNER JOINs. This transformation optimizes the query by reducing the size of the datasets before the join occurs, potentially improving performance. For example, the condition `=($0(p_partkey), $17(l_partkey))` was moved into the ON clause of the join between `part` and `lineitem`, and similarly for other conditions and joins. Additionally, the filter on `p_type` was applied directly to the `part` table scan, and the date range filter was applied directly to the `orders` table scan, further optimizing the query execution."""\n\n### Suggestion 3:\n"""The original query uses `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY`, which can be optimized by encouraging the database engine to stop the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained. This avoids a full table sort. Additionally, the use of `GROUP BY` can be optimized by ensuring that the database engine processes only the necessary data for group computations.\n\nThe transformation involves ensuring that the database engine efficiently handles the `ORDER BY o_year` and `LIMIT 1` by potentially leveraging indexes on `o_year` if available. This optimization is typically handled by the database engine itself, but understanding this can help in ensuring that indexes are in place for `o_year` to facilitate efficient sorting and limiting."""\n\n### Suggestion 4:\n"""The query uses the `extract(year from o_orderdate)` function, which is deterministic and executed for each row in the subquery. To optimize this, we can pre-calculate the year extraction outside of the main query loop. This can be done by creating a temporary table or a Common Table Expression (CTE) that calculates the year once and then uses it in the main query.\n\nTransformed Query using a CTE:\n```sql\nWITH PreCalculatedYears AS (\n  SELECT\n    extract(year from o_orderdate) as o_year,\n    l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount) as volume,\n    n2.n_name as nation\n  FROM\n    part,\n    supplier,\n    lineitem,\n    orders,\n    customer,\n    nation n1,\n    nation n2,\n    region\n  WHERE\n    p_partkey = l_partkey\n    and s_suppkey = l_suppkey\n    and l_orderkey = o_orderkey\n    and o_custkey = c_custkey\n    and c_nationkey = n1.n_nationkey\n    and n1.n_regionkey = r_regionkey\n    and r_name = \'AMERICA\'\n    and s_nationkey = n2.n_nationkey\n    and o_orderdate between date \'1995-01-01\' and date \'1996-12-31\'\n    and p_type = \'SMALL BURNISHED STEEL\'\n)\nSELECT\n  o_year,\n  sum(case\n    when nation = \'CANADA\' then volume\n    else 0\n  end) / sum(volume) as mkt_share\nFROM\n  PreCalculatedYears\nGROUP BY\n  o_year\nORDER BY\n  o_year\nLIMIT 1;\n```\nThis transformation reduces the repeated execution of the `extract(year from o_orderdate)` function by calculating it once in the CTE."""\n\nQuery Rewrite Rule Sets:\n### FILTER Operator Rules: ["FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS", "FILTER_INTO_JOIN", "PROJECT_FILTER_TRANSPOSE"]\n\n### JOIN Operator Rules: ["FILTER_INTO_JOIN"]\n\n### PROJECT Operator Rules: ["PROJECT_FILTER_TRANSPOSE", "SORT_PROJECT_TRANSPOSE"]\n\n### SORT Operator Rules: ["SORT_PROJECT_TRANSPOSE"]\n\nQuery Rewrite Rule Explanations:\n### Rule FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains conditions that can be statically determined as always true (e.g., constant expressions like `1=1` or tautologies based on the column data types and constraints), then these conditions don\'t affect the result set.\n**Transformations**: Remove such conditions from the WHERE clause. If this results in an empty WHERE clause, remove the WHERE clause entirely.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause simplifies to conditions that are always false or involve comparisons with NULL in a way that the outcome is always false or NULL (e.g., `column != column` or `1=0`), indicating no rows can satisfy the filter.\n**Transformations**: Replace the query with one that selects no rows. This could be represented in different ways based on the SQL dialect. One universal method might be selecting from a dual table with a false condition.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains complex conditions that can be simplified based on known constraints, constants, or through logical simplification (e.g., `column IS NOT NULL AND column IS NOT NULL` simplifies to `column IS NOT NULL`).\n**Transformations**: Simplify the conditions according to logical rules and known constraints. Remove redundancy and unnecessary complexity."""\n\n### Rule FILTER_INTO_JOIN:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: This SQL query rewrite rule applies when a filter condition is placed on the result set of an INNER JOIN operation. The filter\'s expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there\'s a matching row in the non-preserving side\'s table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned."""\n\n### Rule PROJECT_FILTER_TRANSPOSE:\n"""**Conditions**: This rewrite rule can be applied when an SQL query contains a SELECT operation (acting as the `Project` operation) followed by a WHERE clause (acting as the `Filter` operation), provided that the SELECT does not contain window functions (such as RANK(), ROW_NUMBER(), etc.) and the columns selected do not affect the outcome of the WHERE clause.\n**Transformations**: To apply the rule, refactor the SQL query so that the conditions in the WHERE clause are evaluated before the columns are selected in the SELECT clause. This may involve moving computations or column transformations from the SELECT clause to a sub-query that the WHERE clause is applied on, ensuring the final SELECT clause on the outermost query matches the original query\'s expected outcome. - Before: SELECT col1, transformation_function(col2) FROM table WHERE condition; - After: SELECT col1, transformation_function(col2) FROM (SELECT col1, col2 FROM table WHERE condition) AS subquery;"""\n\n### Rule SORT_PROJECT_TRANSPOSE:\n"""**Conditions**: If a SQL query executes a sort operation on columns that are directly referenced in the SELECT list or through expressions that are strictly monotonic transformations of these columns, and the sort operation directly follows these projections (SELECT statements), the sort operation can be pushed to operate directly on the table (FROM clause) before the projection.\n**Transformations**: 1. Check Compatibility: Ensure both sort and project (SELECT and ORDER BY clauses) involve compatible operations that relate directly to the raw column data or involve monotonic transformations.\n2. Analyze Order By Fields: Verify that each column in the ORDER BY clause is directly represented in the SELECT list or is a derived column through a monotonic transformation (e.g., casting integers to floats where the order is preserved).\n3. Adjust SQL Query: Rewrite the query so that sorting (ORDER BY clause) is applied to the raw table data in the FROM clause rather than after the projection. This might involve introducing a subquery or CTE (Common Table Expression) where the sorting is applied first, followed by the projections.\n4. Optimize Projection: Ensure that the SELECT list in the outer query matches the original projection, applying on top of the sorted data now."""'}], 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'stream': False, 'temperature': 0.1}}

Suggestion 4 involves optimizing the execution of the `extract(year from o_orderdate)` function, which is not directly related to any FILTER rule but involves a transformation that could be considered under `PROJECT_FILTER_TRANSPOSE`. Therefore, the order should prioritize `FILTER_INTO_JOIN` for moving conditions into joins, followed by `FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS` for simplifying conditions.\n\n- **JOIN Operator Rules**: Suggestion 2 directly relates to `FILTER_INTO_JOIN`, which involves moving filter conditions into the ON clause of joins. Since this is the only rule in this set, it naturally aligns with the suggestion.\n\n- **PROJECT Operator Rules**: Suggestion 4 involves optimizing the execution of the `extract(year from o_orderdate)` function by using a CTE, which aligns with `PROJECT_FILTER_TRANSPOSE`. Suggestion 3 involves optimizing the `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT` operations, which could relate to `SORT_PROJECT_TRANSPOSE`. Therefore, the order should prioritize `PROJECT_FILTER_TRANSPOSE` for optimizing projections, followed by `SORT_PROJECT_TRANSPOSE` for sorting optimizations.\n\n- **SORT Operator Rules**: Suggestion 3 involves optimizing the `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT` operations, which aligns with `SORT_PROJECT_TRANSPOSE`. Since this is the only rule in this set, it naturally aligns with the suggestion.\n\nHere is the organized sequence of rules for each operator:\n\nFILTER Operator Rules: ```python\n[\n    "FILTER_INTO_JOIN",\n    "FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS"\n]\n```\n\nJOIN Operator Rules: ```python\n[\n    "FILTER_INTO_JOIN"\n]\n```\n\nPROJECT Operator Rules: ```python\n[\n    "PROJECT_FILTER_TRANSPOSE",\n    "SORT_PROJECT_TRANSPOSE"\n]\n```\n\nSORT Operator Rules: ```python\n[\n    "SORT_PROJECT_TRANSPOSE"\n]\n```', 'time': 4.868623495101929}

This transformation falls under Case 3 of the query rewrite rule, where complex conditions are simplified for optimization. By converting the date range into a SARG, the query can potentially execute more efficiently, as the database engine can leverage indexing and other optimizations to quickly filter the relevant rows based on the date range. This change does not alter the logical outcome of the query but enhances its performance."""\n\n### Suggestion 2:\n"""The SQL query changes can be explained as follows: The original query had several filter conditions applied after the joins, which could be logically associated with one side of each join. According to Case 1 of the query rewrite rule, these conditions were moved into the ON clause of the respective INNER JOINs. This transformation optimizes the query by reducing the size of the datasets before the join occurs, potentially improving performance. For example, the condition `=($0(p_partkey), $17(l_partkey))` was moved into the ON clause of the join between `part` and `lineitem`, and similarly for other conditions and joins. Additionally, the filter on `p_type` was applied directly to the `part` table scan, and the date range filter was applied directly to the `orders` table scan, further optimizing the query execution."""\n\n### Suggestion 3:\n"""The original query uses `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY`, which can be optimized by encouraging the database engine to stop the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained. This avoids a full table sort. Additionally, the use of `GROUP BY` can be optimized by ensuring that the database engine processes only the necessary data for group computations.\n\nThe transformation involves ensuring that the database engine efficiently handles the `ORDER BY o_year` and `LIMIT 1` by potentially leveraging indexes on `o_year` if available. This optimization is typically handled by the database engine itself, but understanding this can help in ensuring that indexes are in place for `o_year` to facilitate efficient sorting and limiting."""\n\n### Suggestion 4:\n"""The query uses the `extract(year from o_orderdate)` function, which is deterministic and executed for each row in the subquery. To optimize this, we can pre-calculate the year extraction outside of the main query loop. This can be done by creating a temporary table or a Common Table Expression (CTE) that calculates the year once and then uses it in the main query.\n\nTransformed Query using a CTE:\n```sql\nWITH PreCalculatedYears AS (\n  SELECT\n    extract(year from o_orderdate) as o_year,\n    l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount) as volume,\n    n2.n_name as nation\n  FROM\n    part,\n    supplier,\n    lineitem,\n    orders,\n    customer,\n    nation n1,\n    nation n2,\n    region\n  WHERE\n    p_partkey = l_partkey\n    and s_suppkey = l_suppkey\n    and l_orderkey = o_orderkey\n    and o_custkey = c_custkey\n    and c_nationkey = n1.n_nationkey\n    and n1.n_regionkey = r_regionkey\n    and r_name = \'AMERICA\'\n    and s_nationkey = n2.n_nationkey\n    and o_orderdate between date \'1995-01-01\' and date \'1996-12-31\'\n    and p_type = \'SMALL BURNISHED STEEL\'\n)\nSELECT\n  o_year,\n  sum(case\n    when nation = \'CANADA\' then volume\n    else 0\n  end) / sum(volume) as mkt_share\nFROM\n  PreCalculatedYears\nGROUP BY\n  o_year\nORDER BY\n  o_year\nLIMIT 1;\n```\nThis transformation reduces the repeated execution of the `extract(year from o_orderdate)` function by calculating it once in the CTE."""\n\nQuery Rewrite Rules:\n### Rule FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains conditions that can be statically determined as always true (e.g., constant expressions like `1=1` or tautologies based on the column data types and constraints), then these conditions don\'t affect the result set.\n**Transformations**: Remove such conditions from the WHERE clause. If this results in an empty WHERE clause, remove the WHERE clause entirely.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause simplifies to conditions that are always false or involve comparisons with NULL in a way that the outcome is always false or NULL (e.g., `column != column` or `1=0`), indicating no rows can satisfy the filter.\n**Transformations**: Replace the query with one that selects no rows. This could be represented in different ways based on the SQL dialect. One universal method might be selecting from a dual table with a false condition.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains complex conditions that can be simplified based on known constraints, constants, or through logical simplification (e.g., `column IS NOT NULL AND column IS NOT NULL` simplifies to `column IS NOT NULL`).\n**Transformations**: Simplify the conditions according to logical rules and known constraints. Remove redundancy and unnecessary complexity."""\n\n### Rule FILTER_INTO_JOIN:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: This SQL query rewrite rule applies when a filter condition is placed on the result set of an INNER JOIN operation. The filter\'s expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there\'s a matching row in the non-preserving side\'s table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned."""\n\n### Rule PROJECT_FILTER_TRANSPOSE:\n"""**Conditions**: This rewrite rule can be applied when an SQL query contains a SELECT operation (acting as the `Project` operation) followed by a WHERE clause (acting as the `Filter` operation), provided that the SELECT does not contain window functions (such as RANK(), ROW_NUMBER(), etc.) and the columns selected do not affect the outcome of the WHERE clause.\n**Transformations**: To apply the rule, refactor the SQL query so that the conditions in the WHERE clause are evaluated before the columns are selected in the SELECT clause. This may involve moving computations or column transformations from the SELECT clause to a sub-query that the WHERE clause is applied on, ensuring the final SELECT clause on the outermost query matches the original query\'s expected outcome. - Before: SELECT col1, transformation_function(col2) FROM table WHERE condition; - After: SELECT col1, transformation_function(col2) FROM (SELECT col1, col2 FROM table WHERE condition) AS subquery;"""\n\n### Rule SORT_PROJECT_TRANSPOSE:\n"""**Conditions**: If a SQL query executes a sort operation on columns that are directly referenced in the SELECT list or through expressions that are strictly monotonic transformations of these columns, and the sort operation directly follows these projections (SELECT statements), the sort operation can be pushed to operate directly on the table (FROM clause) before the projection.\n**Transformations**: 1. Check Compatibility: Ensure both sort and project (SELECT and ORDER BY clauses) involve compatible operations that relate directly to the raw column data or involve monotonic transformations.\n2. Analyze Order By Fields: Verify that each column in the ORDER BY clause is directly represented in the SELECT list or is a derived column through a monotonic transformation (e.g., casting integers to floats where the order is preserved).\n3. Adjust SQL Query: Rewrite the query so that sorting (ORDER BY clause) is applied to the raw table data in the FROM clause rather than after the projection. This might involve introducing a subquery or CTE (Common Table Expression) where the sorting is applied first, followed by the projections.\n4. Optimize Projection: Ensure that the SELECT list in the outer query matches the original projection, applying on top of the sorted data now."""\n\nRule Subset Sequences:\n### Rule Sequence 1: ["FILTER_INTO_JOIN", "FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS"]\n\n### Rule Sequence 2: ["FILTER_INTO_JOIN"]\n\n### Rule Sequence 3: ["PROJECT_FILTER_TRANSPOSE", "SORT_PROJECT_TRANSPOSE"]\n\n### Rule Sequence 4: ["SORT_PROJECT_TRANSPOSE"]'}], 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'stream': False, 'temperature': 0.1}}

This may involve moving computations or column transformations from the SELECT clause to a sub-query that the WHERE clause is applied on, ensuring the final SELECT clause on the outermost query matches the original query\'s expected outcome. - Before: SELECT col1, transformation_function(col2) FROM table WHERE condition; - After: SELECT col1, transformation_function(col2) FROM (SELECT col1, col2 FROM table WHERE condition) AS subquery;"""\n\n### Rule SORT_PROJECT_TRANSPOSE:\n"""**Conditions**: If a SQL query executes a sort operation on columns that are directly referenced in the SELECT list or through expressions that are strictly monotonic transformations of these columns, and the sort operation directly follows these projections (SELECT statements), the sort operation can be pushed to operate directly on the table (FROM clause) before the projection.\n**Transformations**: 1. Check Compatibility: Ensure both sort and project (SELECT and ORDER BY clauses) involve compatible operations that relate directly to the raw column data or involve monotonic transformations.\n2. Analyze Order By Fields: Verify that each column in the ORDER BY clause is directly represented in the SELECT list or is a derived column through a monotonic transformation (e.g., casting integers to floats where the order is preserved).\n3. Adjust SQL Query: Rewrite the query so that sorting (ORDER BY clause) is applied to the raw table data in the FROM clause rather than after the projection. This might involve introducing a subquery or CTE (Common Table Expression) where the sorting is applied first, followed by the projections.\n4. Optimize Projection: Ensure that the SELECT list in the outer query matches the original projection, applying on top of the sorted data now."""\n\nRule Subset Sequences:\n### Rule Sequence 1: ["FILTER_INTO_JOIN", "FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS"]\n\n### Rule Sequence 2: ["FILTER_INTO_JOIN"]\n\n### Rule Sequence 3: ["PROJECT_FILTER_TRANSPOSE", "SORT_PROJECT_TRANSPOSE"]\n\n### Rule Sequence 4: ["SORT_PROJECT_TRANSPOSE"]'}], 'response': 'To optimize the given SQL query, we need to apply the provided query rewrite rules in a sequence that maximizes efficiency. The suggestions and rules indicate several transformations that can be applied to the query. Let\'s analyze and organize these rules:\n\n1. **FILTER_INTO_JOIN**: This rule is crucial for moving filter conditions into the ON clause of joins, which can significantly reduce the dataset size before the join operation. This aligns with Suggestion 2, where conditions are moved into the ON clause to optimize the query.\n\n2. **FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS**: This rule simplifies complex conditions, such as transforming date range conditions into SARGs, as mentioned in Suggestion 1. This should follow the FILTER_INTO_JOIN to ensure that any simplified conditions are already in the optimal position within the query.\n\n3. **PROJECT_FILTER_TRANSPOSE**: This rule allows for the reordering of projections and filters, ensuring that filters are applied before projections. This is relevant to Suggestion 4, where the extraction of the year is optimized by using a CTE.\n\n4. **SORT_PROJECT_TRANSPOSE**: This rule optimizes the order of sorting and projection operations, which is relevant to Suggestion 3. It ensures that sorting is done efficiently, potentially leveraging indexes.\n\nGiven the rule subset sequences, we can derive the overall sequence for all the rules. The sequences suggest that FILTER_INTO_JOIN should be applied first, followed by FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS. PROJECT_FILTER_TRANSPOSE and SORT_PROJECT_TRANSPOSE can be applied subsequently, with SORT_PROJECT_TRANSPOSE potentially being the final step to ensure efficient sorting.\n\nTherefore, the overall sequence for applying the rules is:\n1. FILTER_INTO_JOIN\n2. FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS\n3. PROJECT_FILTER_TRANSPOSE\n4. SORT_PROJECT_TRANSPOSE\n\nThis sequence ensures that the query is optimized by reducing dataset sizes early, simplifying conditions, and efficiently handling projections and sorting.\n\n```python\n["FILTER_INTO_JOIN", "FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS", "PROJECT_FILTER_TRANSPOSE", "SORT_PROJECT_TRANSPOSE"]\n```', 'time': 4.679599046707153}

This transformation falls under Case 3 of the query rewrite rule, where complex conditions are simplified for optimization. By converting the date range into a SARG, the query can potentially execute more efficiently, as the database engine can leverage indexing and other optimizations to quickly filter the relevant rows based on the date range. This change does not alter the logical outcome of the query but enhances its performance."""\n\n### Suggestion 2:\n"""The SQL query changes can be explained as follows: The original query had several filter conditions applied after the joins, which could be logically associated with one side of each join. According to Case 1 of the query rewrite rule, these conditions were moved into the ON clause of the respective INNER JOINs. This transformation optimizes the query by reducing the size of the datasets before the join occurs, potentially improving performance. For example, the condition `=($0(p_partkey), $17(l_partkey))` was moved into the ON clause of the join between `part` and `lineitem`, and similarly for other conditions and joins. Additionally, the filter on `p_type` was applied directly to the `part` table scan, and the date range filter was applied directly to the `orders` table scan, further optimizing the query execution."""\n\n### Suggestion 3:\n"""The original query uses `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY`, which can be optimized by encouraging the database engine to stop the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained. This avoids a full table sort. Additionally, the use of `GROUP BY` can be optimized by ensuring that the database engine processes only the necessary data for group computations.\n\nThe transformation involves ensuring that the database engine efficiently handles the `ORDER BY o_year` and `LIMIT 1` by potentially leveraging indexes on `o_year` if available. This optimization is typically handled by the database engine itself, but understanding this can help in ensuring that indexes are in place for `o_year` to facilitate efficient sorting and limiting."""\n\n### Suggestion 4:\n"""The query uses the `extract(year from o_orderdate)` function, which is deterministic and executed for each row in the subquery. To optimize this, we can pre-calculate the year extraction outside of the main query loop. This can be done by creating a temporary table or a Common Table Expression (CTE) that calculates the year once and then uses it in the main query.\n\nTransformed Query using a CTE:\n```sql\nWITH PreCalculatedYears AS (\n  SELECT\n    extract(year from o_orderdate) as o_year,\n    l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount) as volume,\n    n2.n_name as nation\n  FROM\n    part,\n    supplier,\n    lineitem,\n    orders,\n    customer,\n    nation n1,\n    nation n2,\n    region\n  WHERE\n    p_partkey = l_partkey\n    and s_suppkey = l_suppkey\n    and l_orderkey = o_orderkey\n    and o_custkey = c_custkey\n    and c_nationkey = n1.n_nationkey\n    and n1.n_regionkey = r_regionkey\n    and r_name = \'AMERICA\'\n    and s_nationkey = n2.n_nationkey\n    and o_orderdate between date \'1995-01-01\' and date \'1996-12-31\'\n    and p_type = \'SMALL BURNISHED STEEL\'\n)\nSELECT\n  o_year,\n  sum(case\n    when nation = \'CANADA\' then volume\n    else 0\n  end) / sum(volume) as mkt_share\nFROM\n  PreCalculatedYears\nGROUP BY\n  o_year\nORDER BY\n  o_year\nLIMIT 1;\n```\nThis transformation reduces the repeated execution of the `extract(year from o_orderdate)` function by calculating it once in the CTE."""\n\nQuery Rewrite Rules:\n### Rule FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains conditions that can be statically determined as always true (e.g., constant expressions like `1=1` or tautologies based on the column data types and constraints), then these conditions don\'t affect the result set.\n**Transformations**: Remove such conditions from the WHERE clause. If this results in an empty WHERE clause, remove the WHERE clause entirely.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause simplifies to conditions that are always false or involve comparisons with NULL in a way that the outcome is always false or NULL (e.g., `column != column` or `1=0`), indicating no rows can satisfy the filter.\n**Transformations**: Replace the query with one that selects no rows. This could be represented in different ways based on the SQL dialect. One universal method might be selecting from a dual table with a false condition.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains complex conditions that can be simplified based on known constraints, constants, or through logical simplification (e.g., `column IS NOT NULL AND column IS NOT NULL` simplifies to `column IS NOT NULL`).\n**Transformations**: Simplify the conditions according to logical rules and known constraints. Remove redundancy and unnecessary complexity."""\n\n### Rule FILTER_INTO_JOIN:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: This SQL query rewrite rule applies when a filter condition is placed on the result set of an INNER JOIN operation. The filter\'s expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there\'s a matching row in the non-preserving side\'s table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned."""\n\n### Rule PROJECT_FILTER_TRANSPOSE:\n"""**Conditions**: This rewrite rule can be applied when an SQL query contains a SELECT operation (acting as the `Project` operation) followed by a WHERE clause (acting as the `Filter` operation), provided that the SELECT does not contain window functions (such as RANK(), ROW_NUMBER(), etc.) and the columns selected do not affect the outcome of the WHERE clause.\n**Transformations**: To apply the rule, refactor the SQL query so that the conditions in the WHERE clause are evaluated before the columns are selected in the SELECT clause.

This transformation falls under Case 3 of the query rewrite rule, where complex conditions are simplified for optimization. By converting the date range into a SARG, the query can potentially execute more efficiently, as the database engine can leverage indexing and other optimizations to quickly filter the relevant rows based on the date range. This change does not alter the logical outcome of the query but enhances its performance."""\n\n### Suggestion 2:\n"""The SQL query changes can be explained as follows: The original query had several filter conditions applied after the joins, which could be logically associated with one side of each join. According to Case 1 of the query rewrite rule, these conditions were moved into the ON clause of the respective INNER JOINs. This transformation optimizes the query by reducing the size of the datasets before the join occurs, potentially improving performance. For example, the condition `=($0(p_partkey), $17(l_partkey))` was moved into the ON clause of the join between `part` and `lineitem`, and similarly for other conditions and joins. Additionally, the filter on `p_type` was applied directly to the `part` table scan, and the date range filter was applied directly to the `orders` table scan, further optimizing the query execution."""\n\n### Suggestion 3:\n"""The original query uses `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY`, which can be optimized by encouraging the database engine to stop the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained. This avoids a full table sort. Additionally, the use of `GROUP BY` can be optimized by ensuring that the database engine processes only the necessary data for group computations.\n\nThe transformation involves ensuring that the database engine efficiently handles the `ORDER BY o_year` and `LIMIT 1` by potentially leveraging indexes on `o_year` if available. This optimization is typically handled by the database engine itself, but understanding this can help in ensuring that indexes are in place for `o_year` to facilitate efficient sorting and limiting."""\n\n### Suggestion 4:\n"""The query uses the `extract(year from o_orderdate)` function, which is deterministic and executed for each row in the subquery. To optimize this, we can pre-calculate the year extraction outside of the main query loop. This can be done by creating a temporary table or a Common Table Expression (CTE) that calculates the year once and then uses it in the main query.\n\nTransformed Query using a CTE:\n```sql\nWITH PreCalculatedYears AS (\n  SELECT\n    extract(year from o_orderdate) as o_year,\n    l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount) as volume,\n    n2.n_name as nation\n  FROM\n    part,\n    supplier,\n    lineitem,\n    orders,\n    customer,\n    nation n1,\n    nation n2,\n    region\n  WHERE\n    p_partkey = l_partkey\n    and s_suppkey = l_suppkey\n    and l_orderkey = o_orderkey\n    and o_custkey = c_custkey\n    and c_nationkey = n1.n_nationkey\n    and n1.n_regionkey = r_regionkey\n    and r_name = \'AMERICA\'\n    and s_nationkey = n2.n_nationkey\n    and o_orderdate between date \'1995-01-01\' and date \'1996-12-31\'\n    and p_type = \'SMALL BURNISHED STEEL\'\n)\nSELECT\n  o_year,\n  sum(case\n    when nation = \'CANADA\' then volume\n    else 0\n  end) / sum(volume) as mkt_share\nFROM\n  PreCalculatedYears\nGROUP BY\n  o_year\nORDER BY\n  o_year\nLIMIT 1;\n```\nThis transformation reduces the repeated execution of the `extract(year from o_orderdate)` function by calculating it once in the CTE."""\n\nQuery Rewrite Rules:\n### Rule FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains conditions that can be statically determined as always true (e.g., constant expressions like `1=1` or tautologies based on the column data types and constraints), then these conditions don\'t affect the result set.\n**Transformations**: Remove such conditions from the WHERE clause. If this results in an empty WHERE clause, remove the WHERE clause entirely.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause simplifies to conditions that are always false or involve comparisons with NULL in a way that the outcome is always false or NULL (e.g., `column != column` or `1=0`), indicating no rows can satisfy the filter.\n**Transformations**: Replace the query with one that selects no rows. This could be represented in different ways based on the SQL dialect. One universal method might be selecting from a dual table with a false condition.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains complex conditions that can be simplified based on known constraints, constants, or through logical simplification (e.g., `column IS NOT NULL AND column IS NOT NULL` simplifies to `column IS NOT NULL`).\n**Transformations**: Simplify the conditions according to logical rules and known constraints. Remove redundancy and unnecessary complexity."""\n\n### Rule FILTER_INTO_JOIN:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: This SQL query rewrite rule applies when a filter condition is placed on the result set of an INNER JOIN operation. The filter\'s expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there\'s a matching row in the non-preserving side\'s table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned."""\n\n### Rule PROJECT_FILTER_TRANSPOSE:\n"""**Conditions**: This rewrite rule can be applied when an SQL query contains a SELECT operation (acting as the `Project` operation) followed by a WHERE clause (acting as the `Filter` operation), provided that the SELECT does not contain window functions (such as RANK(), ROW_NUMBER(), etc.) and the columns selected do not affect the outcome of the WHERE clause.\n**Transformations**: To apply the rule, refactor the SQL query so that the conditions in the WHERE clause are evaluated before the columns are selected in the SELECT clause. This may involve moving computations or column transformations from the SELECT clause to a sub-query that the WHERE clause is applied on, ensuring the final SELECT clause on the outermost query matches the original query\'s expected outcome. - Before: SELECT col1, transformation_function(col2) FROM table WHERE condition; - After: SELECT col1, transformation_function(col2) FROM (SELECT col1, col2 FROM table WHERE condition) AS subquery;"""\n\n### Rule SORT_PROJECT_TRANSPOSE:\n"""**Conditions**: If a SQL query executes a sort operation on columns that are directly referenced in the SELECT list or through expressions that are strictly monotonic transformations of these columns, and the sort operation directly follows these projections (SELECT statements), the sort operation can be pushed to operate directly on the table (FROM clause) before the projection.\n**Transformations**: 1. Check Compatibility: Ensure both sort and project (SELECT and ORDER BY clauses) involve compatible operations that relate directly to the raw column data or involve monotonic transformations.\n2. Analyze Order By Fields: Verify that each column in the ORDER BY clause is directly represented in the SELECT list or is a derived column through a monotonic transformation (e.g., casting integers to floats where the order is preserved).\n3. Adjust SQL Query: Rewrite the query so that sorting (ORDER BY clause) is applied to the raw table data in the FROM clause rather than after the projection. This might involve introducing a subquery or CTE (Common Table Expression) where the sorting is applied first, followed by the projections.\n4. Optimize Projection: Ensure that the SELECT list in the outer query matches the original projection, applying on top of the sorted data now."""\n\nArranged Rule Sequence: ["FILTER_INTO_JOIN", "FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS", "PROJECT_FILTER_TRANSPOSE", "SORT_PROJECT_TRANSPOSE"]\n\nUtilized Rules: ["FILTER_INTO_JOIN", "SORT_PROJECT_TRANSPOSE"]\n\nUnutilized Rules: ["FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS", "PROJECT_FILTER_TRANSPOSE"]'}], 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'stream': False, 'temperature': 0.1}}

This transformation falls under Case 3 of the query rewrite rule, where complex conditions are simplified for optimization. By converting the date range into a SARG, the query can potentially execute more efficiently, as the database engine can leverage indexing and other optimizations to quickly filter the relevant rows based on the date range. This change does not alter the logical outcome of the query but enhances its performance."""\n\n### Suggestion 2:\n"""The SQL query changes can be explained as follows: The original query had several filter conditions applied after the joins, which could be logically associated with one side of each join. According to Case 1 of the query rewrite rule, these conditions were moved into the ON clause of the respective INNER JOINs. This transformation optimizes the query by reducing the size of the datasets before the join occurs, potentially improving performance. For example, the condition `=($0(p_partkey), $17(l_partkey))` was moved into the ON clause of the join between `part` and `lineitem`, and similarly for other conditions and joins. Additionally, the filter on `p_type` was applied directly to the `part` table scan, and the date range filter was applied directly to the `orders` table scan, further optimizing the query execution."""\n\n### Suggestion 3:\n"""The original query uses `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY`, which can be optimized by encouraging the database engine to stop the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained. This avoids a full table sort. Additionally, the use of `GROUP BY` can be optimized by ensuring that the database engine processes only the necessary data for group computations.\n\nThe transformation involves ensuring that the database engine efficiently handles the `ORDER BY o_year` and `LIMIT 1` by potentially leveraging indexes on `o_year` if available. This optimization is typically handled by the database engine itself, but understanding this can help in ensuring that indexes are in place for `o_year` to facilitate efficient sorting and limiting."""\n\n### Suggestion 4:\n"""The query uses the `extract(year from o_orderdate)` function, which is deterministic and executed for each row in the subquery. To optimize this, we can pre-calculate the year extraction outside of the main query loop. This can be done by creating a temporary table or a Common Table Expression (CTE) that calculates the year once and then uses it in the main query.\n\nTransformed Query using a CTE:\n```sql\nWITH PreCalculatedYears AS (\n  SELECT\n    extract(year from o_orderdate) as o_year,\n    l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount) as volume,\n    n2.n_name as nation\n  FROM\n    part,\n    supplier,\n    lineitem,\n    orders,\n    customer,\n    nation n1,\n    nation n2,\n    region\n  WHERE\n    p_partkey = l_partkey\n    and s_suppkey = l_suppkey\n    and l_orderkey = o_orderkey\n    and o_custkey = c_custkey\n    and c_nationkey = n1.n_nationkey\n    and n1.n_regionkey = r_regionkey\n    and r_name = \'AMERICA\'\n    and s_nationkey = n2.n_nationkey\n    and o_orderdate between date \'1995-01-01\' and date \'1996-12-31\'\n    and p_type = \'SMALL BURNISHED STEEL\'\n)\nSELECT\n  o_year,\n  sum(case\n    when nation = \'CANADA\' then volume\n    else 0\n  end) / sum(volume) as mkt_share\nFROM\n  PreCalculatedYears\nGROUP BY\n  o_year\nORDER BY\n  o_year\nLIMIT 1;\n```\nThis transformation reduces the repeated execution of the `extract(year from o_orderdate)` function by calculating it once in the CTE."""\n\nQuery Rewrite Rules:\n### Rule FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains conditions that can be statically determined as always true (e.g., constant expressions like `1=1` or tautologies based on the column data types and constraints), then these conditions don\'t affect the result set.\n**Transformations**: Remove such conditions from the WHERE clause. If this results in an empty WHERE clause, remove the WHERE clause entirely.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause simplifies to conditions that are always false or involve comparisons with NULL in a way that the outcome is always false or NULL (e.g., `column != column` or `1=0`), indicating no rows can satisfy the filter.\n**Transformations**: Replace the query with one that selects no rows. This could be represented in different ways based on the SQL dialect. One universal method might be selecting from a dual table with a false condition.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains complex conditions that can be simplified based on known constraints, constants, or through logical simplification (e.g., `column IS NOT NULL AND column IS NOT NULL` simplifies to `column IS NOT NULL`).\n**Transformations**: Simplify the conditions according to logical rules and known constraints. Remove redundancy and unnecessary complexity."""\n\n### Rule FILTER_INTO_JOIN:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: This SQL query rewrite rule applies when a filter condition is placed on the result set of an INNER JOIN operation. The filter\'s expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there\'s a matching row in the non-preserving side\'s table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned."""\n\n### Rule PROJECT_FILTER_TRANSPOSE:\n"""**Conditions**: This rewrite rule can be applied when an SQL query contains a SELECT operation (acting as the `Project` operation) followed by a WHERE clause (acting as the `Filter` operation), provided that the SELECT does not contain window functions (such as RANK(), ROW_NUMBER(), etc.) and the columns selected do not affect the outcome of the WHERE clause.\n**Transformations**: To apply the rule, refactor the SQL query so that the conditions in the WHERE clause are evaluated before the columns are selected in the SELECT clause. This may involve moving computations or column transformations from the SELECT clause to a sub-query that the WHERE clause is applied on, ensuring the final SELECT clause on the outermost query matches the original query\'s expected outcome. - Before: SELECT col1, transformation_function(col2) FROM table WHERE condition; - After: SELECT col1, transformation_function(col2) FROM (SELECT col1, col2 FROM table WHERE condition) AS subquery;"""\n\n### Rule SORT_PROJECT_TRANSPOSE:\n"""**Conditions**: If a SQL query executes a sort operation on columns that are directly referenced in the SELECT list or through expressions that are strictly monotonic transformations of these columns, and the sort operation directly follows these projections (SELECT statements), the sort operation can be pushed to operate directly on the table (FROM clause) before the projection.\n**Transformations**: 1. Check Compatibility: Ensure both sort and project (SELECT and ORDER BY clauses) involve compatible operations that relate directly to the raw column data or involve monotonic transformations.\n2. Analyze Order By Fields: Verify that each column in the ORDER BY clause is directly represented in the SELECT list or is a derived column through a monotonic transformation (e.g., casting integers to floats where the order is preserved).\n3. Adjust SQL Query: Rewrite the query so that sorting (ORDER BY clause) is applied to the raw table data in the FROM clause rather than after the projection. This might involve introducing a subquery or CTE (Common Table Expression) where the sorting is applied first, followed by the projections.\n4.
