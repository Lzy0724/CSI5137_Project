When the `LIMIT` clause is used to fetch a specified number of rows.\n2. When `ORDER BY` is used in conjunction with `LIMIT` to sort and limit the number of rows retrieved, particularly when sorting can leverage an index.\n3. When `DISTINCT` is used along with `LIMIT` to quickly identify and return unique rows without scanning the full dataset.\n4. During the use of `GROUP BY`, where optimization might involve sorting or traversing indexes in order to efficiently compute group values without processing the entire dataset.\n5. When sorting a specific number of rows from a single table based on non-indexed columns, utilizing in-memory sorting (`filesort`) techniques.\n**Transformations**: The specific SQL transformations that emerge from applying these optimization rules are:\n1. Combining `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY` encourages the database engine to stop the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained, avoiding full table sorts.\n2. Using `LIMIT` with `DISTINCT` leads to an early termination of the search for unique rows as soon as the needed amount is gathered, reducing time and resources spent on scanning the entire dataset.\n3. In the context of `GROUP BY`, optimizations may include indexing strategies or modifications to the way sorting is handled, such as employing `filesort` mechanisms that do not require temporary tables, ensuring that the database engine processes only the necessary data for group computations.\n4. Efficiencies are gained by encouraging the use of indexed columns with `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT`, making queries more efficient by reducing the cost associated with sorting and filtering operations.\n"""\nRule 2:\n"""\n**Conditions**: The SQL query rewrite rule applies when there are:\n- Functions or operations (especially deterministic ones) within the SELECT, WHERE, JOIN conditions, or any part of the query that is executed multiple times for the same row.\n- The presence of potentially computationally expensive operations or function calls that are not dependent on the data of the specific row and thus can be optimized.\n**Transformations**: 1. Move repeated function calls or operations outside of loops, if applicable. For example, if a function that generates a calculated value based on constants or parameters (not row-specific data) is being called in a loop, calculate the value once before the loop and store the result for reuse.\n   \n2. Replace inline functions in the SELECT or WHERE clause with a pre-calculated column if the function is deterministic and the input data does not change frequently. This might involve:\n   - Creating a temporary table that includes the results of the expensive function calls.\n   - Using a subquery or a Common Table Expression (CTE) that calculates the value once and then joins it with the main query.\n   \n3. When using aggregate functions that are called multiple times with the same parameters, consider storing the result in a variable or a temporary table, especially if the data set is large.\n\n4. Avoid using functions on indexed columns in the WHERE clause. This prevents the database from using the index efficiently. If a function must be used, consider creating a computed column that pre-calculates the function\'s result and index that column instead.\n\n5. If possible, simplify expressions and calculations to reduce their complexity and execution time. This might involve algebraic simplification or breaking down complex calculations into simpler parts that can be calculated separately and then combined.\n\nExample:\nOriginal Query:\n```sql\nSELECT id, name, expensive_function(column) as expensive_result\nFROM table\nWHERE expensive_function(column) > 100;\n```\n\nTransformed Query using a CTE:\n```sql\nWITH PreCalculated AS (\n  SELECT id, name, column, expensive_function(column) as expensive_result\n  FROM table\n)\nSELECT id, name, expensive_sel as expensive_result\nFROM PreCalculated\nWHERE expensive_result > 100;\n```\n"""\nRule 3:\n"""\n**Conditions**: The rule applies when the original SQL query performs multiple scans or joins on the same table to retrieve different attributes for certain conditions, or when the query structure results in redundant data processing and complexity that could be reduced.\n**Transformations**: - Combine multiple joins into a single join operation by using `CASE` statements to conditionally select different attributes from the table in one pass. \n- Use the `COALESCE` function in conjunction with `CASE` statements to efficiently merge conditional attributes into distinct columns based on specific criteria without the need for additional joins.\n- Optimize the selection of conditional attributes by integrating `GROUP BY` with aggregate functions like `MAX` within `CASE` statements, thus condensing the result set to only the necessary data and avoiding needless retrieval and processing steps.\n- The overall transformation leads to a single, more efficient query that accomplishes the tasks of multiple, less efficient operations, improving performance, and simplifying the query for better readability and maintenance.\n"""'}], 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'stream': False, 'temperature': 0.1}}

The filter's expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there's a matching row in the non-preserving side's table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned.\n```\n\nLogical Plan Changes After Rewrite: ```\n  LogicalSort(sort0=[$0(o_orderdate)], dir0=[ASC], fetch=[1])\r\n    LogicalProject(o_year=[$0(o_orderdate)], mkt_share=[/($1, $2)])\r\n      LogicalAggregate(group=[{0}], agg#0=[SUM($1)], agg#1=[SUM($2)])\r\n        LogicalProject(o_year=[EXTRACT(FLAG(YEAR), $36(o_orderdate))], $f1=[CASE(=(CAST($54(n_name)):CHAR(12) NOT NULL, 'SAUDI ARABIA'), *($21(l_extendedprice), -(1, $22(l_discount))), 0:DECIMAL(19, 4))], volume=[*($21(l_extendedprice), -(1, $22(l_discount)))])\r\n-         LogicalFilter(condition=[AND(=($0(p_partkey), $17(l_partkey)), =($9(s_suppkey), $18(l_suppkey)), =($16(l_orderkey), $32(o_orderkey)), =($33(o_custkey), $41(c_custkey)), =($44(c_nationkey), $49(n_nationkey)), =($51(n_regionkey), $57(r_regionkey)), =(CAST($58(r_name)):CHAR(11) NOT NULL, 'MIDDLE EAST'), =($12(s_nationkey), $53(n_nationkey)), >=($36(o_orderdate), 1995-01-01), <=($36(o_orderdate), 1996-12-31), =(CAST($4(p_type)):VARCHAR(22) NOT NULL, 'STANDARD BRUSHED STEEL'))])\r\n+         LogicalJoin(condition=[=($51(n_regionkey), $57(r_regionkey))], joinType=[inner])\r\n-           LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n?                                   ^^\n\n+           LogicalJoin(condition=[=($12(s_nationkey), $53(n_nationkey))], joinType=[inner])\r\n?                                  ++++++++++ ^^^^ +++++++++++++++++++++\n\n-             LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n?                                     ^^\n\n+             LogicalJoin(condition=[=($44(c_nationkey), $49(n_nationkey))], joinType=[inner])\r\n?                                    ++++++++++ ^^^^ +++++++++++++++++++++\n\n-               LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n?                                       ^\n\n+               LogicalJoin(condition=[=($33(o_custkey), $41(c_custkey))], joinType=[inner])\r\n?                                      +++++++++++ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ +++ +++\n\n-                 LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n?                                        ^ ^\n\n+                 LogicalJoin(condition=[=($16(l_orderkey), $32(o_orderkey))], joinType=[inner])\r\n?                                        ^^^^^^^^^ ^ +++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n-                   LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n+                   LogicalJoin(condition=[AND(=($0(p_partkey), $17(l_partkey)), =($9(s_suppkey), $18(l_suppkey)))], joinType=[inner])\r\n                      LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n-                       LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n+                       LogicalFilter(condition=[=(CAST($4(p_type)):VARCHAR(22) NOT NULL, 'STANDARD BRUSHED STEEL')])\r\n                          LogicalTableScan(table=[[part]])\r\n-                         LogicalTableScan(table=[[supplier]])\r\n? --\n\n+                       LogicalTableScan(table=[[supplier]])\r\n-                       LogicalTableScan(table=[[lineitem]])\r\n? --\n\n+                     LogicalTableScan(table=[[lineitem]])\r\n+                   LogicalFilter(condition=[SEARCH($4(o_orderdate), Sarg[[1995-01-01..1996-12-31]])])\r\n                      LogicalTableScan(table=[[orders]])\r\n-                   LogicalTableScan(table=[[customer]])\r\n? --\n\n+                 LogicalTableScan(table=[[customer]])\r\n-                 LogicalTableScan(table=[[nation]])\r\n                LogicalTableScan(table=[[nation]])\r\n+             LogicalTableScan(table=[[nation]])\r\n+           LogicalFilter(condition=[=(CAST($1(r_name)):CHAR(11) NOT NULL, 'MIDDLE EAST')])\r\n              LogicalTableScan(table=[[region]])\r\n  \n```"}], 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'stream': False, 'temperature': 0.1}}

The filter's expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there's a matching row in the non-preserving side's table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned.\n```\n\nLogical Plan Changes After Rewrite: ```\n  LogicalSort(sort0=[$0(o_orderdate)], dir0=[ASC], fetch=[1])\r\n    LogicalProject(o_year=[$0(o_orderdate)], mkt_share=[/($1, $2)])\r\n      LogicalAggregate(group=[{0}], agg#0=[SUM($1)], agg#1=[SUM($2)])\r\n        LogicalProject(o_year=[EXTRACT(FLAG(YEAR), $36(o_orderdate))], $f1=[CASE(=(CAST($54(n_name)):CHAR(12) NOT NULL, 'SAUDI ARABIA'), *($21(l_extendedprice), -(1, $22(l_discount))), 0:DECIMAL(19, 4))], volume=[*($21(l_extendedprice), -(1, $22(l_discount)))])\r\n-         LogicalFilter(condition=[AND(=($0(p_partkey), $17(l_partkey)), =($9(s_suppkey), $18(l_suppkey)), =($16(l_orderkey), $32(o_orderkey)), =($33(o_custkey), $41(c_custkey)), =($44(c_nationkey), $49(n_nationkey)), =($51(n_regionkey), $57(r_regionkey)), =(CAST($58(r_name)):CHAR(11) NOT NULL, 'MIDDLE EAST'), =($12(s_nationkey), $53(n_nationkey)), >=($36(o_orderdate), 1995-01-01), <=($36(o_orderdate), 1996-12-31), =(CAST($4(p_type)):VARCHAR(22) NOT NULL, 'STANDARD BRUSHED STEEL'))])\r\n+         LogicalJoin(condition=[=($51(n_regionkey), $57(r_regionkey))], joinType=[inner])\r\n-           LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n?                                   ^^\n\n+           LogicalJoin(condition=[=($12(s_nationkey), $53(n_nationkey))], joinType=[inner])\r\n?                                  ++++++++++ ^^^^ +++++++++++++++++++++\n\n-             LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n?                                     ^^\n\n+             LogicalJoin(condition=[=($44(c_nationkey), $49(n_nationkey))], joinType=[inner])\r\n?                                    ++++++++++ ^^^^ +++++++++++++++++++++\n\n-               LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n?                                       ^\n\n+               LogicalJoin(condition=[=($33(o_custkey), $41(c_custkey))], joinType=[inner])\r\n?                                      +++++++++++ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ +++ +++\n\n-                 LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n?                                        ^ ^\n\n+                 LogicalJoin(condition=[=($16(l_orderkey), $32(o_orderkey))], joinType=[inner])\r\n?                                        ^^^^^^^^^ ^ +++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n-                   LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n+                   LogicalJoin(condition=[AND(=($0(p_partkey), $17(l_partkey)), =($9(s_suppkey), $18(l_suppkey)))], joinType=[inner])\r\n                      LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n-                       LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n+                       LogicalFilter(condition=[=(CAST($4(p_type)):VARCHAR(22) NOT NULL, 'STANDARD BRUSHED STEEL')])\r\n                          LogicalTableScan(table=[[part]])\r\n-                         LogicalTableScan(table=[[supplier]])\r\n? --\n\n+                       LogicalTableScan(table=[[supplier]])\r\n-                       LogicalTableScan(table=[[lineitem]])\r\n? --\n\n+                     LogicalTableScan(table=[[lineitem]])\r\n+                   LogicalFilter(condition=[SEARCH($4(o_orderdate), Sarg[[1995-01-01..1996-12-31]])])\r\n                      LogicalTableScan(table=[[orders]])\r\n-                   LogicalTableScan(table=[[customer]])\r\n? --\n\n+                 LogicalTableScan(table=[[customer]])\r\n-                 LogicalTableScan(table=[[nation]])\r\n                LogicalTableScan(table=[[nation]])\r\n+             LogicalTableScan(table=[[nation]])\r\n+           LogicalFilter(condition=[=(CAST($1(r_name)):CHAR(11) NOT NULL, 'MIDDLE EAST')])\r\n              LogicalTableScan(table=[[region]])\r\n  \n```"}], 'response': "Step 1: The logical plan changes indicate that several filter conditions initially present in the `WHERE` clause have been moved into the `ON` clause of corresponding `INNER JOIN` operations. This is evident from the transformation of `LogicalFilter` conditions into `LogicalJoin` conditions, where specific equality conditions between columns of different tables are now part of the join conditions.\n\nStep 2: Parsing the logical plan changes, we observe the following detailed changes in the SQL query:\n- The condition `p_partkey = l_partkey` and `s_suppkey = l_suppkey` are moved from the `WHERE` clause to the `ON` clause of the join between `part`, `supplier`, and `lineitem`.\n- The condition `l_orderkey = o_orderkey` is moved to the `ON` clause of the join between `lineitem` and `orders`.\n- The condition `o_custkey = c_custkey` is moved to the `ON` clause of the join between `orders` and `customer`.\n- The condition `c_nationkey = n1.n_nationkey` is moved to the `ON` clause of the join between `customer` and `nation n1`.\n- The condition `n1.n_regionkey = r_regionkey` is moved to the `ON` clause of the join between `nation n1` and `region`.\n- The condition `s_nationkey = n2.n_nationkey` is moved to the `ON` clause of the join between `supplier` and `nation n2`.\n- The filter condition `p_type = 'STANDARD BRUSHED STEEL'` is applied directly to the `part` table.\n- The filter condition `o_orderdate between date '1995-01-01' and date '1996-12-31'` is applied directly to the `orders` table.\n- The filter condition `r_name = 'MIDDLE EAST'` is applied directly to the `region` table.\n\nStep 3: The query rewrite rule contains multiple cases. The changes observed in the logical plan match Case 1 of the query rewrite rule. This case applies when filter conditions in a `WHERE` clause can be logically associated with columns from one side of an `INNER JOIN` and can be moved into the `ON` clause of the join.\n\nStep 4: The SQL query changes can be explained by Case 1 of the query rewrite rule. The original SQL query had several filter conditions in the `WHERE` clause that only involved columns from one side of the respective `INNER JOIN` operations. By moving these conditions into the `ON` clause of the joins, the query optimizer can potentially reduce the size of intermediate datasets before performing the join operations, leading to more efficient query execution. For example, the condition `p_partkey = l_partkey` was moved to the `ON` clause of the join between `part` and `lineitem`, and similarly for other conditions involving `s_suppkey`, `l_orderkey`, `o_custkey`, `c_nationkey`, `n_regionkey`, and `s_nationkey`. This transformation aligns with the rule's transformation of moving conditions into the `ON` clause when they only involve columns from one side of the join.", 'time': 6.651576519012451}

The original condition included a range filter on `o_orderdate` using `>=` and `<=` operators. After the rewrite, this condition has been replaced with a `SEARCH` function that specifies a range (`Sarg[[1995-01-01..1996-12-31]]`). This indicates a simplification or optimization of the date range condition.\n\nStep 2: Parsing the logical plan changes, we see that the SQL query's `WHERE` clause originally contained the condition `o_orderdate between date '1995-01-01' and date '1996-12-31'`. This condition was rewritten to use a `SEARCH` function, which is a more efficient way to express the same range condition. The rest of the `WHERE` clause remains unchanged.\n\nStep 3: The query rewrite rule contains multiple cases. In this scenario, the changes match Case 3, which deals with simplifying complex conditions based on known constraints or logical simplifications. The transformation involved replacing the `between` condition with a `SEARCH` function, which is a simplification for range queries.\n\nStep 4: The SQL query changes can be explained as follows: The original `WHERE` clause contained a condition `o_orderdate between date '1995-01-01' and date '1996-12-31'`.

The rewrite process replaced this condition with a `SEARCH` function, `SEARCH($36(o_orderdate), Sarg[[1995-01-01..1996-12-31]])`, which is a more efficient representation of the same date range filter.

Query 1: The SQL query changes can be explained as follows: The original `WHERE` clause contained a condition `o_orderdate between date '1995-01-01' and date '1996-12-31'`. This condition was identified as a candidate for simplification under Case 3 of the query rewrite rule. The rewrite process replaced this condition with a `SEARCH` function, `SEARCH($36(o_orderdate), Sarg[[1995-01-01..1996-12-31]])`, which is a more efficient representation of the same date range filter. This transformation optimizes the query by potentially improving the performance of the date range filter without altering the logical outcome of the query.
Query 2: The SQL query changes can be explained by Case 1 of the query rewrite rule. The original SQL query had several filter conditions in the `WHERE` clause that only involved columns from one side of the respective `INNER JOIN` operations. By moving these conditions into the `ON` clause of the joins, the query optimizer can potentially reduce the size of intermediate datasets before performing the join operations, leading to more efficient query execution. For example, the condition `p_partkey = l_partkey` was moved to the `ON` clause of the join between `part` and `lineitem`, and similarly for other conditions involving `s_suppkey`, `l_orderkey`, `o_custkey`, `c_nationkey`, `n_regionkey`, and `s_nationkey`. This transformation aligns with the rule's transformation of moving conditions into the `ON` clause when they only involve columns from one side of the join.
Query 3: The query uses `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY`, which can be optimized by ensuring that the database engine stops sorting as soon as the required number of rows is obtained. This can be achieved by leveraging indexes on `o_year` if possible, or by ensuring that the sorting operation is efficient. Additionally, the `GROUP BY` operation can be optimized by using indexing strategies or in-memory sorting techniques (`filesort`) to compute group values efficiently. However, since `o_year` is derived from `o_orderdate`, creating an index directly on `o_year` is not straightforward. Instead, ensuring efficient execution of the `GROUP BY` and `ORDER BY` operations through database-specific optimizations is key.
Query 4: The query uses the `extract(year from o_orderdate)` function, which is deterministic and executed for each row. To optimize this, we can pre-calculate the year extraction outside of the main query loop. This can be done by creating a Common Table Expression (CTE) or a subquery that calculates the year once and then uses it in the main query. This reduces the computational overhead of repeatedly extracting the year for each row.

Transformed Query using a CTE:
```sql
WITH OrderYears AS (
  SELECT
    o_orderkey,
    extract(year from o_orderdate) as o_year
  FROM

)
SELECT
  o_year,
  sum(case
    when nation = 'SAUDI ARABIA' then volume
    else 0
  end) / sum(volume) as mkt_share
FROM
  (
    SELECT
      oy.o_year,
      l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount) as volume,
      n2.n_name as nation

      and l_orderkey = oy.o_orderkey
      and o_custkey = c_custkey

      and p_type = 'STANDARD BRUSHED STEEL'

This transformation moves the year extraction out of the main query loop, reducing redundant calculations and potentially improving performance.

"""The SQL query changes can be explained as follows: The original `WHERE` clause contained a condition `o_orderdate between date '1995-01-01' and date '1996-12-31'`. This condition was identified as a candidate for simplification under Case 3 of the query rewrite rule. The rewrite process replaced this condition with a `SEARCH` function, `SEARCH($36(o_orderdate), Sarg[[1995-01-01..1996-12-31]])`, which is a more efficient representation of the same date range filter. This transformation optimizes the query by potentially improving the performance of the date range filter without altering the logical outcome of the query."""

Query Rewrite 2:
"""The SQL query changes can be explained by Case 1 of the query rewrite rule. The original SQL query had several filter conditions in the `WHERE` clause that only involved columns from one side of the respective `INNER JOIN` operations. By moving these conditions into the `ON` clause of the joins, the query optimizer can potentially reduce the size of intermediate datasets before performing the join operations, leading to more efficient query execution. For example, the condition `p_partkey = l_partkey` was moved to the `ON` clause of the join between `part` and `lineitem`, and similarly for other conditions involving `s_suppkey`, `l_orderkey`, `o_custkey`, `c_nationkey`, `n_regionkey`, and `s_nationkey`. This transformation aligns with the rule's transformation of moving conditions into the `ON` clause when they only involve columns from one side of the join."""

Query Rewrite 3:
"""The query uses `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY`, which can be optimized by ensuring that the database engine stops sorting as soon as the required number of rows is obtained. This can be achieved by leveraging indexes on `o_year` if possible, or by ensuring that the sorting operation is efficient. Additionally, the `GROUP BY` operation can be optimized by using indexing strategies or in-memory sorting techniques (`filesort`) to compute group values efficiently. However, since `o_year` is derived from `o_orderdate`, creating an index directly on `o_year` is not straightforward. Instead, ensuring efficient execution of the `GROUP BY` and `ORDER BY` operations through database-specific optimizations is key."""

Query Rewrite 4:
"""The query uses the `extract(year from o_orderdate)` function, which is deterministic and executed for each row. To optimize this, we can pre-calculate the year extraction outside of the main query loop. This can be done by creating a Common Table Expression (CTE) or a subquery that calculates the year once and then uses it in the main query. This reduces the computational overhead of repeatedly extracting the year for each row.

Transformed Query using a CTE:
```sql
WITH OrderYears AS (
  SELECT
    o_orderkey,
    extract(year from o_orderdate) as o_year
  FROM
    orders
  WHERE
    o_orderdate between date '1995-01-01' and date '1996-12-31'
)
SELECT

First, the date range filter in the `WHERE` clause can be simplified by replacing it with a `SEARCH` function, which enhances performance by efficiently handling the date range condition. Second, filter conditions that involve columns from only one side of `INNER JOIN` operations can be moved to the `ON` clause of the joins, reducing the size of intermediate datasets and improving query execution efficiency. Third, the use of `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY` can be optimized by leveraging indexes on `o_year` or ensuring efficient sorting operations, although direct indexing on `o_year` is not straightforward due to its derivation from `o_orderdate`. Lastly, the repeated execution of the `extract(year from o_orderdate)` function can be optimized by pre-calculating the year extraction using a Common Table Expression (CTE) or a subquery, reducing computational overhead and improving performance. These strategies collectively aim to enhance the query\'s efficiency without altering its logical outcome."""\n\nQuery Rewrite Rules:\n### Rule FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains conditions that can be statically determined as always true (e.g., constant expressions like `1=1` or tautologies based on the column data types and constraints), then these conditions don\'t affect the result set.\n**Transformations**: Remove such conditions from the WHERE clause. If this results in an empty WHERE clause, remove the WHERE clause entirely.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause simplifies to conditions that are always false or involve comparisons with NULL in a way that the outcome is always false or NULL (e.g., `column != column` or `1=0`), indicating no rows can satisfy the filter.\n**Transformations**: Replace the query with one that selects no rows. This could be represented in different ways based on the SQL dialect. One universal method might be selecting from a dual table with a false condition.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains complex conditions that can be simplified based on known constraints, constants, or through logical simplification (e.g., `column IS NOT NULL AND column IS NOT NULL` simplifies to `column IS NOT NULL`).\n**Transformations**: Simplify the conditions according to logical rules and known constraints. Remove redundancy and unnecessary complexity."""\n\n### Rule FILTER_INTO_JOIN:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: This SQL query rewrite rule applies when a filter condition is placed on the result set of an INNER JOIN operation. The filter\'s expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there\'s a matching row in the non-preserving side\'s table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned."""\n\n### Rule JOIN_TO_CORRELATE:\n"""**Conditions**: The join type is either INNER JOIN or LEFT JOIN. There are no requirements in the query that would inherently create NULL values on the left side when there are no matching rows on the right side (for INNER JOIN, this condition is naturally met; for LEFT JOIN, it is met if every row on the left side has at least one corresponding row on the right side according to the join condition).\n**Transformations**: 1. Identify the INNER JOIN or LEFT JOIN condition in the SQL query. 2. Extract the ON clause representing the join condition. 3. For INNER JOIN: - Replace the INNER JOIN with a WHERE EXISTS clause, moving the original join condition into the WHERE clause of a subquery that selects from the right side table. Reference the left side columns as correlation variables in the subquery\'s WHERE clause. - Example Transformation: SELECT * FROM left_table INNER JOIN right_table ON left_table.id = right_table.foreign_id Becomes: SELECT * FROM left_table WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM right_table WHERE left_table.id = right_table.foreign_id) 4. For LEFT JOIN: - Replace the LEFT JOIN with a LEFT OUTER JOIN subquery that is correlated to the outer query. In the SELECT clause of the outer query, include a CASE statement or similar logic to handle selection from the subquery result. - Example Transformation: SELECT left_table.*, right_table.* FROM left_table LEFT JOIN right_table ON left_table.id = right_table.foreign_id Becomes: SELECT left_table.*, COALESCE(subquery.alias1, \'default\') FROM left_table LEFT OUTER JOIN (SELECT foreign_id, column1 AS alias1 FROM right_table) subquery ON left_table.id = subquery.foreign_id"""\n\n### Rule AGGREGATE_REDUCE_FUNCTIONS:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: any SELECT statement or subquery using the AVG aggregate function\n**Transformations**: AVG(x) as SUM(x) / COUNT(x)\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: computing the population standard deviation\n**Transformations**: STDDEV_POP(x) as the square root of (`SUM(x^2) - SUM(x)^2 / COUNT(x)`) / COUNT(x)\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: for the sample standard deviation computation\n**Transformations**: STDDEV_SAMP(x) as the square root of (`SUM(x^2) - SUM(x)^2 / COUNT(x)`) / (COUNT(x) - 1)\nCase 4:\n**Conditions**: for the population variance computation\n**Transformations**: VAR_POP(x) as (`SUM(x^2) - SUM(x)^2 / COUNT(x)`) / COUNT(x)\nCase 5:\n**Conditions**: for the sample variance computation\n**Transformations**: VAR_SAMP(x) as (`SUM(x^2) - SUM(x)^2 / COUNT(x)`) / (COUNT(x) - 1)\nCase 6:\n**Conditions**: to compute population covariance\n**Transformations**: COVAR_POP(x, y) by applying a formula involving SUM and COUNT\nCase 7:\n**Conditions**: using a formula for sample covariance\n**Transformations**: COVAR_SAMP(x, y) using a formula involving SUM, COUNT, and an adjustment for sample calculations\nCase 8:\n**Conditions**: for transforming REGR_SXX(x, y) and REGR_SYY(x, y)\n**Transformations**: into expressions involving the computation of VAR_POP(x) or VAR_POP(y) respectively, multiplied by REGR_COUNT(x, y)"""\n\n### Rule PROJECT_FILTER_TRANSPOSE:\n"""**Conditions**: This rewrite rule can be applied when an SQL query contains a SELECT operation (acting as the `Project` operation) followed by a WHERE clause (acting as the `Filter` operation), provided that the SELECT does not contain window functions (such as RANK(), ROW_NUMBER(), etc.) and the columns selected do not affect the outcome of the WHERE clause.\n**Transformations**: To apply the rule, refactor the SQL query so that the conditions in the WHERE clause are evaluated before the columns are selected in the SELECT clause. This may involve moving computations or column transformations from the SELECT clause to a sub-query that the WHERE clause is applied on, ensuring the final SELECT clause on the outermost query matches the original query\'s expected outcome. - Before: SELECT col1, transformation_function(col2) FROM table WHERE condition; - After: SELECT col1, transformation_function(col2) FROM (SELECT col1, col2 FROM table WHERE condition) AS subquery;"""\n\n### Rule SORT_PROJECT_TRANSPOSE:\n"""**Conditions**: If a SQL query executes a sort operation on columns that are directly referenced in the SELECT list or through expressions that are strictly monotonic transformations of these columns, and the sort operation directly follows these projections (SELECT statements), the sort operation can be pushed to operate directly on the table (FROM clause) before the projection.\n**Transformations**: 1. Check Compatibility: Ensure both sort and project (SELECT and ORDER BY clauses) involve compatible operations that relate directly to the raw column data or involve monotonic transformations.\n2. Analyze Order By Fields: Verify that each column in the ORDER BY clause is directly represented in the SELECT list or is a derived column through a monotonic transformation (e.g., casting integers to floats where the order is preserved).\n3. Adjust SQL Query: Rewrite the query so that sorting (ORDER BY clause) is applied to the raw table data in the FROM clause rather than after the projection. This might involve introducing a subquery or CTE (Common Table Expression) where the sorting is applied first, followed by the projections.\n4.

Second, filter conditions that involve columns from only one side of `INNER JOIN` operations can be moved to the `ON` clause of the joins, reducing the size of intermediate datasets and improving query execution efficiency. Third, the use of `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY` can be optimized by leveraging indexes on `o_year` or ensuring efficient sorting operations, although direct indexing on `o_year` is not straightforward due to its derivation from `o_orderdate`. Lastly, the repeated execution of the `extract(year from o_orderdate)` function can be optimized by pre-calculating the year extraction using a Common Table Expression (CTE) or a subquery, reducing computational overhead and improving performance. These strategies collectively aim to enhance the query\'s efficiency without altering its logical outcome."""\n\nQuery Rewrite Rules:\n### Rule FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains conditions that can be statically determined as always true (e.g., constant expressions like `1=1` or tautologies based on the column data types and constraints), then these conditions don\'t affect the result set.\n**Transformations**: Remove such conditions from the WHERE clause. If this results in an empty WHERE clause, remove the WHERE clause entirely.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause simplifies to conditions that are always false or involve comparisons with NULL in a way that the outcome is always false or NULL (e.g., `column != column` or `1=0`), indicating no rows can satisfy the filter.\n**Transformations**: Replace the query with one that selects no rows. This could be represented in different ways based on the SQL dialect. One universal method might be selecting from a dual table with a false condition.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains complex conditions that can be simplified based on known constraints, constants, or through logical simplification (e.g., `column IS NOT NULL AND column IS NOT NULL` simplifies to `column IS NOT NULL`).\n**Transformations**: Simplify the conditions according to logical rules and known constraints. Remove redundancy and unnecessary complexity."""\n\n### Rule FILTER_INTO_JOIN:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: This SQL query rewrite rule applies when a filter condition is placed on the result set of an INNER JOIN operation. The filter\'s expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there\'s a matching row in the non-preserving side\'s table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned."""\n\n### Rule JOIN_TO_CORRELATE:\n"""**Conditions**: The join type is either INNER JOIN or LEFT JOIN. There are no requirements in the query that would inherently create NULL values on the left side when there are no matching rows on the right side (for INNER JOIN, this condition is naturally met; for LEFT JOIN, it is met if every row on the left side has at least one corresponding row on the right side according to the join condition).\n**Transformations**: 1. Identify the INNER JOIN or LEFT JOIN condition in the SQL query. 2. Extract the ON clause representing the join condition. 3. For INNER JOIN: - Replace the INNER JOIN with a WHERE EXISTS clause, moving the original join condition into the WHERE clause of a subquery that selects from the right side table. Reference the left side columns as correlation variables in the subquery\'s WHERE clause. - Example Transformation: SELECT * FROM left_table INNER JOIN right_table ON left_table.id = right_table.foreign_id Becomes: SELECT * FROM left_table WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM right_table WHERE left_table.id = right_table.foreign_id) 4. For LEFT JOIN: - Replace the LEFT JOIN with a LEFT OUTER JOIN subquery that is correlated to the outer query. In the SELECT clause of the outer query, include a CASE statement or similar logic to handle selection from the subquery result. - Example Transformation: SELECT left_table.*, right_table.* FROM left_table LEFT JOIN right_table ON left_table.id = right_table.foreign_id Becomes: SELECT left_table.*, COALESCE(subquery.alias1, \'default\') FROM left_table LEFT OUTER JOIN (SELECT foreign_id, column1 AS alias1 FROM right_table) subquery ON left_table.id = subquery.foreign_id"""\n\n### Rule AGGREGATE_REDUCE_FUNCTIONS:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: any SELECT statement or subquery using the AVG aggregate function\n**Transformations**: AVG(x) as SUM(x) / COUNT(x)\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: computing the population standard deviation\n**Transformations**: STDDEV_POP(x) as the square root of (`SUM(x^2) - SUM(x)^2 / COUNT(x)`) / COUNT(x)\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: for the sample standard deviation computation\n**Transformations**: STDDEV_SAMP(x) as the square root of (`SUM(x^2) - SUM(x)^2 / COUNT(x)`) / (COUNT(x) - 1)\nCase 4:\n**Conditions**: for the population variance computation\n**Transformations**: VAR_POP(x) as (`SUM(x^2) - SUM(x)^2 / COUNT(x)`) / COUNT(x)\nCase 5:\n**Conditions**: for the sample variance computation\n**Transformations**: VAR_SAMP(x) as (`SUM(x^2) - SUM(x)^2 / COUNT(x)`) / (COUNT(x) - 1)\nCase 6:\n**Conditions**: to compute population covariance\n**Transformations**: COVAR_POP(x, y) by applying a formula involving SUM and COUNT\nCase 7:\n**Conditions**: using a formula for sample covariance\n**Transformations**: COVAR_SAMP(x, y) using a formula involving SUM, COUNT, and an adjustment for sample calculations\nCase 8:\n**Conditions**: for transforming REGR_SXX(x, y) and REGR_SYY(x, y)\n**Transformations**: into expressions involving the computation of VAR_POP(x) or VAR_POP(y) respectively, multiplied by REGR_COUNT(x, y)"""\n\n### Rule PROJECT_FILTER_TRANSPOSE:\n"""**Conditions**: This rewrite rule can be applied when an SQL query contains a SELECT operation (acting as the `Project` operation) followed by a WHERE clause (acting as the `Filter` operation), provided that the SELECT does not contain window functions (such as RANK(), ROW_NUMBER(), etc.) and the columns selected do not affect the outcome of the WHERE clause.\n**Transformations**: To apply the rule, refactor the SQL query so that the conditions in the WHERE clause are evaluated before the columns are selected in the SELECT clause.

Remove redundancy and unnecessary complexity."""\n\n### Rule FILTER_INTO_JOIN:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: This SQL query rewrite rule applies when a filter condition is placed on the result set of an INNER JOIN operation. The filter\'s expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there\'s a matching row in the non-preserving side\'s table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned."""\n\n### Rule JOIN_TO_CORRELATE:\n"""**Conditions**: The join type is either INNER JOIN or LEFT JOIN. There are no requirements in the query that would inherently create NULL values on the left side when there are no matching rows on the right side (for INNER JOIN, this condition is naturally met; for LEFT JOIN, it is met if every row on the left side has at least one corresponding row on the right side according to the join condition).\n**Transformations**: 1. Identify the INNER JOIN or LEFT JOIN condition in the SQL query. 2. Extract the ON clause representing the join condition. 3. For INNER JOIN: - Replace the INNER JOIN with a WHERE EXISTS clause, moving the original join condition into the WHERE clause of a subquery that selects from the right side table. Reference the left side columns as correlation variables in the subquery\'s WHERE clause. - Example Transformation: SELECT * FROM left_table INNER JOIN right_table ON left_table.id = right_table.foreign_id Becomes: SELECT * FROM left_table WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM right_table WHERE left_table.id = right_table.foreign_id) 4. For LEFT JOIN: - Replace the LEFT JOIN with a LEFT OUTER JOIN subquery that is correlated to the outer query. In the SELECT clause of the outer query, include a CASE statement or similar logic to handle selection from the subquery result. - Example Transformation: SELECT left_table.*, right_table.* FROM left_table LEFT JOIN right_table ON left_table.id = right_table.foreign_id Becomes: SELECT left_table.*, COALESCE(subquery.alias1, \'default\') FROM left_table LEFT OUTER JOIN (SELECT foreign_id, column1 AS alias1 FROM right_table) subquery ON left_table.id = subquery.foreign_id"""\n\n### Rule AGGREGATE_REDUCE_FUNCTIONS:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: any SELECT statement or subquery using the AVG aggregate function\n**Transformations**: AVG(x) as SUM(x) / COUNT(x)\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: computing the population standard deviation\n**Transformations**: STDDEV_POP(x) as the square root of (`SUM(x^2) - SUM(x)^2 / COUNT(x)`) / COUNT(x)\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: for the sample standard deviation computation\n**Transformations**: STDDEV_SAMP(x) as the square root of (`SUM(x^2) - SUM(x)^2 / COUNT(x)`) / (COUNT(x) - 1)\nCase 4:\n**Conditions**: for the population variance computation\n**Transformations**: VAR_POP(x) as (`SUM(x^2) - SUM(x)^2 / COUNT(x)`) / COUNT(x)\nCase 5:\n**Conditions**: for the sample variance computation\n**Transformations**: VAR_SAMP(x) as (`SUM(x^2) - SUM(x)^2 / COUNT(x)`) / (COUNT(x) - 1)\nCase 6:\n**Conditions**: to compute population covariance\n**Transformations**: COVAR_POP(x, y) by applying a formula involving SUM and COUNT\nCase 7:\n**Conditions**: using a formula for sample covariance\n**Transformations**: COVAR_SAMP(x, y) using a formula involving SUM, COUNT, and an adjustment for sample calculations\nCase 8:\n**Conditions**: for transforming REGR_SXX(x, y) and REGR_SYY(x, y)\n**Transformations**: into expressions involving the computation of VAR_POP(x) or VAR_POP(y) respectively, multiplied by REGR_COUNT(x, y)"""\n\n### Rule PROJECT_FILTER_TRANSPOSE:\n"""**Conditions**: This rewrite rule can be applied when an SQL query contains a SELECT operation (acting as the `Project` operation) followed by a WHERE clause (acting as the `Filter` operation), provided that the SELECT does not contain window functions (such as RANK(), ROW_NUMBER(), etc.) and the columns selected do not affect the outcome of the WHERE clause.\n**Transformations**: To apply the rule, refactor the SQL query so that the conditions in the WHERE clause are evaluated before the columns are selected in the SELECT clause.

The filter\'s expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there\'s a matching row in the non-preserving side\'s table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned."""\n\n### Rule PROJECT_FILTER_TRANSPOSE:\n"""**Conditions**: This rewrite rule can be applied when an SQL query contains a SELECT operation (acting as the `Project` operation) followed by a WHERE clause (acting as the `Filter` operation), provided that the SELECT does not contain window functions (such as RANK(), ROW_NUMBER(), etc.) and the columns selected do not affect the outcome of the WHERE clause.\n**Transformations**: To apply the rule, refactor the SQL query so that the conditions in the WHERE clause are evaluated before the columns are selected in the SELECT clause. This may involve moving computations or column transformations from the SELECT clause to a sub-query that the WHERE clause is applied on, ensuring the final SELECT clause on the outermost query matches the original query\'s expected outcome. - Before: SELECT col1, transformation_function(col2) FROM table WHERE condition; - After: SELECT col1, transformation_function(col2) FROM (SELECT col1, col2 FROM table WHERE condition) AS subquery;"""\n\nRule Subset Sequences:\n### Rule Sequence 1: ["FILTER_INTO_JOIN", "PROJECT_FILTER_TRANSPOSE"]\n\n### Rule Sequence 2: ["FILTER_INTO_JOIN"]\n\n### Rule Sequence 3: ["PROJECT_FILTER_TRANSPOSE"]'}], 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'stream': False, 'temperature': 0.1}}

For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned."""\n\n### Rule PROJECT_FILTER_TRANSPOSE:\n"""**Conditions**: This rewrite rule can be applied when an SQL query contains a SELECT operation (acting as the `Project` operation) followed by a WHERE clause (acting as the `Filter` operation), provided that the SELECT does not contain window functions (such as RANK(), ROW_NUMBER(), etc.) and the columns selected do not affect the outcome of the WHERE clause.\n**Transformations**: To apply the rule, refactor the SQL query so that the conditions in the WHERE clause are evaluated before the columns are selected in the SELECT clause. This may involve moving computations or column transformations from the SELECT clause to a sub-query that the WHERE clause is applied on, ensuring the final SELECT clause on the outermost query matches the original query\'s expected outcome. - Before: SELECT col1, transformation_function(col2) FROM table WHERE condition; - After: SELECT col1, transformation_function(col2) FROM (SELECT col1, col2 FROM table WHERE condition) AS subquery;"""\n\nArranged Rule Sequence: ["FILTER_INTO_JOIN", "PROJECT_FILTER_TRANSPOSE"]\n\nUtilized Rules: ["FILTER_INTO_JOIN"]\n\nUnutilized Rules: ["PROJECT_FILTER_TRANSPOSE"]'}], 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'stream': False, 'temperature': 0.1}}

First, the date range filter in the `WHERE` clause can be simplified by replacing it with a `SEARCH` function, which enhances performance by efficiently handling the date range condition. Second, filter conditions that involve columns from only one side of `INNER JOIN` operations can be moved to the `ON` clause of the joins, reducing the size of intermediate datasets and improving query execution efficiency. Third, the use of `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY` can be optimized by leveraging indexes on `o_year` or ensuring efficient sorting operations, although direct indexing on `o_year` is not straightforward due to its derivation from `o_orderdate`. Lastly, the repeated execution of the `extract(year from o_orderdate)` function can be optimized by pre-calculating the year extraction using a Common Table Expression (CTE) or a subquery, reducing computational overhead and improving performance. These strategies collectively aim to enhance the query\'s efficiency without altering its logical outcome."""\n\nQuery Rewrite Rules:\n### Rule FILTER_INTO_JOIN:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: This SQL query rewrite rule applies when a filter condition is placed on the result set of an INNER JOIN operation. The filter\'s expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there\'s a matching row in the non-preserving side\'s table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned."""\n\n### Rule PROJECT_FILTER_TRANSPOSE:\n"""**Conditions**: This rewrite rule can be applied when an SQL query contains a SELECT operation (acting as the `Project` operation) followed by a WHERE clause (acting as the `Filter` operation), provided that the SELECT does not contain window functions (such as RANK(), ROW_NUMBER(), etc.) and the columns selected do not affect the outcome of the WHERE clause.\n**Transformations**: To apply the rule, refactor the SQL query so that the conditions in the WHERE clause are evaluated before the columns are selected in the SELECT clause.
