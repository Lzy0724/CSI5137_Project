When the `LIMIT` clause is used to fetch a specified number of rows.\n2. When `ORDER BY` is used in conjunction with `LIMIT` to sort and limit the number of rows retrieved, particularly when sorting can leverage an index.\n3. When `DISTINCT` is used along with `LIMIT` to quickly identify and return unique rows without scanning the full dataset.\n4. During the use of `GROUP BY`, where optimization might involve sorting or traversing indexes in order to efficiently compute group values without processing the entire dataset.\n5. When sorting a specific number of rows from a single table based on non-indexed columns, utilizing in-memory sorting (`filesort`) techniques.\n**Transformations**: The specific SQL transformations that emerge from applying these optimization rules are:\n1. Combining `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY` encourages the database engine to stop the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained, avoiding full table sorts.\n2. Using `LIMIT` with `DISTINCT` leads to an early termination of the search for unique rows as soon as the needed amount is gathered, reducing time and resources spent on scanning the entire dataset.\n3. In the context of `GROUP BY`, optimizations may include indexing strategies or modifications to the way sorting is handled, such as employing `filesort` mechanisms that do not require temporary tables, ensuring that the database engine processes only the necessary data for group computations.\n4. Efficiencies are gained by encouraging the use of indexed columns with `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT`, making queries more efficient by reducing the cost associated with sorting and filtering operations.\n"""\nRule 3:\n"""\n**Conditions**: The SQL query rewrite rule applies when there are:\n- Functions or operations (especially deterministic ones) within the SELECT, WHERE, JOIN conditions, or any part of the query that is executed multiple times for the same row.\n- The presence of potentially computationally expensive operations or function calls that are not dependent on the data of the specific row and thus can be optimized.\n**Transformations**: 1. Move repeated function calls or operations outside of loops, if applicable. For example, if a function that generates a calculated value based on constants or parameters (not row-specific data) is being called in a loop, calculate the value once before the loop and store the result for reuse.\n   \n2. Replace inline functions in the SELECT or WHERE clause with a pre-calculated column if the function is deterministic and the input data does not change frequently. This might involve:\n   - Creating a temporary table that includes the results of the expensive function calls.\n   - Using a subquery or a Common Table Expression (CTE) that calculates the value once and then joins it with the main query.\n   \n3. When using aggregate functions that are called multiple times with the same parameters, consider storing the result in a variable or a temporary table, especially if the data set is large.\n\n4. Avoid using functions on indexed columns in the WHERE clause. This prevents the database from using the index efficiently. If a function must be used, consider creating a computed column that pre-calculates the function\'s result and index that column instead.\n\n5. If possible, simplify expressions and calculations to reduce their complexity and execution time. This might involve algebraic simplification or breaking down complex calculations into simpler parts that can be calculated separately and then combined.\n\nExample:\nOriginal Query:\n```sql\nSELECT id, name, expensive_function(column) as expensive_result\nFROM table\nWHERE expensive_function(column) > 100;\n```\n\nTransformed Query using a CTE:\n```sql\nWITH PreCalculated AS (\n  SELECT id, name, column, expensive_function(column) as expensive_result\n  FROM table\n)\nSELECT id, name, expensive_sel as expensive_result\nFROM PreCalculated\nWHERE expensive_result > 100;\n```\n"""'}], 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'stream': False, 'temperature': 0.1}}

The filter's expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there's a matching row in the non-preserving side's table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned.\n```\n\nLogical Plan Changes After Rewrite: ```\n  LogicalSort(sort0=[$1], sort1=[$2(o_orderdate)], dir0=[DESC], dir1=[ASC], fetch=[10])\r\n    LogicalProject(l_orderkey=[$0(l_orderkey)], revenue=[$3], o_orderdate=[$1(o_orderdate)], o_shippriority=[$2(o_shippriority)])\r\n      LogicalAggregate(group=[{0, 1, 2}], revenue=[SUM($3)])\r\n        LogicalProject(l_orderkey=[$17(l_orderkey)], o_orderdate=[$12(o_orderdate)], o_shippriority=[$15(o_shippriority)], $f3=[*($22(l_extendedprice), -(1, $23(l_discount)))])\r\n-         LogicalFilter(condition=[AND(=(CAST($6(c_mktsegment)):CHAR(9) NOT NULL, 'MACHINERY'), =($0(c_custkey), $9(o_custkey)), =($17(l_orderkey), $8(o_orderkey)), <($12(o_orderdate), 1995-03-13), >($27(l_shipdate), 1995-03-13))])\r\n+         LogicalJoin(condition=[=($17(l_orderkey), $8(o_orderkey))], joinType=[inner])\r\n-           LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n?                                   ^\n\n+           LogicalJoin(condition=[=($0(c_custkey), $9(o_custkey))], joinType=[inner])\r\n?                                  ++++++++++ ^^^^^^^^^^^^ +++ +++\n\n-             LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n+             LogicalFilter(condition=[=(CAST($6(c_mktsegment)):CHAR(9) NOT NULL, 'MACHINERY')])\r\n                LogicalTableScan(table=[[customer]])\r\n+             LogicalFilter(condition=[<($4(o_orderdate), 1995-03-13)])\r\n                LogicalTableScan(table=[[orders]])\r\n+           LogicalFilter(condition=[>($10(l_shipdate), 1995-03-13)])\r\n              LogicalTableScan(table=[[lineitem]])\r\n  \n```"}], 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'stream': False, 'temperature': 0.1}}

For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned.\n```\n\nLogical Plan Changes After Rewrite: ```\n  LogicalSort(sort0=[$1], sort1=[$2(o_orderdate)], dir0=[DESC], dir1=[ASC], fetch=[10])\r\n    LogicalProject(l_orderkey=[$0(l_orderkey)], revenue=[$3], o_orderdate=[$1(o_orderdate)], o_shippriority=[$2(o_shippriority)])\r\n      LogicalAggregate(group=[{0, 1, 2}], revenue=[SUM($3)])\r\n        LogicalProject(l_orderkey=[$17(l_orderkey)], o_orderdate=[$12(o_orderdate)], o_shippriority=[$15(o_shippriority)], $f3=[*($22(l_extendedprice), -(1, $23(l_discount)))])\r\n-         LogicalFilter(condition=[AND(=(CAST($6(c_mktsegment)):CHAR(9) NOT NULL, 'MACHINERY'), =($0(c_custkey), $9(o_custkey)), =($17(l_orderkey), $8(o_orderkey)), <($12(o_orderdate), 1995-03-13), >($27(l_shipdate), 1995-03-13))])\r\n+         LogicalJoin(condition=[=($17(l_orderkey), $8(o_orderkey))], joinType=[inner])\r\n-           LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n?                                   ^\n\n+           LogicalJoin(condition=[=($0(c_custkey), $9(o_custkey))], joinType=[inner])\r\n?                                  ++++++++++ ^^^^^^^^^^^^ +++ +++\n\n-             LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n+             LogicalFilter(condition=[=(CAST($6(c_mktsegment)):CHAR(9) NOT NULL, 'MACHINERY')])\r\n                LogicalTableScan(table=[[customer]])\r\n+             LogicalFilter(condition=[<($4(o_orderdate), 1995-03-13)])\r\n                LogicalTableScan(table=[[orders]])\r\n+           LogicalFilter(condition=[>($10(l_shipdate), 1995-03-13)])\r\n              LogicalTableScan(table=[[lineitem]])\r\n  \n```"}], 'response': "Step 1: The logical plan changes indicate that the original SQL query's filter conditions, which were initially applied in a `LogicalFilter` node, have been pushed down into the `LogicalJoin` and `LogicalFilter` nodes associated with individual tables. Specifically, the conditions `c_mktsegment = 'MACHINERY'`, `o_orderdate < date '1995-03-13'`, and `l_shipdate > date '1995-03-13'` have been moved to separate `LogicalFilter` nodes that are applied directly to the `customer`, `orders`, and `lineitem` tables, respectively. Additionally, the join conditions `c_custkey = o_custkey` and `l_orderkey = o_orderkey` have been incorporated into the `LogicalJoin` nodes.\n\nStep 2: Parsing the logical plan changes, we observe the following detailed changes:\n- The condition `c_mktsegment = 'MACHINERY'` is now applied as a filter directly on the `customer` table.\n- The condition `o_orderdate < date '1995-03-13'` is now applied as a filter directly on the `orders` table.\n- The condition `l_shipdate > date '1995-03-13'` is now applied as a filter directly on the `lineitem` table.\n- The join condition `c_custkey = o_custkey` is now part of the `LogicalJoin` between `customer` and `orders`.\n- The join condition `l_orderkey = o_orderkey` is now part of the `LogicalJoin` between the result of the previous join and `lineitem`.\n\nStep 3: The query rewrite rule contains multiple cases. In this scenario, the changes match Case 1 of the query rewrite rule. This case applies when a filter condition is placed on the result set of an INNER JOIN operation, and the filter's expressions can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs. The conditions `c_mktsegment = 'MACHINERY'`, `o_orderdate < date '1995-03-13'`, and `l_shipdate > date '1995-03-13'` are applied to individual tables before the join, which aligns with the transformation described in Case 1.\n\nStep 4: The SQL query changes can be explained as follows: The original query applied several filter conditions in the `WHERE` clause after performing joins between the `customer`, `orders`, and `lineitem` tables. By applying Case 1 of the query rewrite rule, these filter conditions were pushed down to the individual tables before the join operations. This optimization reduces the size of the datasets involved in the joins, potentially improving query performance. Specifically, the condition `c_mktsegment = 'MACHINERY'` is applied directly to the `customer` table, `o_orderdate < date '1995-03-13'` is applied to the `orders` table, and `l_shipdate > date '1995-03-13'` is applied to the `lineitem` table. The join conditions are incorporated into the `LogicalJoin` nodes, ensuring that only relevant rows are joined, further optimizing the query execution.", 'time': 5.7075700759887695}

When the `LIMIT` clause is used to fetch a specified number of rows.\n2. When `ORDER BY` is used in conjunction with `LIMIT` to sort and limit the number of rows retrieved, particularly when sorting can leverage an index.\n3. When `DISTINCT` is used along with `LIMIT` to quickly identify and return unique rows without scanning the full dataset.\n4. During the use of `GROUP BY`, where optimization might involve sorting or traversing indexes in order to efficiently compute group values without processing the entire dataset.\n5. When sorting a specific number of rows from a single table based on non-indexed columns, utilizing in-memory sorting (`filesort`) techniques.\n**Transformations**: The specific SQL transformations that emerge from applying these optimization rules are:\n1. Combining `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY` encourages the database engine to stop the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained, avoiding full table sorts.\n2. Using `LIMIT` with `DISTINCT` leads to an early termination of the search for unique rows as soon as the needed amount is gathered, reducing time and resources spent on scanning the entire dataset.\n3. In the context of `GROUP BY`, optimizations may include indexing strategies or modifications to the way sorting is handled, such as employing `filesort` mechanisms that do not require temporary tables, ensuring that the database engine processes only the necessary data for group computations.\n4. Efficiencies are gained by encouraging the use of indexed columns with `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT`, making queries more efficient by reducing the cost associated with sorting and filtering operations.\n"""\nRule 3:\n"""\n**Conditions**: The SQL query rewrite rule applies when there are:\n- Functions or operations (especially deterministic ones) within the SELECT, WHERE, JOIN conditions, or any part of the query that is executed multiple times for the same row.\n- The presence of potentially computationally expensive operations or function calls that are not dependent on the data of the specific row and thus can be optimized.\n**Transformations**: 1. Move repeated function calls or operations outside of loops, if applicable. For example, if a function that generates a calculated value based on constants or parameters (not row-specific data) is being called in a loop, calculate the value once before the loop and store the result for reuse.\n   \n2. Replace inline functions in the SELECT or WHERE clause with a pre-calculated column if the function is deterministic and the input data does not change frequently. This might involve:\n   - Creating a temporary table that includes the results of the expensive function calls.\n   - Using a subquery or a Common Table Expression (CTE) that calculates the value once and then joins it with the main query.\n   \n3. When using aggregate functions that are called multiple times with the same parameters, consider storing the result in a variable or a temporary table, especially if the data set is large.\n\n4. Avoid using functions on indexed columns in the WHERE clause. This prevents the database from using the index efficiently. If a function must be used, consider creating a computed column that pre-calculates the function\'s result and index that column instead.\n\n5. If possible, simplify expressions and calculations to reduce their complexity and execution time. This might involve algebraic simplification or breaking down complex calculations into simpler parts that can be calculated separately and then combined.\n\nExample:\nOriginal Query:\n```sql\nSELECT id, name, expensive_function(column) as expensive_result\nFROM table\nWHERE expensive_function(column) > 100;\n```\n\nTransformed Query using a CTE:\n```sql\nWITH PreCalculated AS (\n  SELECT id, name, column, expensive_function(column) as expensive_result\n  FROM table\n)\nSELECT id, name, expensive_sel as expensive_result\nFROM PreCalculated\nWHERE expensive_result > 100;\n```\n"""'}], 'response': 'Step 1: Analyze the given SQL query against each rule\'s conditions to determine applicability.\n\n- **Rule 1 Conditions**: \n  - The query performs a `GROUP BY` operation and involves `JOIN` operations between `customer`, `orders`, and `lineitem`.\n  - The query could benefit from reducing the size of intermediate datasets, especially since it involves multiple tables.\n  - The query involves operations that could be reordered for performance improvements.\n  - Therefore, Rule 1 matches the SQL query.\n\n- **Rule 2 Conditions**:\n  - The query uses `LIMIT` in conjunction with `ORDER BY`, which matches condition 1.\n  - The query involves `GROUP BY`, which matches condition 4.\n  - The query does not use `DISTINCT`, so condition 3 does not apply.\n  - The query sorts based on `revenue` and `o_orderdate`, but it is not specified if these are indexed columns.\n  - Therefore, Rule 2 matches the SQL query.\n\n- **Rule 3 Conditions**:\n  - The query involves a calculation `sum(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount))` in the `SELECT` clause.\n  - This calculation is not repeated in other parts of the query, and it is dependent on row-specific data.\n  - There are no other functions or operations in the query that are executed multiple times for the same row.\n  - Therefore, Rule 3 does not match the SQL query.\n\nStep 2: Apply the transformations from the matched rules to the SQL query.\n\nQuery Rewrite 1:\n"""\nThe original query performs `JOIN` operations before the `GROUP BY`.

03:13:03,360 root INFO Generated queries:
Query 1: The SQL query changes can be explained as follows: The original query applied several filter conditions in the `WHERE` clause after performing joins between the `customer`, `orders`, and `lineitem` tables. By applying Case 1 of the query rewrite rule, these filter conditions were pushed down to the individual tables before the join operations. This optimization reduces the size of the datasets involved in the joins, potentially improving query performance. Specifically, the condition `c_mktsegment = 'MACHINERY'` is applied directly to the `customer` table, `o_orderdate < date '1995-03-13'` is applied to the `orders` table, and `l_shipdate > date '1995-03-13'` is applied to the `lineitem` table. The join conditions are incorporated into the `LogicalJoin` nodes, ensuring that only relevant rows are joined, further optimizing the query execution.
Query 2: The original query performs `JOIN` operations before the `GROUP BY`. According to Rule 1, we can optimize the query by performing `GROUP BY` operations earlier to reduce the dataset size before joining. We can use subqueries to pre-aggregate data from the `lineitem` table, which is the largest table, before joining with `orders` and `customer`.

Transformed Query:
```sql
WITH PreAggregatedLineitem AS (
  SELECT
    l_orderkey,
    sum(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)) as revenue
  FROM
    lineitem
  WHERE
    l_shipdate > date '1995-03-13'
  GROUP BY
    l_orderkey
)
SELECT
  l.l_orderkey,
  l.revenue,
  o.o_orderdate,
  o.o_shippriority
FROM
  PreAggregatedLineitem l
JOIN
  orders o ON l.l_orderkey = o.o_orderkey
JOIN
  customer c ON c.c_custkey = o.o_custkey
WHERE
  c.c_mktsegment = 'MACHINERY'
  AND o.o_orderdate < date '1995-03-13'
ORDER BY
  l.revenue desc,
  o.o_orderdate
LIMIT 10;
```
This transformation reduces the size of the `lineitem` dataset before joining, potentially improving performance.
Query 3: The query uses `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY`, which can be optimized by ensuring that the database engine stops sorting as soon as the required number of rows is obtained. This can be achieved by ensuring that the sorting columns (`revenue` and `o_orderdate`) are indexed, if possible, to leverage index-based sorting.

Transformed Query:
```sql
-- Assuming indexes exist on (revenue, o_orderdate) for efficient sorting
SELECT
  l_orderkey,
  sum(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)) as revenue,
  o_orderdate,
  o_shippriority
FROM
  customer,
  orders,
  lineitem
WHERE
  c_mktsegment = 'MACHINERY'
  AND c_custkey = o_custkey
  AND l_orderkey = o_orderkey
  AND o_orderdate < date '1995-03-13'
  AND l_shipdate > date '1995-03-13'
GROUP BY
  l_orderkey,
  o_orderdate,
  o_shippriority
ORDER BY
  revenue desc,
  o_orderdate
LIMIT 10;
```
This transformation suggests ensuring indexes on the sorting columns to optimize the `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT` operations.

"""The SQL query changes can be explained as follows: The original query applied several filter conditions in the `WHERE` clause after performing joins between the `customer`, `orders`, and `lineitem` tables. By applying Case 1 of the query rewrite rule, these filter conditions were pushed down to the individual tables before the join operations. This optimization reduces the size of the datasets involved in the joins, potentially improving query performance. Specifically, the condition `c_mktsegment = 'MACHINERY'` is applied directly to the `customer` table, `o_orderdate < date '1995-03-13'` is applied to the `orders` table, and `l_shipdate > date '1995-03-13'` is applied to the `lineitem` table. The join conditions are incorporated into the `LogicalJoin` nodes, ensuring that only relevant rows are joined, further optimizing the query execution."""

"""The original query performs `JOIN` operations before the `GROUP BY`. According to Rule 1, we can optimize the query by performing `GROUP BY` operations earlier to reduce the dataset size before joining.

The first strategy involves pushing filter conditions down to individual tables before performing join operations, which reduces the dataset size involved in the joins and enhances query performance. Specifically, conditions like `c_mktsegment = \'MACHINERY\'`, `o_orderdate < date \'1995-03-13\'`, and `l_shipdate > date \'1995-03-13\'` are applied directly to the `customer`, `orders`, and `lineitem` tables, respectively. The second strategy suggests performing `GROUP BY` operations earlier by using subqueries to pre-aggregate data from the largest table, `lineitem`, before joining it with `orders` and `customer`, thereby reducing the dataset size before the join. The third strategy focuses on optimizing the `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT` operations by ensuring that the sorting columns (`revenue` and `o_orderdate`) are indexed, allowing the database engine to stop sorting as soon as the required number of rows is obtained, thus improving efficiency."""\n\nQuery Rewrite Rules:\n### Rule FILTER_INTO_JOIN:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: This SQL query rewrite rule applies when a filter condition is placed on the result set of an INNER JOIN operation. The filter\'s expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there\'s a matching row in the non-preserving side\'s table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned."""\n\n### Rule JOIN_TO_CORRELATE:\n"""**Conditions**: The join type is either INNER JOIN or LEFT JOIN. There are no requirements in the query that would inherently create NULL values on the left side when there are no matching rows on the right side (for INNER JOIN, this condition is naturally met; for LEFT JOIN, it is met if every row on the left side has at least one corresponding row on the right side according to the join condition).\n**Transformations**: 1. Identify the INNER JOIN or LEFT JOIN condition in the SQL query. 2. Extract the ON clause representing the join condition. 3. For INNER JOIN: - Replace the INNER JOIN with a WHERE EXISTS clause, moving the original join condition into the WHERE clause of a subquery that selects from the right side table.

Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there\'s a matching row in the non-preserving side\'s table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side.

The filter\'s expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there\'s a matching row in the non-preserving side\'s table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned."""\n\nArranged Rule Sequence: ["FILTER_INTO_JOIN"]\n\nUtilized Rules: ["FILTER_INTO_JOIN"]\n\nUnutilized Rules: []'}], 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'stream': False, 'temperature': 0.1}}
