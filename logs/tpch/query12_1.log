When the `LIMIT` clause is used to fetch a specified number of rows.\n2. When `ORDER BY` is used in conjunction with `LIMIT` to sort and limit the number of rows retrieved, particularly when sorting can leverage an index.\n3. When `DISTINCT` is used along with `LIMIT` to quickly identify and return unique rows without scanning the full dataset.\n4. During the use of `GROUP BY`, where optimization might involve sorting or traversing indexes in order to efficiently compute group values without processing the entire dataset.\n5. When sorting a specific number of rows from a single table based on non-indexed columns, utilizing in-memory sorting (`filesort`) techniques.\n**Transformations**: The specific SQL transformations that emerge from applying these optimization rules are:\n1. Combining `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY` encourages the database engine to stop the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained, avoiding full table sorts.\n2. Using `LIMIT` with `DISTINCT` leads to an early termination of the search for unique rows as soon as the needed amount is gathered, reducing time and resources spent on scanning the entire dataset.\n3. In the context of `GROUP BY`, optimizations may include indexing strategies or modifications to the way sorting is handled, such as employing `filesort` mechanisms that do not require temporary tables, ensuring that the database engine processes only the necessary data for group computations.\n4. Efficiencies are gained by encouraging the use of indexed columns with `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT`, making queries more efficient by reducing the cost associated with sorting and filtering operations.\n"""\nRule 4:\n"""\n**Conditions**: The SQL query rewrite rule applies when there are:\n- Functions or operations (especially deterministic ones) within the SELECT, WHERE, JOIN conditions, or any part of the query that is executed multiple times for the same row.\n- The presence of potentially computationally expensive operations or function calls that are not dependent on the data of the specific row and thus can be optimized.\n**Transformations**: 1. Move repeated function calls or operations outside of loops, if applicable. For example, if a function that generates a calculated value based on constants or parameters (not row-specific data) is being called in a loop, calculate the value once before the loop and store the result for reuse.\n   \n2. Replace inline functions in the SELECT or WHERE clause with a pre-calculated column if the function is deterministic and the input data does not change frequently. This might involve:\n   - Creating a temporary table that includes the results of the expensive function calls.\n   - Using a subquery or a Common Table Expression (CTE) that calculates the value once and then joins it with the main query.\n   \n3. When using aggregate functions that are called multiple times with the same parameters, consider storing the result in a variable or a temporary table, especially if the data set is large.\n\n4. Avoid using functions on indexed columns in the WHERE clause. This prevents the database from using the index efficiently. If a function must be used, consider creating a computed column that pre-calculates the function\'s result and index that column instead.\n\n5. If possible, simplify expressions and calculations to reduce their complexity and execution time. This might involve algebraic simplification or breaking down complex calculations into simpler parts that can be calculated separately and then combined.\n\nExample:\nOriginal Query:\n```sql\nSELECT id, name, expensive_function(column) as expensive_result\nFROM table\nWHERE expensive_function(column) > 100;\n```\n\nTransformed Query using a CTE:\n```sql\nWITH PreCalculated AS (\n  SELECT id, name, column, expensive_function(column) as expensive_result\n  FROM table\n)\nSELECT id, name, expensive_sel as expensive_result\nFROM PreCalculated\nWHERE expensive_result > 100;\n```\n"""'}], 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'stream': False, 'temperature': 0.1}}

The filter's expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there's a matching row in the non-preserving side's table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned.\n```\n\nLogical Plan Changes After Rewrite: ```\n  LogicalSort(sort0=[$0(l_shipmode)], dir0=[ASC], fetch=[1])\r\n    LogicalAggregate(group=[{0}], high_line_count=[SUM($1)], low_line_count=[SUM($2)])\r\n      LogicalProject(l_shipmode=[$23(l_shipmode)], $f1=[CASE(OR(=(CAST($5(o_orderpriority)):CHAR(8) NOT NULL, '1-URGENT'), =(CAST($5(o_orderpriority)):CHAR(6) NOT NULL, '2-HIGH')), 1, 0)], $f2=[CASE(AND(<>(CAST($5(o_orderpriority)):CHAR(8) NOT NULL, '1-URGENT'), <>(CAST($5(o_orderpriority)):CHAR(6) NOT NULL, '2-HIGH')), 1, 0)])\r\n+       LogicalJoin(condition=[=($0(o_orderkey), $9(l_orderkey))], joinType=[inner])\r\n-       LogicalFilter(condition=[AND(=($0(o_orderkey), $9(l_orderkey)), OR(=(CAST($23(l_shipmode)):CHAR(3) NOT NULL, 'FOB'), =(CAST($23(l_shipmode)):CHAR(4) NOT NULL, 'RAIL')), <($20(l_commitdate), $21(l_receiptdate)), <($19(l_shipdate), $20(l_commitdate)), >=($21(l_receiptdate), 1996-01-01), <($21(l_receiptdate), +(1996-01-01, 12:INTERVAL YEAR)))])\r\n-         LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n-           LogicalTableScan(table=[[orders]])\r\n? --\n\n+         LogicalTableScan(table=[[orders]])\r\n+         LogicalFilter(condition=[AND(OR(=(CAST($14(l_shipmode)):CHAR(3) NOT NULL, 'FOB'), =(CAST($14(l_shipmode)):CHAR(4) NOT NULL, 'RAIL')), <($11(l_commitdate), $12(l_receiptdate)), <($10(l_shipdate), $11(l_commitdate)), >=($12(l_receiptdate), 1996-01-01), <($12(l_receiptdate), +(1996-01-01, 12:INTERVAL YEAR)))])\r\n            LogicalTableScan(table=[[lineitem]])\r\n  \n```"}], 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'stream': False, 'temperature': 0.1}}

The filter's expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there's a matching row in the non-preserving side's table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned.\n```\n\nLogical Plan Changes After Rewrite: ```\n  LogicalSort(sort0=[$0(l_shipmode)], dir0=[ASC], fetch=[1])\r\n    LogicalAggregate(group=[{0}], high_line_count=[SUM($1)], low_line_count=[SUM($2)])\r\n      LogicalProject(l_shipmode=[$23(l_shipmode)], $f1=[CASE(OR(=(CAST($5(o_orderpriority)):CHAR(8) NOT NULL, '1-URGENT'), =(CAST($5(o_orderpriority)):CHAR(6) NOT NULL, '2-HIGH')), 1, 0)], $f2=[CASE(AND(<>(CAST($5(o_orderpriority)):CHAR(8) NOT NULL, '1-URGENT'), <>(CAST($5(o_orderpriority)):CHAR(6) NOT NULL, '2-HIGH')), 1, 0)])\r\n+       LogicalJoin(condition=[=($0(o_orderkey), $9(l_orderkey))], joinType=[inner])\r\n-       LogicalFilter(condition=[AND(=($0(o_orderkey), $9(l_orderkey)), OR(=(CAST($23(l_shipmode)):CHAR(3) NOT NULL, 'FOB'), =(CAST($23(l_shipmode)):CHAR(4) NOT NULL, 'RAIL')), <($20(l_commitdate), $21(l_receiptdate)), <($19(l_shipdate), $20(l_commitdate)), >=($21(l_receiptdate), 1996-01-01), <($21(l_receiptdate), +(1996-01-01, 12:INTERVAL YEAR)))])\r\n-         LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n-           LogicalTableScan(table=[[orders]])\r\n? --\n\n+         LogicalTableScan(table=[[orders]])\r\n+         LogicalFilter(condition=[AND(OR(=(CAST($14(l_shipmode)):CHAR(3) NOT NULL, 'FOB'), =(CAST($14(l_shipmode)):CHAR(4) NOT NULL, 'RAIL')), <($11(l_commitdate), $12(l_receiptdate)), <($10(l_shipdate), $11(l_commitdate)), >=($12(l_receiptdate), 1996-01-01), <($12(l_receiptdate), +(1996-01-01, 12:INTERVAL YEAR)))])\r\n            LogicalTableScan(table=[[lineitem]])\r\n  \n```"}], 'response': "Step 1: The logical plan changes indicate that the query rewrite rule has moved certain filter conditions from a `LogicalFilter` node that was applied after a `LogicalJoin` to a `LogicalFilter` node applied directly to the `lineitem` table before the join.

These conditions only involve columns from the `lineitem` table. The rewrite has moved these conditions to a `LogicalFilter` applied directly to the `lineitem` table, effectively filtering `lineitem` before it is joined with `orders`.\n\nStep 3: The query rewrite rule contains multiple cases. In this scenario, Case 1 is applicable. The conditions in the `WHERE` clause of the original query only involve columns from the `lineitem` table, which is one side of the join. According to Case 1, such conditions can be moved to filter the `lineitem` table before the join, which is exactly what has been done in the rewrite.\n\nStep 4: The SQL query changes can be explained by Case 1 of the query rewrite rule. The original query had a `WHERE` clause with conditions `l_shipmode in ('FOB', 'RAIL')`, `l_commitdate < l_receiptdate`, `l_shipdate < l_commitdate`, `l_receiptdate >= date '1996-01-01'`, and `l_receiptdate < date '1996-01-01' + interval '1' year`. These conditions only involve columns from the `lineitem` table. By moving these conditions to filter `lineitem` before the join, the query becomes more efficient as it reduces the size of the `lineitem` dataset before performing the join with `orders`. This transformation aligns with the rule's guidance to apply filters to the relevant side of the join when possible, optimizing the query execution.", 'time': 4.730693817138672}

When the `LIMIT` clause is used to fetch a specified number of rows.\n2. When `ORDER BY` is used in conjunction with `LIMIT` to sort and limit the number of rows retrieved, particularly when sorting can leverage an index.\n3. When `DISTINCT` is used along with `LIMIT` to quickly identify and return unique rows without scanning the full dataset.\n4. During the use of `GROUP BY`, where optimization might involve sorting or traversing indexes in order to efficiently compute group values without processing the entire dataset.\n5. When sorting a specific number of rows from a single table based on non-indexed columns, utilizing in-memory sorting (`filesort`) techniques.\n**Transformations**: The specific SQL transformations that emerge from applying these optimization rules are:\n1. Combining `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY` encourages the database engine to stop the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained, avoiding full table sorts.\n2. Using `LIMIT` with `DISTINCT` leads to an early termination of the search for unique rows as soon as the needed amount is gathered, reducing time and resources spent on scanning the entire dataset.\n3. In the context of `GROUP BY`, optimizations may include indexing strategies or modifications to the way sorting is handled, such as employing `filesort` mechanisms that do not require temporary tables, ensuring that the database engine processes only the necessary data for group computations.\n4. Efficiencies are gained by encouraging the use of indexed columns with `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT`, making queries more efficient by reducing the cost associated with sorting and filtering operations.\n"""\nRule 4:\n"""\n**Conditions**: The SQL query rewrite rule applies when there are:\n- Functions or operations (especially deterministic ones) within the SELECT, WHERE, JOIN conditions, or any part of the query that is executed multiple times for the same row.\n- The presence of potentially computationally expensive operations or function calls that are not dependent on the data of the specific row and thus can be optimized.\n**Transformations**: 1. Move repeated function calls or operations outside of loops, if applicable. For example, if a function that generates a calculated value based on constants or parameters (not row-specific data) is being called in a loop, calculate the value once before the loop and store the result for reuse.\n   \n2. Replace inline functions in the SELECT or WHERE clause with a pre-calculated column if the function is deterministic and the input data does not change frequently. This might involve:\n   - Creating a temporary table that includes the results of the expensive function calls.\n   - Using a subquery or a Common Table Expression (CTE) that calculates the value once and then joins it with the main query.\n   \n3. When using aggregate functions that are called multiple times with the same parameters, consider storing the result in a variable or a temporary table, especially if the data set is large.\n\n4. Avoid using functions on indexed columns in the WHERE clause. This prevents the database from using the index efficiently. If a function must be used, consider creating a computed column that pre-calculates the function\'s result and index that column instead.\n\n5. If possible, simplify expressions and calculations to reduce their complexity and execution time. This might involve algebraic simplification or breaking down complex calculations into simpler parts that can be calculated separately and then combined.\n\nExample:\nOriginal Query:\n```sql\nSELECT id, name, expensive_function(column) as expensive_result\nFROM table\nWHERE expensive_function(column) > 100;\n```\n\nTransformed Query using a CTE:\n```sql\nWITH PreCalculated AS (\n  SELECT id, name, column, expensive_function(column) as expensive_result\n  FROM table\n)\nSELECT id, name, expensive_sel as expensive_result\nFROM PreCalculated\nWHERE expensive_result > 100;\n```\n"""'}], 'response': 'Step 1: Analyze the given SQL query against each provided rewrite rule to determine applicability.\n\n- **Rule 1**: The query does not use NOT EXISTS, NOT IN, EXISTS, IN, or OR within JOINs and WHERE clauses.

02:40:30,56 root INFO Generated queries:
Query 1: The SQL query changes can be explained by Case 1 of the query rewrite rule. The original query had a `WHERE` clause with conditions `l_shipmode in ('FOB', 'RAIL')`, `l_commitdate < l_receiptdate`, `l_shipdate < l_commitdate`, `l_receiptdate >= date '1996-01-01'`, and `l_receiptdate < date '1996-01-01' + interval '1' year`. These conditions only involve columns from the `lineitem` table. By moving these conditions to filter `lineitem` before the join, the query becomes more efficient as it reduces the size of the `lineitem` dataset before performing the join with `orders`. This transformation aligns with the rule's guidance to apply filters to the relevant side of the join when possible, optimizing the query execution.
Query 2: The SQL query changes can be explained by the application of Case 3 of the query rewrite rule. The original conditions `l_receiptdate >= date '1996-01-01'` and `l_receiptdate < date '1996-01-01' + interval '1' year` were logically simplified to `SEARCH($21(l_receiptdate), Sarg[[1996-01-01..1997-01-01)])`. This transformation reduces redundancy and complexity by consolidating the two separate date conditions into a single, more efficient search condition. This simplification does not alter the semantics of the query but optimizes the execution by potentially allowing the database engine to use more efficient index-based retrieval methods.
Query 3: The SQL query performs a `GROUP BY` operation after a `JOIN`. According to Rule 2, we can optimize the query by performing the `GROUP BY` operation earlier to reduce the size of intermediate datasets. This can be achieved by using a subquery to pre-aggregate the data before joining:

Original Query:
```sql
select
	l_shipmode,
	sum(case
		when o_orderpriority = '1-URGENT'
			or o_orderpriority = '2-HIGH'
			then 1
		else 0
	end) as high_line_count,
	sum(case
		when o_orderpriority <> '1-URGENT'
			and o_orderpriority <> '2-HIGH'
			then 1
		else 0
	end) as low_line_count
from
	orders,
	lineitem
where
	o_orderkey = l_orderkey
	and l_shipmode in ('FOB', 'RAIL')
	and l_commitdate < l_receiptdate

Transformed Query:
```sql

	sum(high_priority) as high_line_count,
	sum(low_priority) as low_line_count
from (
	select
		l_shipmode,
		case
			when o_orderpriority = '1-URGENT'
				or o_orderpriority = '2-HIGH'

This transformation reduces the dataset size before the final aggregation, potentially improving performance.

"""The SQL query changes can be explained by Case 1 of the query rewrite rule. The original query had a `WHERE` clause with conditions `l_shipmode in ('FOB', 'RAIL')`, `l_commitdate < l_receiptdate`, `l_shipdate < l_commitdate`, `l_receiptdate >= date '1996-01-01'`, and `l_receiptdate < date '1996-01-01' + interval '1' year`. These conditions only involve columns from the `lineitem` table. By moving these conditions to filter `lineitem` before the join, the query becomes more efficient as it reduces the size of the `lineitem` dataset before performing the join with `orders`. This transformation aligns with the rule's guidance to apply filters to the relevant side of the join when possible, optimizing the query execution."""

The original conditions `l_receiptdate >= date '1996-01-01'` and `l_receiptdate < date '1996-01-01' + interval '1' year` were logically simplified to `SEARCH($21(l_receiptdate), Sarg[[1996-01-01..1997-01-01)])`. This transformation reduces redundancy and complexity by consolidating the two separate date conditions into a single, more efficient search condition.

Secondly, Case 3 simplifies the date conditions into a single search condition, potentially enabling more efficient index-based retrieval. Thirdly, according to Rule 2, performing a `GROUP BY` operation earlier through a subquery can reduce intermediate dataset sizes, enhancing performance. Lastly, Rule 3 highlights the use of `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY`, which can optimize sorting by allowing the database engine to stop once the required number of rows is reached. Ensuring `l_shipmode` is indexed can further enhance performance by reducing sorting and filtering costs. These strategies collectively aim to streamline query execution and improve performance by minimizing data processing and leveraging indexing."""\n\nQuery Rewrite Rules:\n### Rule FILTER_INTO_JOIN:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: This SQL query rewrite rule applies when a filter condition is placed on the result set of an INNER JOIN operation. The filter\'s expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there\'s a matching row in the non-preserving side\'s table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned."""\n\n### Rule FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains conditions that can be statically determined as always true (e.g., constant expressions like `1=1` or tautologies based on the column data types and constraints), then these conditions don\'t affect the result set.\n**Transformations**: Remove such conditions from the WHERE clause. If this results in an empty WHERE clause, remove the WHERE clause entirely.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause simplifies to conditions that are always false or involve comparisons with NULL in a way that the outcome is always false or NULL (e.g., `column != column` or `1=0`), indicating no rows can satisfy the filter.\n**Transformations**: Replace the query with one that selects no rows. This could be represented in different ways based on the SQL dialect. One universal method might be selecting from a dual table with a false condition.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains complex conditions that can be simplified based on known constraints, constants, or through logical simplification (e.g., `column IS NOT NULL AND column IS NOT NULL` simplifies to `column IS NOT NULL`).\n**Transformations**: Simplify the conditions according to logical rules and known constraints.

The suggestions and rules indicate that we should focus on filtering conditions, simplifying expressions, and optimizing joins.\n\n### Reasoning:\n\n1. **FILTER_INTO_JOIN**: This rule is crucial because it allows us to push filter conditions into the join operation, reducing the dataset size before the join. This is particularly effective when the conditions only involve columns from one side of the join, as is the case with the `lineitem` table in the given query. By applying this rule first, we can significantly reduce the amount of data processed in subsequent operations.\n\n2. **FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS**: After applying the `FILTER_INTO_JOIN` rule, we should simplify any remaining filter expressions. This rule helps in removing redundant conditions and simplifying complex expressions, which can further optimize the query execution.\n\nThe provided rule subset sequences suggest that `FILTER_INTO_JOIN` should be applied before `FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS`. Additionally, `FILTER_INTO_JOIN` appears in both sequences, indicating its importance and priority in the optimization process.\n\nBased on these considerations, the overall sequence for applying the rules is:\n\n1. **FILTER_INTO_JOIN**: Apply this rule first to push applicable filter conditions into the join operation.\n2. **FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS**: Apply this rule next to simplify and reduce any remaining filter expressions.\n\nThus, the arranged order of the rules is as follows:\n\n```python\n["FILTER_INTO_JOIN", "FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS"]\n```', 'time': 3.1599245071411133}

Firstly, by applying Case 1, conditions involving only the `lineitem` table are moved to filter this table before joining with `orders`, reducing the dataset size and improving efficiency. Secondly, Case 3 simplifies the date conditions into a single search condition, potentially enabling more efficient index-based retrieval. Thirdly, according to Rule 2, performing a `GROUP BY` operation earlier through a subquery can reduce intermediate dataset sizes, enhancing performance. Lastly, Rule 3 highlights the use of `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY`, which can optimize sorting by allowing the database engine to stop once the required number of rows is reached. Ensuring `l_shipmode` is indexed can further enhance performance by reducing sorting and filtering costs. These strategies collectively aim to streamline query execution and improve performance by minimizing data processing and leveraging indexing."""\n\nQuery Rewrite Rules:\n### Rule FILTER_INTO_JOIN:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: This SQL query rewrite rule applies when a filter condition is placed on the result set of an INNER JOIN operation. The filter\'s expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there\'s a matching row in the non-preserving side\'s table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned."""\n\n### Rule FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains conditions that can be statically determined as always true (e.g., constant expressions like `1=1` or tautologies based on the column data types and constraints), then these conditions don\'t affect the result set.\n**Transformations**: Remove such conditions from the WHERE clause.
