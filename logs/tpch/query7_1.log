Transform `(x AND y) OR z` into `(x OR z) AND (y OR z)`.\n2. Transform `(x OR y) AND z` into `(x AND z) OR (y AND z)`.\n"""\nRule 2:\n"""\n**Conditions**: The SQL query utilizes traditional filtering mechanisms such as NOT EXISTS, NOT IN, EXISTS, IN, OR within JOINs and WHERE clauses.\n**Transformations**: - Replace IN with INTERSECT for querying intersecting datasets to potentially improve index usage and query speed.\n- Rewrite conditions using the OR operator into a series of UNION ALL operations to enhance code maintainability and performance.\n- Use EXCEPT instead of NOT IN or anti-joins to minimize duplicate row processing and optimize resource use, effectively reducing execution time.\n"""\nRule 3:\n"""\n**Conditions**: The SQL query optimization rules apply under the following conditions:\n1. When the `LIMIT` clause is used to fetch a specified number of rows.\n2. When `ORDER BY` is used in conjunction with `LIMIT` to sort and limit the number of rows retrieved, particularly when sorting can leverage an index.\n3. When `DISTINCT` is used along with `LIMIT` to quickly identify and return unique rows without scanning the full dataset.\n4. During the use of `GROUP BY`, where optimization might involve sorting or traversing indexes in order to efficiently compute group values without processing the entire dataset.\n5. When sorting a specific number of rows from a single table based on non-indexed columns, utilizing in-memory sorting (`filesort`) techniques.\n**Transformations**: The specific SQL transformations that emerge from applying these optimization rules are:\n1. Combining `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY` encourages the database engine to stop the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained, avoiding full table sorts.\n2. Using `LIMIT` with `DISTINCT` leads to an early termination of the search for unique rows as soon as the needed amount is gathered, reducing time and resources spent on scanning the entire dataset.\n3. In the context of `GROUP BY`, optimizations may include indexing strategies or modifications to the way sorting is handled, such as employing `filesort` mechanisms that do not require temporary tables, ensuring that the database engine processes only the necessary data for group computations.\n4. Efficiencies are gained by encouraging the use of indexed columns with `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT`, making queries more efficient by reducing the cost associated with sorting and filtering operations.\n"""\nRule 4:\n"""\n**Conditions**: The SQL query rewrite rule applies when there are:\n- Functions or operations (especially deterministic ones) within the SELECT, WHERE, JOIN conditions, or any part of the query that is executed multiple times for the same row.\n- The presence of potentially computationally expensive operations or function calls that are not dependent on the data of the specific row and thus can be optimized.\n**Transformations**: 1. Move repeated function calls or operations outside of loops, if applicable. For example, if a function that generates a calculated value based on constants or parameters (not row-specific data) is being called in a loop, calculate the value once before the loop and store the result for reuse.\n   \n2. Replace inline functions in the SELECT or WHERE clause with a pre-calculated column if the function is deterministic and the input data does not change frequently. This might involve:\n   - Creating a temporary table that includes the results of the expensive function calls.\n   - Using a subquery or a Common Table Expression (CTE) that calculates the value once and then joins it with the main query.\n   \n3. When using aggregate functions that are called multiple times with the same parameters, consider storing the result in a variable or a temporary table, especially if the data set is large.\n\n4. Avoid using functions on indexed columns in the WHERE clause. This prevents the database from using the index efficiently. If a function must be used, consider creating a computed column that pre-calculates the function\'s result and index that column instead.\n\n5. If possible, simplify expressions and calculations to reduce their complexity and execution time. This might involve algebraic simplification or breaking down complex calculations into simpler parts that can be calculated separately and then combined.\n\nExample:\nOriginal Query:\n```sql\nSELECT id, name, expensive_function(column) as expensive_result\nFROM table\nWHERE expensive_function(column) > 100;\n```\n\nTransformed Query using a CTE:\n```sql\nWITH PreCalculated AS (\n  SELECT id, name, column, expensive_function(column) as expensive_result\n  FROM table\n)\nSELECT id, name, expensive_sel as expensive_result\nFROM PreCalculated\nWHERE expensive_result > 100;\n```\n"""\nRule 5:\n"""\n**Conditions**: The rule applies when the original SQL query performs multiple scans or joins on the same table to retrieve different attributes for certain conditions, or when the query structure results in redundant data processing and complexity that could be reduced.\n**Transformations**: - Combine multiple joins into a single join operation by using `CASE` statements to conditionally select different attributes from the table in one pass. \n- Use the `COALESCE` function in conjunction with `CASE` statements to efficiently merge conditional attributes into distinct columns based on specific criteria without the need for additional joins.\n- Optimize the selection of conditional attributes by integrating `GROUP BY` with aggregate functions like `MAX` within `CASE` statements, thus condensing the result set to only the necessary data and avoiding needless retrieval and processing steps.\n- The overall transformation leads to a single, more efficient query that accomplishes the tasks of multiple, less efficient operations, improving performance, and simplifying the query for better readability and maintenance.\n"""'}], 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'stream': False, 'temperature': 0.1}}

The filter's expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there's a matching row in the non-preserving side's table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned.\n```\n\nLogical Plan Changes After Rewrite: ```\n  LogicalSort(sort0=[$0(n_name)], sort1=[$1(n_name)], sort2=[$2(l_shipdate)], dir0=[ASC], dir1=[ASC], dir2=[ASC], fetch=[1])\r\n    LogicalAggregate(group=[{0, 1, 2}], revenue=[SUM($3)])\r\n      LogicalProject(supp_nation=[$41(n_name)], cust_nation=[$45(n_name)], l_year=[EXTRACT(FLAG(YEAR), $17(l_shipdate))], volume=[*($12(l_extendedprice), -(1, $13(l_discount)))])\r\n-       LogicalFilter(condition=[AND(=($0(s_suppkey), $9(l_suppkey)), =($23(o_orderkey), $7(l_orderkey)), =($32(c_custkey), $24(o_custkey)), =($3(s_nationkey), $40(n_nationkey)), =($35(c_nationkey), $44(n_nationkey)), OR(AND(=(CAST($41(n_name)):CHAR(6) NOT NULL, 'FRANCE'), =(CAST($45(n_name)):CHAR(12) NOT NULL, 'SAUDI ARABIA')), AND(=(CAST($41(n_name)):CHAR(12) NOT NULL, 'SAUDI ARABIA'), =(CAST($45(n_name)):CHAR(6) NOT NULL, 'FRANCE'))), >=($17(l_shipdate), 1995-01-01), <=($17(l_shipdate), 1996-12-31))])\r\n+       LogicalJoin(condition=[AND(=($35(c_nationkey), $44(n_nationkey)), OR(AND(=(CAST($41(n_name)):CHAR(6) NOT NULL, 'FRANCE'), =(CAST($45(n_name)):CHAR(12) NOT NULL, 'SAUDI ARABIA')), AND(=(CAST($41(n_name)):CHAR(12) NOT NULL, 'SAUDI ARABIA'), =(CAST($45(n_name)):CHAR(6) NOT NULL, 'FRANCE'))))], joinType=[inner])\r\n-         LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n?                                 ^^\n\n+         LogicalJoin(condition=[=($3(s_nationkey), $40(n_nationkey))], joinType=[inner])\r\n?                                +++++++++ ^^^^ +++++++++++++++++++++\n\n-           LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n?                                   ^\n\n+           LogicalJoin(condition=[=($32(c_custkey), $24(o_custkey))], joinType=[inner])\r\n?                                  +++++++++++ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ +++ +++\n\n-             LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n?                                    ^ ^\n\n+             LogicalJoin(condition=[=($23(o_orderkey), $7(l_orderkey))], joinType=[inner])\r\n?                                    ^^^^^^^^^ ^ ++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n-               LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n?                                      ^^\n\n+               LogicalJoin(condition=[=($0(s_suppkey), $9(l_suppkey))], joinType=[inner])\r\n?                                      ^^^^^^^^ +++ ++++++++++++++++++\n\n-                 LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n-                   LogicalTableScan(table=[[supplier]])\r\n? --\n\n+                 LogicalTableScan(table=[[supplier]])\r\n+                 LogicalFilter(condition=[SEARCH($10(l_shipdate), Sarg[[1995-01-01..1996-12-31]])])\r\n                    LogicalTableScan(table=[[lineitem]])\r\n-                 LogicalTableScan(table=[[orders]])\r\n? --\n\n+               LogicalTableScan(table=[[orders]])\r\n-               LogicalTableScan(table=[[customer]])\r\n? --\n\n+             LogicalTableScan(table=[[customer]])\r\n-             LogicalTableScan(table=[[nation]])\r\n            LogicalTableScan(table=[[nation]])\r\n+         LogicalTableScan(table=[[nation]])\r\n  \n```"}], 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'stream': False, 'temperature': 0.1}}

The original filter condition included a range condition on `l_shipdate` using `>=` and `<=` operators. After the rewrite, this condition has been replaced with a `SEARCH` function that specifies a range `[1995-01-01..1996-12-31]`. This suggests a simplification or optimization of the range condition.\n\nStep 2: Parsing the logical plan changes, we see that the SQL query's `WHERE` clause originally contained the condition `l_shipdate between date '1995-01-01' and date '1996-12-31'`. This condition has been transformed into a `SEARCH` function with a range, which is a more efficient way to express the same condition. The rest of the `WHERE` clause remains unchanged, indicating that no other simplifications or removals were applied.\n\nStep 3: The query rewrite rule contains multiple cases. Based on the parsed SQL query changes, the transformation applied corresponds to Case 3. This case involves simplifying complex conditions based on known constraints or logical simplifications. The transformation of the `l_shipdate` condition into a `SEARCH` function fits this description, as it simplifies the range condition into a more efficient form.\n\nStep 4: In this query rewrite process, the `WHERE` clause's condition `l_shipdate between date '1995-01-01' and date '1996-12-31'` was identified as a candidate for simplification. The rewrite rule applied Case 3, which simplifies conditions using logical rules.

The filter's expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there's a matching row in the non-preserving side's table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned.\n```\n\nLogical Plan Changes After Rewrite: ```\n  LogicalSort(sort0=[$0(n_name)], sort1=[$1(n_name)], sort2=[$2(l_shipdate)], dir0=[ASC], dir1=[ASC], dir2=[ASC], fetch=[1])\r\n    LogicalAggregate(group=[{0, 1, 2}], revenue=[SUM($3)])\r\n      LogicalProject(supp_nation=[$41(n_name)], cust_nation=[$45(n_name)], l_year=[EXTRACT(FLAG(YEAR), $17(l_shipdate))], volume=[*($12(l_extendedprice), -(1, $13(l_discount)))])\r\n-       LogicalFilter(condition=[AND(=($0(s_suppkey), $9(l_suppkey)), =($23(o_orderkey), $7(l_orderkey)), =($32(c_custkey), $24(o_custkey)), =($3(s_nationkey), $40(n_nationkey)), =($35(c_nationkey), $44(n_nationkey)), OR(AND(=(CAST($41(n_name)):CHAR(6) NOT NULL, 'FRANCE'), =(CAST($45(n_name)):CHAR(12) NOT NULL, 'SAUDI ARABIA')), AND(=(CAST($41(n_name)):CHAR(12) NOT NULL, 'SAUDI ARABIA'), =(CAST($45(n_name)):CHAR(6) NOT NULL, 'FRANCE'))), >=($17(l_shipdate), 1995-01-01), <=($17(l_shipdate), 1996-12-31))])\r\n+       LogicalJoin(condition=[AND(=($35(c_nationkey), $44(n_nationkey)), OR(AND(=(CAST($41(n_name)):CHAR(6) NOT NULL, 'FRANCE'), =(CAST($45(n_name)):CHAR(12) NOT NULL, 'SAUDI ARABIA')), AND(=(CAST($41(n_name)):CHAR(12) NOT NULL, 'SAUDI ARABIA'), =(CAST($45(n_name)):CHAR(6) NOT NULL, 'FRANCE'))))], joinType=[inner])\r\n-         LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n?                                 ^^\n\n+         LogicalJoin(condition=[=($3(s_nationkey), $40(n_nationkey))], joinType=[inner])\r\n?                                +++++++++ ^^^^ +++++++++++++++++++++\n\n-           LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n?                                   ^\n\n+           LogicalJoin(condition=[=($32(c_custkey), $24(o_custkey))], joinType=[inner])\r\n?                                  +++++++++++ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ +++ +++\n\n-             LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n?                                    ^ ^\n\n+             LogicalJoin(condition=[=($23(o_orderkey), $7(l_orderkey))], joinType=[inner])\r\n?                                    ^^^^^^^^^ ^ ++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n-               LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n?                                      ^^\n\n+               LogicalJoin(condition=[=($0(s_suppkey), $9(l_suppkey))], joinType=[inner])\r\n?                                      ^^^^^^^^ +++ ++++++++++++++++++\n\n-                 LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n-                   LogicalTableScan(table=[[supplier]])\r\n? --\n\n+                 LogicalTableScan(table=[[supplier]])\r\n+                 LogicalFilter(condition=[SEARCH($10(l_shipdate), Sarg[[1995-01-01..1996-12-31]])])\r\n                    LogicalTableScan(table=[[lineitem]])\r\n-                 LogicalTableScan(table=[[orders]])\r\n? --\n\n+               LogicalTableScan(table=[[orders]])\r\n-               LogicalTableScan(table=[[customer]])\r\n? --\n\n+             LogicalTableScan(table=[[customer]])\r\n-             LogicalTableScan(table=[[nation]])\r\n            LogicalTableScan(table=[[nation]])\r\n+         LogicalTableScan(table=[[nation]])\r\n  \n```"}], 'response': "Step 1: The logical plan changes indicate that several filter conditions initially applied in a `LogicalFilter` node have been moved into `LogicalJoin` conditions. Specifically, the conditions involving equality checks between keys of different tables have been moved into the `LogicalJoin` nodes. Additionally, the date range filter on `l_shipdate` has been moved to a `LogicalFilter` directly on the `lineitem` table.\n\nStep 2: Parsing the logical plan changes, we see the following transformations:\n- The condition `s_suppkey = l_suppkey` is moved from the `WHERE` clause to the `ON` clause of the join between `supplier` and `lineitem`.\n- The condition `o_orderkey = l_orderkey` is moved from the `WHERE` clause to the `ON` clause of the join between `orders` and `lineitem`.\n- The condition `c_custkey = o_custkey` is moved from the `WHERE` clause to the `ON` clause of the join between `customer` and `orders`.\n- The condition `s_nationkey = n1.n_nationkey` is moved from the `WHERE` clause to the `ON` clause of the join between `supplier` and `nation n1`.\n- The condition `c_nationkey = n2.n_nationkey` is moved from the `WHERE` clause to the `ON` clause of the join between `customer` and `nation n2`.\n- The condition `(n1.n_name = 'FRANCE' and n2.n_name = 'SAUDI ARABIA') or (n1.n_name = 'SAUDI ARABIA' and n2.n_name = 'FRANCE')` is moved from the `WHERE` clause to the `ON` clause of the join between `nation n1` and `nation n2`.\n- The condition `l_shipdate between date '1995-01-01' and date '1996-12-31'` is moved from the `WHERE` clause to a `LogicalFilter` directly on the `lineitem` table.\n\nStep 3: The SQL query rewrite rule contains multiple cases. The changes observed in the logical plan match Case 1 of the query rewrite rule. This case applies when filter conditions in a `WHERE` clause can be logically associated with only one side of an `INNER JOIN` and can be moved into the `ON` clause of the join. In this query, all the conditions moved involve columns from only one side of their respective joins.\n\nStep 4: The SQL query changes can be explained as follows:\n- The conditions `s_suppkey = l_suppkey`, `o_orderkey = l_orderkey`, `c_custkey = o_custkey`, `s_nationkey = n1.n_nationkey`, and `c_nationkey = n2.n_nationkey` were originally in the `WHERE` clause but only involved columns from the tables being joined. According to Case 1 of the rewrite rule, these conditions were moved to the `ON` clause of their respective `INNER JOIN` operations to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n- The condition `(n1.n_name = 'FRANCE' and n2.n_name = 'SAUDI ARABIA') or (n1.n_name = 'SAUDI ARABIA' and n2.n_name = 'FRANCE')` was also moved to the `ON` clause of the join between `nation n1` and `nation n2` because it only involves columns from these tables.\n- The date range filter `l_shipdate between date '1995-01-01' and date '1996-12-31'` was moved to a `LogicalFilter` directly on the `lineitem` table, which is an optimization to filter rows earlier in the query execution process. This aligns with the principle of pushing filters down to reduce the size of intermediate results.", 'time': 6.902982711791992}

Move repeated function calls or operations outside of loops, if applicable. For example, if a function that generates a calculated value based on constants or parameters (not row-specific data) is being called in a loop, calculate the value once before the loop and store the result for reuse.\n   \n2. Replace inline functions in the SELECT or WHERE clause with a pre-calculated column if the function is deterministic and the input data does not change frequently. This might involve:\n   - Creating a temporary table that includes the results of the expensive function calls.\n   - Using a subquery or a Common Table Expression (CTE) that calculates the value once and then joins it with the main query.\n   \n3. When using aggregate functions that are called multiple times with the same parameters, consider storing the result in a variable or a temporary table, especially if the data set is large.\n\n4.

03:17:38,899 root WARNING Failed to synthesize rewrites from NL rewrite rules: Step 1: Analyze the given SQL query against each rewrite rule's conditions.

- **Rule 1**: The SQL query contains a complex `WHERE` clause with nested `AND`/`OR` conditions: `(n1.n_name = 'FRANCE' and n2.n_name = 'SAUDI ARABIA') or (n1.n_name = 'SAUDI ARABIA' and n2.n_name = 'FRANCE')`. This matches the conditions for Rule 1, which deals with optimizing such nested conditions.

- **Rule 2**: The SQL query uses `OR` within the `WHERE` clause, which matches the conditions for Rule 2. However, the transformations suggested (using `INTERSECT`, `UNION ALL`, `EXCEPT`) are not directly applicable to the current structure of the query, as it does not involve `IN`, `EXISTS`, or `NOT IN`.

- **Rule 3**: The SQL query uses `LIMIT` in conjunction with `ORDER BY`, which matches the conditions for Rule 3. The query also involves `GROUP BY`, which is another condition for Rule 3.

- **Rule 4**: The query uses the `extract(year from l_shipdate)` function, which is a deterministic operation within the `SELECT` clause. This matches the conditions for Rule 4, which deals with optimizing repeated or computationally expensive operations.

- **Rule 5**: The query does not perform multiple scans or joins on the same table for different attributes, nor does it have redundant data processing that could be reduced by combining joins or using `CASE` statements. Therefore, Rule 5 does not match the query.

Step 2: Apply the transformations for the matched rules.

Query Rewrite 1:
```plaintext
The SQL query contains a complex `WHERE` clause with nested `AND`/`OR` conditions: `(n1.n_name = 'FRANCE' and n2.n_name = 'SAUDI ARABIA') or (n1.n_name = 'SAUDI ARABIA' and n2.n_name = 'FRANCE')`. According to Rule 1, we can transform this using the transformation `(x AND y) OR z` into `(x OR z) AND (y OR z)`. However, in this specific case, the transformation does not simplify the query further because the conditions are already in a minimal form for the given logic. Therefore, no transformation is applied here.
```

Query Rewrite 3:
```plaintext
The SQL query uses `LIMIT` in conjunction with `ORDER BY`, which matches the conditions for Rule 3. The transformation suggests that combining `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY` encourages the database engine to stop the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained, avoiding full table sorts. This is already being utilized in the query, so no further transformation is needed. Additionally, the use of `GROUP BY` is optimized by the database engine to efficiently compute group values without processing the entire dataset, which is already being leveraged in the query.
```

Query Rewrite 4:
```plaintext
The query uses the `extract(year from l_shipdate)` function, which is a deterministic operation within the `SELECT` clause. According to Rule 4, we can optimize this by pre-calculating the year extraction outside of the main query if it is used multiple times. However, since it is only used once in the subquery, no transformation is necessary. If it were used multiple times, we could consider using a CTE or a temporary table to store the pre-calculated year values.
```

In summary, while the SQL query matches several conditions for optimization, the transformations either do not apply or are already being utilized effectively in the query. Therefore, no significant changes are made to the query structure.
03:17:38,899 root INFO Generated queries:
Query 1: In this query rewrite process, the `WHERE` clause's condition `l_shipdate between date '1995-01-01' and date '1996-12-31'` was identified as a candidate for simplification. The rewrite rule applied Case 3, which simplifies conditions using logical rules. The transformation replaced the explicit range condition with a `SEARCH` function, which is likely optimized for performance. This change does not alter the logical outcome of the query but potentially improves execution efficiency by using a more direct representation of the range condition.
Query 2: The SQL query changes can be explained as follows:
- The conditions `s_suppkey = l_suppkey`, `o_orderkey = l_orderkey`, `c_custkey = o_custkey`, `s_nationkey = n1.n_nationkey`, and `c_nationkey = n2.n_nationkey` were originally in the `WHERE` clause but only involved columns from the tables being joined. According to Case 1 of the rewrite rule, these conditions were moved to the `ON` clause of their respective `INNER JOIN` operations to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.
- The condition `(n1.n_name = 'FRANCE' and n2.n_name = 'SAUDI ARABIA') or (n1.n_name = 'SAUDI ARABIA' and n2.n_name = 'FRANCE')` was also moved to the `ON` clause of the join between `nation n1` and `nation n2` because it only involves columns from these tables.
- The date range filter `l_shipdate between date '1995-01-01' and date '1996-12-31'` was moved to a `LogicalFilter` directly on the `lineitem` table, which is an optimization to filter rows earlier in the query execution process. This aligns with the principle of pushing filters down to reduce the size of intermediate results.

"""In this query rewrite process, the `WHERE` clause's condition `l_shipdate between date '1995-01-01' and date '1996-12-31'` was identified as a candidate for simplification. The rewrite rule applied Case 3, which simplifies conditions using logical rules. The transformation replaced the explicit range condition with a `SEARCH` function, which is likely optimized for performance. This change does not alter the logical outcome of the query but potentially improves execution efficiency by using a more direct representation of the range condition."""

Query Rewrite 2:
"""The SQL query changes can be explained as follows:
- The conditions `s_suppkey = l_suppkey`, `o_orderkey = l_orderkey`, `c_custkey = o_custkey`, `s_nationkey = n1.n_nationkey`, and `c_nationkey = n2.n_nationkey` were originally in the `WHERE` clause but only involved columns from the tables being joined. According to Case 1 of the rewrite rule, these conditions were moved to the `ON` clause of their respective `INNER JOIN` operations to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.
- The condition `(n1.n_name = 'FRANCE' and n2.n_name = 'SAUDI ARABIA') or (n1.n_name = 'SAUDI ARABIA' and n2.n_name = 'FRANCE')` was also moved to the `ON` clause of the join between `nation n1` and `nation n2` because it only involves columns from these tables.
- The date range filter `l_shipdate between date '1995-01-01' and date '1996-12-31'` was moved to a `LogicalFilter` directly on the `lineitem` table, which is an optimization to filter rows earlier in the query execution process. This aligns with the principle of pushing filters down to reduce the size of intermediate results."""

The filter's expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there's a matching row in the non-preserving side's table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned."}], [], [{'name': 'JOIN_TO_CORRELATE', 'rewrite': "**Conditions**: The join type is either INNER JOIN or LEFT JOIN.

The second rewrite involves moving join conditions from the `WHERE` clause to the `ON` clause of their respective `INNER JOIN` operations, as per Case 1 of the rewrite rule, to reduce dataset sizes before joining. Additionally, the condition involving nation names was relocated to the `ON` clause of the join between `nation n1` and `nation n2`, as it pertains only to these tables. Furthermore, the date range filter was pushed down to a `LogicalFilter` on the `lineitem` table, optimizing the query by filtering rows earlier in the execution process, thus reducing the size of intermediate results. These strategies collectively aim to streamline the query execution and improve efficiency."""\n\nQuery Rewrite Rules:\n### Rule FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains conditions that can be statically determined as always true (e.g., constant expressions like `1=1` or tautologies based on the column data types and constraints), then these conditions don\'t affect the result set.\n**Transformations**: Remove such conditions from the WHERE clause. If this results in an empty WHERE clause, remove the WHERE clause entirely.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause simplifies to conditions that are always false or involve comparisons with NULL in a way that the outcome is always false or NULL (e.g., `column != column` or `1=0`), indicating no rows can satisfy the filter.\n**Transformations**: Replace the query with one that selects no rows. This could be represented in different ways based on the SQL dialect. One universal method might be selecting from a dual table with a false condition.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains complex conditions that can be simplified based on known constraints, constants, or through logical simplification (e.g., `column IS NOT NULL AND column IS NOT NULL` simplifies to `column IS NOT NULL`).\n**Transformations**: Simplify the conditions according to logical rules and known constraints. Remove redundancy and unnecessary complexity."""\n\n### Rule FILTER_INTO_JOIN:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: This SQL query rewrite rule applies when a filter condition is placed on the result set of an INNER JOIN operation. The filter\'s expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there\'s a matching row in the non-preserving side\'s table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned."""\n\n### Rule JOIN_TO_CORRELATE:\n"""**Conditions**: The join type is either INNER JOIN or LEFT JOIN. There are no requirements in the query that would inherently create NULL values on the left side when there are no matching rows on the right side (for INNER JOIN, this condition is naturally met; for LEFT JOIN, it is met if every row on the left side has at least one corresponding row on the right side according to the join condition).\n**Transformations**: 1. Identify the INNER JOIN or LEFT JOIN condition in the SQL query. 2. Extract the ON clause representing the join condition. 3.

In the first rewrite, the condition `l_shipdate between date \'1995-01-01\' and date \'1996-12-31\'` was simplified using a `SEARCH` function, which is optimized for performance, without altering the query\'s logical outcome. The second rewrite involves moving join conditions from the `WHERE` clause to the `ON` clause of their respective `INNER JOIN` operations, as per Case 1 of the rewrite rule, to reduce dataset sizes before joining. Additionally, the condition involving nation names was relocated to the `ON` clause of the join between `nation n1` and `nation n2`, as it pertains only to these tables. Furthermore, the date range filter was pushed down to a `LogicalFilter` on the `lineitem` table, optimizing the query by filtering rows earlier in the execution process, thus reducing the size of intermediate results. These strategies collectively aim to streamline the query execution and improve efficiency."""\n\nQuery Rewrite Rule Sets:\n### FILTER Operator Rules: ["FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS", "FILTER_INTO_JOIN"]\n\n### JOIN Operator Rules: ["FILTER_INTO_JOIN"]\n\nQuery Rewrite Rule Explanations:\n### Rule FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains conditions that can be statically determined as always true (e.g., constant expressions like `1=1` or tautologies based on the column data types and constraints), then these conditions don\'t affect the result set.\n**Transformations**: Remove such conditions from the WHERE clause. If this results in an empty WHERE clause, remove the WHERE clause entirely.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause simplifies to conditions that are always false or involve comparisons with NULL in a way that the outcome is always false or NULL (e.g., `column != column` or `1=0`), indicating no rows can satisfy the filter.\n**Transformations**: Replace the query with one that selects no rows. This could be represented in different ways based on the SQL dialect. One universal method might be selecting from a dual table with a false condition.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains complex conditions that can be simplified based on known constraints, constants, or through logical simplification (e.g., `column IS NOT NULL AND column IS NOT NULL` simplifies to `column IS NOT NULL`).\n**Transformations**: Simplify the conditions according to logical rules and known constraints. Remove redundancy and unnecessary complexity."""\n\n### Rule FILTER_INTO_JOIN:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: This SQL query rewrite rule applies when a filter condition is placed on the result set of an INNER JOIN operation. The filter\'s expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there\'s a matching row in the non-preserving side\'s table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned."""'}], 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'stream': False, 'temperature': 0.1}}

In the first rewrite, the condition `l_shipdate between date \'1995-01-01\' and date \'1996-12-31\'` was simplified using a `SEARCH` function, which is optimized for performance, without altering the query\'s logical outcome. The second rewrite involves moving join conditions from the `WHERE` clause to the `ON` clause of their respective `INNER JOIN` operations, as per Case 1 of the rewrite rule, to reduce dataset sizes before joining. Additionally, the condition involving nation names was relocated to the `ON` clause of the join between `nation n1` and `nation n2`, as it pertains only to these tables. Furthermore, the date range filter was pushed down to a `LogicalFilter` on the `lineitem` table, optimizing the query by filtering rows earlier in the execution process, thus reducing the size of intermediate results. These strategies collectively aim to streamline the query execution and improve efficiency."""\n\nQuery Rewrite Rules:\n### Rule FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains conditions that can be statically determined as always true (e.g., constant expressions like `1=1` or tautologies based on the column data types and constraints), then these conditions don\'t affect the result set.\n**Transformations**: Remove such conditions from the WHERE clause. If this results in an empty WHERE clause, remove the WHERE clause entirely.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause simplifies to conditions that are always false or involve comparisons with NULL in a way that the outcome is always false or NULL (e.g., `column != column` or `1=0`), indicating no rows can satisfy the filter.\n**Transformations**: Replace the query with one that selects no rows. This could be represented in different ways based on the SQL dialect. One universal method might be selecting from a dual table with a false condition.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains complex conditions that can be simplified based on known constraints, constants, or through logical simplification (e.g., `column IS NOT NULL AND column IS NOT NULL` simplifies to `column IS NOT NULL`).\n**Transformations**: Simplify the conditions according to logical rules and known constraints. Remove redundancy and unnecessary complexity."""\n\n### Rule FILTER_INTO_JOIN:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: This SQL query rewrite rule applies when a filter condition is placed on the result set of an INNER JOIN operation. The filter\'s expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there\'s a matching row in the non-preserving side\'s table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned."""\n\nRule Subset Sequences:\n### Rule Sequence 1: ["FILTER_INTO_JOIN", "FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS"]\n\n### Rule Sequence 2: ["FILTER_INTO_JOIN"]'}], 'response': 'To optimize the given SQL query, we need to apply the provided query rewrite rules in an effective sequence.

In the first rewrite, the condition `l_shipdate between date \'1995-01-01\' and date \'1996-12-31\'` was simplified using a `SEARCH` function, which is optimized for performance, without altering the query\'s logical outcome. The second rewrite involves moving join conditions from the `WHERE` clause to the `ON` clause of their respective `INNER JOIN` operations, as per Case 1 of the rewrite rule, to reduce dataset sizes before joining. Additionally, the condition involving nation names was relocated to the `ON` clause of the join between `nation n1` and `nation n2`, as it pertains only to these tables. Furthermore, the date range filter was pushed down to a `LogicalFilter` on the `lineitem` table, optimizing the query by filtering rows earlier in the execution process, thus reducing the size of intermediate results. These strategies collectively aim to streamline the query execution and improve efficiency."""\n\nQuery Rewrite Rules:\n### Rule FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains conditions that can be statically determined as always true (e.g., constant expressions like `1=1` or tautologies based on the column data types and constraints), then these conditions don\'t affect the result set.\n**Transformations**: Remove such conditions from the WHERE clause. If this results in an empty WHERE clause, remove the WHERE clause entirely.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause simplifies to conditions that are always false or involve comparisons with NULL in a way that the outcome is always false or NULL (e.g., `column != column` or `1=0`), indicating no rows can satisfy the filter.\n**Transformations**: Replace the query with one that selects no rows. This could be represented in different ways based on the SQL dialect. One universal method might be selecting from a dual table with a false condition.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains complex conditions that can be simplified based on known constraints, constants, or through logical simplification (e.g., `column IS NOT NULL AND column IS NOT NULL` simplifies to `column IS NOT NULL`).\n**Transformations**: Simplify the conditions according to logical rules and known constraints. Remove redundancy and unnecessary complexity."""\n\n### Rule FILTER_INTO_JOIN:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: This SQL query rewrite rule applies when a filter condition is placed on the result set of an INNER JOIN operation. The filter\'s expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there\'s a matching row in the non-preserving side\'s table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned."""\n\nArranged Rule Sequence: ["FILTER_INTO_JOIN", "FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS"]\n\nUtilized Rules: ["FILTER_INTO_JOIN"]\n\nUnutilized Rules: ["FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS"]'}], 'response': 'Step 1: The unutilized rule "FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS" should be examined to see if it matches the provided query rewrite suggestions. The suggestions mention simplifying conditions and removing unnecessary complexity, which aligns with the purpose of "FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS". Therefore, this rule should be prioritized as it could potentially optimize the query by simplifying the WHERE clause conditions.\n\nStep 2: To better match the provided query rewrite suggestions, the rule "FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS" should be placed before "FILTER_INTO_JOIN". This is because simplifying expressions and reducing complexity can lead to a more efficient application of join conditions, as it reduces the dataset size before the join operation. Thus, the new arrangement should start with "FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS" followed by "FILTER_INTO_JOIN".\n\n```python\n["FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS", "FILTER_INTO_JOIN"]\n```', 'time': 2.3417999744415283}
