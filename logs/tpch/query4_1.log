When the `LIMIT` clause is used to fetch a specified number of rows.\n2. When `ORDER BY` is used in conjunction with `LIMIT` to sort and limit the number of rows retrieved, particularly when sorting can leverage an index.\n3. When `DISTINCT` is used along with `LIMIT` to quickly identify and return unique rows without scanning the full dataset.\n4. During the use of `GROUP BY`, where optimization might involve sorting or traversing indexes in order to efficiently compute group values without processing the entire dataset.\n5. When sorting a specific number of rows from a single table based on non-indexed columns, utilizing in-memory sorting (`filesort`) techniques.\n**Transformations**: The specific SQL transformations that emerge from applying these optimization rules are:\n1. Combining `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY` encourages the database engine to stop the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained, avoiding full table sorts.\n2. Using `LIMIT` with `DISTINCT` leads to an early termination of the search for unique rows as soon as the needed amount is gathered, reducing time and resources spent on scanning the entire dataset.\n3. In the context of `GROUP BY`, optimizations may include indexing strategies or modifications to the way sorting is handled, such as employing `filesort` mechanisms that do not require temporary tables, ensuring that the database engine processes only the necessary data for group computations.\n4. Efficiencies are gained by encouraging the use of indexed columns with `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT`, making queries more efficient by reducing the cost associated with sorting and filtering operations.\n"""\nRule 3:\n"""\n**Conditions**: The SQL query rewrite rule applies when there are:\n- Functions or operations (especially deterministic ones) within the SELECT, WHERE, JOIN conditions, or any part of the query that is executed multiple times for the same row.\n- The presence of potentially computationally expensive operations or function calls that are not dependent on the data of the specific row and thus can be optimized.\n**Transformations**: 1. Move repeated function calls or operations outside of loops, if applicable. For example, if a function that generates a calculated value based on constants or parameters (not row-specific data) is being called in a loop, calculate the value once before the loop and store the result for reuse.\n   \n2. Replace inline functions in the SELECT or WHERE clause with a pre-calculated column if the function is deterministic and the input data does not change frequently. This might involve:\n   - Creating a temporary table that includes the results of the expensive function calls.\n   - Using a subquery or a Common Table Expression (CTE) that calculates the value once and then joins it with the main query.\n   \n3. When using aggregate functions that are called multiple times with the same parameters, consider storing the result in a variable or a temporary table, especially if the data set is large.\n\n4. Avoid using functions on indexed columns in the WHERE clause. This prevents the database from using the index efficiently. If a function must be used, consider creating a computed column that pre-calculates the function\'s result and index that column instead.\n\n5. If possible, simplify expressions and calculations to reduce their complexity and execution time. This might involve algebraic simplification or breaking down complex calculations into simpler parts that can be calculated separately and then combined.\n\nExample:\nOriginal Query:\n```sql\nSELECT id, name, expensive_function(column) as expensive_result\nFROM table\nWHERE expensive_function(column) > 100;\n```\n\nTransformed Query using a CTE:\n```sql\nWITH PreCalculated AS (\n  SELECT id, name, column, expensive_function(column) as expensive_result\n  FROM table\n)\nSELECT id, name, expensive_sel as expensive_result\nFROM PreCalculated\nWHERE expensive_result > 100;\n```\n"""'}], 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'stream': False, 'temperature': 0.1}}

Specifically, the `LogicalAggregate` operation has been adjusted to directly apply to the data source, and the `LogicalProject` layer has been removed. This suggests that the rewrite rule has optimized the query by eliminating unnecessary projection layers and directly applying aggregation to the data source.\n\nStep 2: Parsing the logical plan changes, we observe the following detailed changes:\n- The `LogicalAggregate` operation initially grouped by `o_orderpriority` and counted the number of orders. This operation has been shifted to directly apply to the data source, as indicated by the change in the group index from `{0}` to `{5}`.\n- The `LogicalProject` layer, which was projecting `o_orderpriority`, has been removed. This indicates that the projection was deemed unnecessary for the final output.\n- The `LogicalFilter` and `LogicalTableScan` operations remain unchanged, indicating that the filtering conditions and table scans are still necessary for the query execution.\n\nStep 3: The query rewrite rule contains two cases. Based on the parsed SQL query changes:\n- Case 1 is matched because the `GROUP BY` clause groups by a simple column (`o_orderpriority`), and the aggregate function (`COUNT(*)`) operates directly on columns without expressions. The `SELECT` clause contains only the columns used in the `GROUP BY` clause and the aggregate function without transformations.\n- Case 2 is not applicable because there is no inner query that serves as a passthrough for the columns used in the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions.\n\nStep 4: The SQL query changes can be explained by Case 1 of the query rewrite rule. The rule identifies that the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions can be directly applied to the data source (`orders` table) without the need for an intermediate projection layer. This is evident from the removal of the `LogicalProject` layer and the adjustment of the `LogicalAggregate` operation to directly use the data source. The rewrite optimizes the query by eliminating unnecessary operations, thus streamlining the execution plan.', 'time': 4.937075614929199}

When the `LIMIT` clause is used to fetch a specified number of rows.\n2. When `ORDER BY` is used in conjunction with `LIMIT` to sort and limit the number of rows retrieved, particularly when sorting can leverage an index.\n3. When `DISTINCT` is used along with `LIMIT` to quickly identify and return unique rows without scanning the full dataset.\n4. During the use of `GROUP BY`, where optimization might involve sorting or traversing indexes in order to efficiently compute group values without processing the entire dataset.\n5. When sorting a specific number of rows from a single table based on non-indexed columns, utilizing in-memory sorting (`filesort`) techniques.\n**Transformations**: The specific SQL transformations that emerge from applying these optimization rules are:\n1. Combining `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY` encourages the database engine to stop the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained, avoiding full table sorts.\n2. Using `LIMIT` with `DISTINCT` leads to an early termination of the search for unique rows as soon as the needed amount is gathered, reducing time and resources spent on scanning the entire dataset.\n3. In the context of `GROUP BY`, optimizations may include indexing strategies or modifications to the way sorting is handled, such as employing `filesort` mechanisms that do not require temporary tables, ensuring that the database engine processes only the necessary data for group computations.\n4. Efficiencies are gained by encouraging the use of indexed columns with `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT`, making queries more efficient by reducing the cost associated with sorting and filtering operations.\n"""\nRule 3:\n"""\n**Conditions**: The SQL query rewrite rule applies when there are:\n- Functions or operations (especially deterministic ones) within the SELECT, WHERE, JOIN conditions, or any part of the query that is executed multiple times for the same row.\n- The presence of potentially computationally expensive operations or function calls that are not dependent on the data of the specific row and thus can be optimized.\n**Transformations**: 1. Move repeated function calls or operations outside of loops, if applicable. For example, if a function that generates a calculated value based on constants or parameters (not row-specific data) is being called in a loop, calculate the value once before the loop and store the result for reuse.\n   \n2. Replace inline functions in the SELECT or WHERE clause with a pre-calculated column if the function is deterministic and the input data does not change frequently. This might involve:\n   - Creating a temporary table that includes the results of the expensive function calls.\n   - Using a subquery or a Common Table Expression (CTE) that calculates the value once and then joins it with the main query.\n   \n3. When using aggregate functions that are called multiple times with the same parameters, consider storing the result in a variable or a temporary table, especially if the data set is large.\n\n4. Avoid using functions on indexed columns in the WHERE clause. This prevents the database from using the index efficiently. If a function must be used, consider creating a computed column that pre-calculates the function\'s result and index that column instead.\n\n5. If possible, simplify expressions and calculations to reduce their complexity and execution time. This might involve algebraic simplification or breaking down complex calculations into simpler parts that can be calculated separately and then combined.\n\nExample:\nOriginal Query:\n```sql\nSELECT id, name, expensive_function(column) as expensive_result\nFROM table\nWHERE expensive_function(column) > 100;\n```\n\nTransformed Query using a CTE:\n```sql\nWITH PreCalculated AS (\n  SELECT id, name, column, expensive_function(column) as expensive_result\n  FROM table\n)\nSELECT id, name, expensive_sel as expensive_result\nFROM PreCalculated\nWHERE expensive_result > 100;\n```\n"""'}], 'response': 'Step 1: Analyze the given SQL query against each rewrite rule\'s conditions to determine applicability.\n\n- **Rule 1 Conditions**: The query uses `EXISTS` in the `WHERE` clause, which matches the condition of utilizing traditional filtering mechanisms. However, the transformations suggested by Rule 1 (replacing `IN` with `INTERSECT`, rewriting `OR` with `UNION ALL`, and using `EXCEPT` instead of `NOT IN`) do not directly apply to the current query structure, as it does not contain `IN`, `OR`, or `NOT IN` clauses.\n\n- **Rule 2 Conditions**: The query uses `LIMIT` in conjunction with `ORDER BY`, which matches condition 1 of Rule 2. Additionally, the query uses `GROUP BY`, which matches condition 4. Therefore, Rule 2 is applicable.\n\n- **Rule 3 Conditions**: The query contains operations involving date arithmetic (`o_orderdate < date \'1995-01-01\' + interval \'3\' month`), which are deterministic and could potentially be optimized.

Additionally, the use of `GROUP BY` can be optimized by leveraging indexing strategies or efficient sorting mechanisms, as suggested by Rule 2\'s transformation 3. However, since the query already uses `ORDER BY o_orderpriority` and `LIMIT 1`, the primary optimization is ensuring that the database engine efficiently handles the sorting and limiting process, potentially using an index on `o_orderpriority` if available. No explicit SQL transformation is needed, as the query structure already aligns with the optimization strategies described in Rule 2.\n"""\n\nIn summary, Rule 2 applies to the SQL query, optimizing the use of `LIMIT` and `ORDER BY` to enhance performance by minimizing unnecessary sorting operations.

Initially, the `LogicalFilter` contained an `EXISTS` condition, which has been replaced by a `LogicalCorrelate` with an `inner` join type. This suggests that the `EXISTS` sub-query was rewritten into a join operation, consistent with the transformations described in Case 2 of the query rewrite rule.\n\nStep 2: Parsing the logical plan changes, we observe the following detailed changes:\n- The `EXISTS` sub-query in the `LogicalFilter` was removed and replaced by a `LogicalCorrelate` with an `inner` join type.\n- The `LogicalCorrelate` uses a correlation variable `$cor0` to join the `orders` table with the `lineitem` table on the condition `l_orderkey = o_orderkey`.\n- The `LogicalAggregate` and `LogicalProject` operations were added to handle the aggregation and projection of the necessary columns after the join.\n\nStep 3: The parsed SQL query changes match Case 2 of the query rewrite rule, specifically the transformation for `EXISTS` sub-queries. The original `EXISTS` condition was converted into a join operation, which is a key transformation described in Case 2.\n\nStep 4: The SQL query changes can be explained as follows:\n- The original query contained an `EXISTS` sub-query within the `WHERE` clause, checking for the existence of rows in the `lineitem` table where `l_orderkey = o_orderkey` and `l_commitdate < l_receiptdate`.\n- According to Case 2 of the query rewrite rule, this `EXISTS` condition was transformed into a join operation. The `LogicalCorrelate` with an `inner` join type was introduced to join the `orders` table with the `lineitem` table on the condition `l_orderkey = o_orderkey`.\n- The join operation ensures that only rows from the `orders` table that have matching rows in the `lineitem` table (satisfying the original `EXISTS` condition) are included in the result.\n- The `LogicalAggregate` and `LogicalProject` operations were added to handle the aggregation of the `order_count` and the projection of the `o_orderpriority` column, maintaining the original query's intent to group by `o_orderpriority` and count the orders.", 'time': 6.841795444488525}
03:14:02,159 root INFO Generated queries:
Query 1: The SQL query changes can be explained by Case 1 of the query rewrite rule. The rule identifies that the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions can be directly applied to the data source (`orders` table) without the need for an intermediate projection layer. This is evident from the removal of the `LogicalProject` layer and the adjustment of the `LogicalAggregate` operation to directly use the data source. The rewrite optimizes the query by eliminating unnecessary operations, thus streamlining the execution plan.
Query 2: The SQL query changes can be explained as follows:
- The original query contained an `EXISTS` sub-query within the `WHERE` clause, checking for the existence of rows in the `lineitem` table where `l_orderkey = o_orderkey` and `l_commitdate < l_receiptdate`.
- According to Case 2 of the query rewrite rule, this `EXISTS` condition was transformed into a join operation. The `LogicalCorrelate` with an `inner` join type was introduced to join the `orders` table with the `lineitem` table on the condition `l_orderkey = o_orderkey`.
- The join operation ensures that only rows from the `orders` table that have matching rows in the `lineitem` table (satisfying the original `EXISTS` condition) are included in the result.
- The `LogicalAggregate` and `LogicalProject` operations were added to handle the aggregation of the `order_count` and the projection of the `o_orderpriority` column, maintaining the original query's intent to group by `o_orderpriority` and count the orders.
Query 3: The SQL query uses `LIMIT` in conjunction with `ORDER BY`, which allows the database engine to optimize the sorting process by stopping as soon as the required number of rows is obtained. This avoids a full table sort, which is a direct application of Rule 2's transformation 1. Additionally, the use of `GROUP BY` can be optimized by leveraging indexing strategies or efficient sorting mechanisms, as suggested by Rule 2's transformation 3. However, since the query already uses `ORDER BY o_orderpriority` and `LIMIT 1`, the primary optimization is ensuring that the database engine efficiently handles the sorting and limiting process, potentially using an index on `o_orderpriority` if available. No explicit SQL transformation is needed, as the query structure already aligns with the optimization strategies described in Rule 2.

Query Rewrite 1:
"""The SQL query changes can be explained by Case 1 of the query rewrite rule. The rule identifies that the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions can be directly applied to the data source (`orders` table) without the need for an intermediate projection layer. This is evident from the removal of the `LogicalProject` layer and the adjustment of the `LogicalAggregate` operation to directly use the data source. The rewrite optimizes the query by eliminating unnecessary operations, thus streamlining the execution plan."""

Query Rewrite 2:
"""The SQL query changes can be explained as follows:
- The original query contained an `EXISTS` sub-query within the `WHERE` clause, checking for the existence of rows in the `lineitem` table where `l_orderkey = o_orderkey` and `l_commitdate < l_receiptdate`.
- According to Case 2 of the query rewrite rule, this `EXISTS` condition was transformed into a join operation. The `LogicalCorrelate` with an `inner` join type was introduced to join the `orders` table with the `lineitem` table on the condition `l_orderkey = o_orderkey`.
- The join operation ensures that only rows from the `orders` table that have matching rows in the `lineitem` table (satisfying the original `EXISTS` condition) are included in the result.
- The `LogicalAggregate` and `LogicalProject` operations were added to handle the aggregation of the `order_count` and the projection of the `o_orderpriority` column, maintaining the original query's intent to group by `o_orderpriority` and count the orders."""

Query Rewrite 3:
"""The SQL query uses `LIMIT` in conjunction with `ORDER BY`, which allows the database engine to optimize the sorting process by stopping as soon as the required number of rows is obtained. This avoids a full table sort, which is a direct application of Rule 2's transformation 1. Additionally, the use of `GROUP BY` can be optimized by leveraging indexing strategies or efficient sorting mechanisms, as suggested by Rule 2's transformation 3. However, since the query already uses `ORDER BY o_orderpriority` and `LIMIT 1`, the primary optimization is ensuring that the database engine efficiently handles the sorting and limiting process, potentially using an index on `o_orderpriority` if available. No explicit SQL transformation is needed, as the query structure already aligns with the optimization strategies described in Rule 2."""

Firstly, the query can be streamlined by applying the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions directly to the `orders` table, eliminating unnecessary intermediate operations, as described in Query Rewrite 1. This involves removing the `LogicalProject` layer and adjusting the `LogicalAggregate` operation to directly utilize the data source, thereby simplifying the execution plan. Secondly, the `EXISTS` sub-query in the `WHERE` clause can be transformed into a join operation, as outlined in Query Rewrite 2. This involves introducing a `LogicalCorrelate` with an `inner` join type to connect the `orders` and `lineitem` tables, ensuring that only relevant rows are included in the result. This transformation maintains the original query\'s intent by using `LogicalAggregate` and `LogicalProject` operations for aggregation and projection. Lastly, as per Query Rewrite 3, the use of `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY` allows the database engine to optimize the sorting process by stopping once the required number of rows is obtained, avoiding a full table sort.

The suggestions emphasize three main transformations: merging the `AGGREGATE` and `PROJECT` operations, transforming the `EXISTS` sub-query into a `JOIN`, and optimizing the `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY`. \n\n1. **AGGREGATE Operator Rules**: The suggestion to streamline the query by applying `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions directly to the `orders` table aligns with the `AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE` rule. This rule should be prioritized to eliminate unnecessary intermediate operations and simplify the execution plan.\n\n2. **CORRELATE and FILTER Operator Rules**: The suggestion to transform the `EXISTS` sub-query into a join operation aligns with the `FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE` rule. This transformation is crucial for optimizing the query by ensuring that only relevant rows are included in the result. Since both `CORRELATE` and `FILTER` operator rules contain the same rule, they should be aligned with this suggestion.\n\n3. **PROJECT Operator Rules**: The `AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE` rule is also relevant here, as it involves removing the `LogicalProject` layer when it only renames columns without transformations. This aligns with the suggestion to streamline the query by merging operations.\n\nBased on these observations, the rules should be arranged as follows:\n\nAGGREGATE Operator Rules: ```python\n[\n    "AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE"\n]\n```\n\nCORRELATE Operator Rules: ```python\n[\n    "FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE"\n]\n```\n\nFILTER Operator Rules: ```python\n[\n    "FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE"\n]\n```\n\nPROJECT Operator Rules: ```python\n[\n    "AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE"\n]\n```', 'time': 3.783442497253418}

Firstly, the query can be streamlined by applying the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions directly to the `orders` table, eliminating unnecessary intermediate operations, as described in Query Rewrite 1. This involves removing the `LogicalProject` layer and adjusting the `LogicalAggregate` operation to directly utilize the data source, thereby simplifying the execution plan. Secondly, the `EXISTS` sub-query in the `WHERE` clause can be transformed into a join operation, as outlined in Query Rewrite 2. This involves introducing a `LogicalCorrelate` with an `inner` join type to connect the `orders` and `lineitem` tables, ensuring that only relevant rows are included in the result. This transformation maintains the original query\'s intent by using `LogicalAggregate` and `LogicalProject` operations for aggregation and projection. Lastly, as per Query Rewrite 3, the use of `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY` allows the database engine to optimize the sorting process by stopping once the required number of rows is obtained, avoiding a full table sort. This optimization can be further enhanced by leveraging indexing strategies or efficient sorting mechanisms, particularly on the `o_orderpriority` column, to ensure efficient handling of the sorting and limiting process."""\n\nQuery Rewrite Rules:\n### Rule AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: - The SQL query contains a `GROUP BY` clause that groups by simple columns (no expressions in the `GROUP BY` list).\n- The aggregate functions in the `SELECT` clause operate directly on columns (no expressions inside the aggregate functions).\n- The `SELECT` clause only contains the columns used in the `GROUP BY` clause and the aggregates without any transformations or additional expressions.\n**Transformations**: - Directly apply the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions to the data source referred to in the `FROM` clause of the inner query before the projection.\n- Eliminate the outer projection layer if it only renames the columns without transforming them.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: - The `SELECT` clause of an outer query precisely matches the columns used in the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions of an inner query, without any column transformations or renamings.\n- The inner `SELECT` only serves as a passthrough for these columns.\n**Transformations**: - Remove the inner `SELECT` layer, directly applying the aggregate functions and `GROUP BY` to the original data source."""\n\n### Rule FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: The query contains a scalar sub-query within the WHERE clause.\n**Transformations**: The scalar sub-query should be transformed into a LEFT JOIN operation with an aggregate function on the column(s) being selected in the sub-query.
