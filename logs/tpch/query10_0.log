When the `LIMIT` clause is used to fetch a specified number of rows.\n2. When `ORDER BY` is used in conjunction with `LIMIT` to sort and limit the number of rows retrieved, particularly when sorting can leverage an index.\n3. When `DISTINCT` is used along with `LIMIT` to quickly identify and return unique rows without scanning the full dataset.\n4. During the use of `GROUP BY`, where optimization might involve sorting or traversing indexes in order to efficiently compute group values without processing the entire dataset.\n5. When sorting a specific number of rows from a single table based on non-indexed columns, utilizing in-memory sorting (`filesort`) techniques.\n**Transformations**: The specific SQL transformations that emerge from applying these optimization rules are:\n1. Combining `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY` encourages the database engine to stop the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained, avoiding full table sorts.\n2. Using `LIMIT` with `DISTINCT` leads to an early termination of the search for unique rows as soon as the needed amount is gathered, reducing time and resources spent on scanning the entire dataset.\n3. In the context of `GROUP BY`, optimizations may include indexing strategies or modifications to the way sorting is handled, such as employing `filesort` mechanisms that do not require temporary tables, ensuring that the database engine processes only the necessary data for group computations.\n4. Efficiencies are gained by encouraging the use of indexed columns with `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT`, making queries more efficient by reducing the cost associated with sorting and filtering operations.\n"""\nRule 3:\n"""\n**Conditions**: The SQL query rewrite rule applies when there are:\n- Functions or operations (especially deterministic ones) within the SELECT, WHERE, JOIN conditions, or any part of the query that is executed multiple times for the same row.\n- The presence of potentially computationally expensive operations or function calls that are not dependent on the data of the specific row and thus can be optimized.\n**Transformations**: 1. Move repeated function calls or operations outside of loops, if applicable. For example, if a function that generates a calculated value based on constants or parameters (not row-specific data) is being called in a loop, calculate the value once before the loop and store the result for reuse.\n   \n2. Replace inline functions in the SELECT or WHERE clause with a pre-calculated column if the function is deterministic and the input data does not change frequently. This might involve:\n   - Creating a temporary table that includes the results of the expensive function calls.\n   - Using a subquery or a Common Table Expression (CTE) that calculates the value once and then joins it with the main query.\n   \n3. When using aggregate functions that are called multiple times with the same parameters, consider storing the result in a variable or a temporary table, especially if the data set is large.\n\n4. Avoid using functions on indexed columns in the WHERE clause. This prevents the database from using the index efficiently. If a function must be used, consider creating a computed column that pre-calculates the function\'s result and index that column instead.\n\n5. If possible, simplify expressions and calculations to reduce their complexity and execution time. This might involve algebraic simplification or breaking down complex calculations into simpler parts that can be calculated separately and then combined.\n\nExample:\nOriginal Query:\n```sql\nSELECT id, name, expensive_function(column) as expensive_result\nFROM table\nWHERE expensive_function(column) > 100;\n```\n\nTransformed Query using a CTE:\n```sql\nWITH PreCalculated AS (\n  SELECT id, name, column, expensive_function(column) as expensive_result\n  FROM table\n)\nSELECT id, name, expensive_sel as expensive_result\nFROM PreCalculated\nWHERE expensive_result > 100;\n```\n"""'}], 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'stream': False, 'temperature': 0.1}}

The filter's expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there's a matching row in the non-preserving side's table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned.\n```\n\nLogical Plan Changes After Rewrite: ```\n  LogicalSort(sort0=[$2], dir0=[DESC], fetch=[20])\r\n    LogicalProject(c_custkey=[$0(c_custkey)], c_name=[$1(c_name)], revenue=[$7], c_acctbal=[$2(c_acctbal)], n_name=[$4(n_name)], c_address=[$5(c_address)], c_phone=[$3(c_phone)], c_comment=[$6(c_comment)])\r\n      LogicalAggregate(group=[{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}], revenue=[SUM($7)])\r\n        LogicalProject(c_custkey=[$0(c_custkey)], c_name=[$1(c_name)], c_acctbal=[$5(c_acctbal)], c_phone=[$4(c_phone)], n_name=[$34(n_name)], c_address=[$2(c_address)], c_comment=[$7(c_comment)], $f7=[*($22(l_extendedprice), -(1, $23(l_discount)))])\r\n-         LogicalFilter(condition=[AND(=($0(c_custkey), $9(o_custkey)), =($17(l_orderkey), $8(o_orderkey)), >=($12(o_orderdate), 1993-11-01), <($12(o_orderdate), +(1993-11-01, 3:INTERVAL MONTH)), =(CAST($25(l_returnflag)):CHAR(1) NOT NULL, 'R'), =($3(c_nationkey), $33(n_nationkey)))])\r\n+         LogicalJoin(condition=[=($3(c_nationkey), $33(n_nationkey))], joinType=[inner])\r\n-           LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n?                                  ^ ^\n\n+           LogicalJoin(condition=[=($17(l_orderkey), $8(o_orderkey))], joinType=[inner])\r\n?                                  ^^^^^^^^^ ^ ++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n-             LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n?                                     ^\n\n+             LogicalJoin(condition=[=($0(c_custkey), $9(o_custkey))], joinType=[inner])\r\n?                                    ++++++++++ ^^^^^^^^^^^^ +++ +++\n\n-               LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n-                 LogicalTableScan(table=[[customer]])\r\n? --\n\n+               LogicalTableScan(table=[[customer]])\r\n+               LogicalFilter(condition=[AND(>=($4(o_orderdate), 1993-11-01), <($4(o_orderdate), +(1993-11-01, 3:INTERVAL MONTH)))])\r\n                  LogicalTableScan(table=[[orders]])\r\n+             LogicalFilter(condition=[=(CAST($8(l_returnflag)):CHAR(1) NOT NULL, 'R')])\r\n                LogicalTableScan(table=[[lineitem]])\r\n-             LogicalTableScan(table=[[nation]])\r\n? --\n\n+           LogicalTableScan(table=[[nation]])\r\n  \n```"}], 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'stream': False, 'temperature': 0.1}}

Specifically, the original condition `AND(=($0(c_custkey), $9(o_custkey)), =($17(l_orderkey), $8(o_orderkey)), >=($12(o_orderdate), 1993-11-01), <($12(o_orderdate), +(1993-11-01, 3:INTERVAL MONTH)), =(CAST($25(l_returnflag)):CHAR(1) NOT NULL, 'R'), =($3(c_nationkey), $33(n_nationkey)))` was transformed to `AND(=($0(c_custkey), $9(o_custkey)), =($17(l_orderkey), $8(o_orderkey)), SEARCH($12(o_orderdate), Sarg[[1993-11-01..1994-02-01)]), =(CAST($25(l_returnflag)):CHAR(1) NOT NULL, 'R'), =($3(c_nationkey), $33(n_nationkey)))`. The key change is the replacement of the range condition on `o_orderdate` with a `SEARCH` function that simplifies the date range condition.\n\nStep 2: Parsing the logical plan changes, the SQL query's WHERE clause originally contained the condition `o_orderdate >= date '1993-11-01' and o_orderdate < date '1993-11-01' + interval '3' month`. This was transformed into `SEARCH($12(o_orderdate), Sarg[[1993-11-01..1994-02-01)])`, which is a more efficient representation of the date range condition. The `SEARCH` function is used to represent a sargable (search argument) condition that can be more efficiently processed by the query optimizer.\n\nStep 3: The query rewrite rule contains multiple cases. The changes in the SQL query match Case 3 of the query rewrite rule. Case 3 involves simplifying complex conditions based on known constraints or logical simplification. The transformation of the date range condition into a `SEARCH` function is a simplification that aligns with this case.\n\nStep 4: In this query rewrite process, the WHERE clause's date range condition `o_orderdate >= date '1993-11-01' and o_orderdate < date '1993-11-01' + interval '3' month` was simplified to `SEARCH($12(o_orderdate), Sarg[[1993-11-01..1994-02-01)])`. This transformation is a logical simplification that makes the condition more efficient for the query optimizer to process. By using the `SEARCH` function, the query can potentially leverage index-based optimizations, improving performance. This simplification falls under Case 3 of the query rewrite rule, which focuses on removing redundancy and unnecessary complexity in conditions.", 'time': 5.342434644699097}

The filter's expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there's a matching row in the non-preserving side's table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned.\n```\n\nLogical Plan Changes After Rewrite: ```\n  LogicalSort(sort0=[$2], dir0=[DESC], fetch=[20])\r\n    LogicalProject(c_custkey=[$0(c_custkey)], c_name=[$1(c_name)], revenue=[$7], c_acctbal=[$2(c_acctbal)], n_name=[$4(n_name)], c_address=[$5(c_address)], c_phone=[$3(c_phone)], c_comment=[$6(c_comment)])\r\n      LogicalAggregate(group=[{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}], revenue=[SUM($7)])\r\n        LogicalProject(c_custkey=[$0(c_custkey)], c_name=[$1(c_name)], c_acctbal=[$5(c_acctbal)], c_phone=[$4(c_phone)], n_name=[$34(n_name)], c_address=[$2(c_address)], c_comment=[$7(c_comment)], $f7=[*($22(l_extendedprice), -(1, $23(l_discount)))])\r\n-         LogicalFilter(condition=[AND(=($0(c_custkey), $9(o_custkey)), =($17(l_orderkey), $8(o_orderkey)), >=($12(o_orderdate), 1993-11-01), <($12(o_orderdate), +(1993-11-01, 3:INTERVAL MONTH)), =(CAST($25(l_returnflag)):CHAR(1) NOT NULL, 'R'), =($3(c_nationkey), $33(n_nationkey)))])\r\n+         LogicalJoin(condition=[=($3(c_nationkey), $33(n_nationkey))], joinType=[inner])\r\n-           LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n?                                  ^ ^\n\n+           LogicalJoin(condition=[=($17(l_orderkey), $8(o_orderkey))], joinType=[inner])\r\n?                                  ^^^^^^^^^ ^ ++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n-             LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n?                                     ^\n\n+             LogicalJoin(condition=[=($0(c_custkey), $9(o_custkey))], joinType=[inner])\r\n?                                    ++++++++++ ^^^^^^^^^^^^ +++ +++\n\n-               LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n-                 LogicalTableScan(table=[[customer]])\r\n? --\n\n+               LogicalTableScan(table=[[customer]])\r\n+               LogicalFilter(condition=[AND(>=($4(o_orderdate), 1993-11-01), <($4(o_orderdate), +(1993-11-01, 3:INTERVAL MONTH)))])\r\n                  LogicalTableScan(table=[[orders]])\r\n+             LogicalFilter(condition=[=(CAST($8(l_returnflag)):CHAR(1) NOT NULL, 'R')])\r\n                LogicalTableScan(table=[[lineitem]])\r\n-             LogicalTableScan(table=[[nation]])\r\n? --\n\n+           LogicalTableScan(table=[[nation]])\r\n  \n```"}], 'response': "Step 1: The logical plan changes indicate that the query rewrite rule has transformed the original SQL query by altering the join conditions and moving certain filter conditions closer to the relevant tables. Specifically, the original query had a series of joins with a `LogicalFilter` applied after the joins. The rewrite has pushed filter conditions into the join conditions and directly onto the tables involved in the joins.\n\nStep 2: Parsing the logical plan changes, we observe the following detailed changes:\n- The `LogicalFilter` that applied conditions such as `c_custkey = o_custkey`, `l_orderkey = o_orderkey`, `o_orderdate >= date '1993-11-01'`, `o_orderdate < date '1993-11-01' + interval '3' month`, `l_returnflag = 'R'`, and `c_nationkey = n_nationkey` has been removed.\n- These conditions have been distributed as follows:\n  - The condition `c_custkey = o_custkey` is now part of the `LogicalJoin` condition between `customer` and `orders`.\n  - The condition `l_orderkey = o_orderkey` is now part of the `LogicalJoin` condition between `orders` and `lineitem`.\n  - The conditions `o_orderdate >= date '1993-11-01'` and `o_orderdate < date '1993-11-01' + interval '3' month` have been applied as a `LogicalFilter` directly on the `orders` table.\n  - The condition `l_returnflag = 'R'` has been applied as a `LogicalFilter` directly on the `lineitem` table.\n  - The condition `c_nationkey = n_nationkey` is now part of the `LogicalJoin` condition between `customer` and `nation`.\n\nStep 3: The query rewrite rule contains multiple cases. The parsed SQL query changes match Case 1 of the rewrite rule. This case applies when a filter condition is placed on the result set of an INNER JOIN operation, and the filter's expressions can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs. The conditions `o_orderdate >= date '1993-11-01'`, `o_orderdate < date '1993-11-01' + interval '3' month`, and `l_returnflag = 'R'` are applied directly to the `orders` and `lineitem` tables, respectively, before the joins, which aligns with the transformations described in Case 1.\n\nStep 4: The SQL query changes can be explained as follows: The original query had a `WHERE` clause that applied several filter conditions after performing a series of joins. The rewrite rule identified that some of these conditions could be applied earlier in the query execution process to reduce the size of intermediate datasets. Specifically, the conditions related to `orders` and `lineitem` tables were moved to be applied directly on these tables before the joins. This transformation optimizes the query by reducing the number of rows involved in the joins, thus improving performance. The conditions that were moved into the join conditions ensure that only relevant rows are joined, maintaining the query's correctness while enhancing efficiency.", 'time': 6.040475130081177}

When the `LIMIT` clause is used to fetch a specified number of rows.\n2. When `ORDER BY` is used in conjunction with `LIMIT` to sort and limit the number of rows retrieved, particularly when sorting can leverage an index.\n3. When `DISTINCT` is used along with `LIMIT` to quickly identify and return unique rows without scanning the full dataset.\n4. During the use of `GROUP BY`, where optimization might involve sorting or traversing indexes in order to efficiently compute group values without processing the entire dataset.\n5. When sorting a specific number of rows from a single table based on non-indexed columns, utilizing in-memory sorting (`filesort`) techniques.\n**Transformations**: The specific SQL transformations that emerge from applying these optimization rules are:\n1. Combining `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY` encourages the database engine to stop the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained, avoiding full table sorts.\n2. Using `LIMIT` with `DISTINCT` leads to an early termination of the search for unique rows as soon as the needed amount is gathered, reducing time and resources spent on scanning the entire dataset.\n3. In the context of `GROUP BY`, optimizations may include indexing strategies or modifications to the way sorting is handled, such as employing `filesort` mechanisms that do not require temporary tables, ensuring that the database engine processes only the necessary data for group computations.\n4. Efficiencies are gained by encouraging the use of indexed columns with `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT`, making queries more efficient by reducing the cost associated with sorting and filtering operations.\n"""\nRule 3:\n"""\n**Conditions**: The SQL query rewrite rule applies when there are:\n- Functions or operations (especially deterministic ones) within the SELECT, WHERE, JOIN conditions, or any part of the query that is executed multiple times for the same row.\n- The presence of potentially computationally expensive operations or function calls that are not dependent on the data of the specific row and thus can be optimized.\n**Transformations**: 1. Move repeated function calls or operations outside of loops, if applicable. For example, if a function that generates a calculated value based on constants or parameters (not row-specific data) is being called in a loop, calculate the value once before the loop and store the result for reuse.\n   \n2. Replace inline functions in the SELECT or WHERE clause with a pre-calculated column if the function is deterministic and the input data does not change frequently. This might involve:\n   - Creating a temporary table that includes the results of the expensive function calls.\n   - Using a subquery or a Common Table Expression (CTE) that calculates the value once and then joins it with the main query.\n   \n3. When using aggregate functions that are called multiple times with the same parameters, consider storing the result in a variable or a temporary table, especially if the data set is large.\n\n4. Avoid using functions on indexed columns in the WHERE clause. This prevents the database from using the index efficiently. If a function must be used, consider creating a computed column that pre-calculates the function\'s result and index that column instead.\n\n5.

- **Rule 1 Conditions**: 
  - The query performs a `GROUP BY` operation along with `JOIN` operations.
  - The query could benefit from reducing the size of intermediate datasets.
  - The query involves large datasets, as indicated by the use of `GROUP BY` and `JOIN`.
  - Reordering operations could potentially improve performance.
  
  The query matches Rule 1 conditions because it involves `GROUP BY` and `JOIN` operations, and reordering these operations could enhance performance.

- **Rule 2 Conditions**:
  - The query uses `LIMIT` in conjunction with `ORDER BY`.
  - The query involves `GROUP BY`, which might benefit from sorting optimizations.
  
  The query matches Rule 2 conditions because it uses `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY` and involves `GROUP BY`.

- **Rule 3 Conditions**:
  - The query does not have repeated function calls or operations that are executed multiple times for the same row.
  - There are no computationally expensive operations or function calls that are not dependent on the data of the specific row.
  
  The query does not match Rule 3 conditions as there are no repeated or computationally expensive operations that can be optimized.

```
Explanation: The query is restructured to perform the `GROUP BY` operation on the `lineitem` table before joining with other tables. This reduces the size of the intermediate dataset, potentially improving performance.

Query Rewrite 2:
```sql
-- Apply Rule 2: Ensure efficient use of `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY`.

-- The transformation for Rule 2 is already inherently applied in the original query.
-- The `LIMIT` clause is used with `ORDER BY revenue DESC`, which encourages the database engine to stop sorting once the top 20 rows are identified.

-- No additional transformation is needed as the query already aligns with Rule 2's optimization strategy.
```
Explanation: The original query already uses `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY`, which aligns with Rule 2's optimization strategy. No further transformation is necessary.
02:37:50,89 root INFO Generated queries:
Query 1: The SQL query changes can be explained as follows: The original query had a `WHERE` clause that applied several filter conditions after performing a series of joins. The rewrite rule identified that some of these conditions could be applied earlier in the query execution process to reduce the size of intermediate datasets. Specifically, the conditions related to `orders` and `lineitem` tables were moved to be applied directly on these tables before the joins. This transformation optimizes the query by reducing the number of rows involved in the joins, thus improving performance. The conditions that were moved into the join conditions ensure that only relevant rows are joined, maintaining the query's correctness while enhancing efficiency.
Query 2: In this query rewrite process, the WHERE clause's date range condition `o_orderdate >= date '1993-11-01' and o_orderdate < date '1993-11-01' + interval '3' month` was simplified to `SEARCH($12(o_orderdate), Sarg[[1993-11-01..1994-02-01)])`. This transformation is a logical simplification that makes the condition more efficient for the query optimizer to process. By using the `SEARCH` function, the query can potentially leverage index-based optimizations, improving performance. This simplification falls under Case 3 of the query rewrite rule, which focuses on removing redundancy and unnecessary complexity in conditions.

By moving conditions related to the `orders` and `lineitem` tables to be applied directly on these tables before the joins, the query reduces the number of rows involved in the joins, thus optimizing performance. This ensures that only relevant rows are joined, maintaining the query\'s correctness while enhancing efficiency. The second strategy simplifies the date range condition in the `WHERE` clause. Originally expressed as `o_orderdate >= date \'1993-11-01\' and o_orderdate < date \'1993-11-01\' + interval \'3\' month`, it is transformed into a more efficient form using the `SEARCH` function: `SEARCH($12(o_orderdate), Sarg[[1993-11-01..1994-02-01)])`.

Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there\'s a matching row in the non-preserving side\'s table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned."""\n\n### Rule FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains conditions that can be statically determined as always true (e.g., constant expressions like `1=1` or tautologies based on the column data types and constraints), then these conditions don\'t affect the result set.\n**Transformations**: Remove such conditions from the WHERE clause. If this results in an empty WHERE clause, remove the WHERE clause entirely.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause simplifies to conditions that are always false or involve comparisons with NULL in a way that the outcome is always false or NULL (e.g., `column != column` or `1=0`), indicating no rows can satisfy the filter.\n**Transformations**: Replace the query with one that selects no rows. This could be represented in different ways based on the SQL dialect. One universal method might be selecting from a dual table with a false condition.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains complex conditions that can be simplified based on known constraints, constants, or through logical simplification (e.g., `column IS NOT NULL AND column IS NOT NULL` simplifies to `column IS NOT NULL`).\n**Transformations**: Simplify the conditions according to logical rules and known constraints.

This may involve moving computations or column transformations from the SELECT clause to a sub-query that the WHERE clause is applied on, ensuring the final SELECT clause on the outermost query matches the original query\'s expected outcome. - Before: SELECT col1, transformation_function(col2) FROM table WHERE condition; - After: SELECT col1, transformation_function(col2) FROM (SELECT col1, col2 FROM table WHERE condition) AS subquery;"""\n\n### Rule AGGREGATE_REDUCE_FUNCTIONS:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: any SELECT statement or subquery using the AVG aggregate function\n**Transformations**: AVG(x) as SUM(x) / COUNT(x)\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: computing the population standard deviation\n**Transformations**: STDDEV_POP(x) as the square root of (`SUM(x^2) - SUM(x)^2 / COUNT(x)`) / COUNT(x)\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: for the sample standard deviation computation\n**Transformations**: STDDEV_SAMP(x) as the square root of (`SUM(x^2) - SUM(x)^2 / COUNT(x)`) / (COUNT(x) - 1)\nCase 4:\n**Conditions**: for the population variance computation\n**Transformations**: VAR_POP(x) as (`SUM(x^2) - SUM(x)^2 / COUNT(x)`) / COUNT(x)\nCase 5:\n**Conditions**: for the sample variance computation\n**Transformations**: VAR_SAMP(x) as (`SUM(x^2) - SUM(x)^2 / COUNT(x)`) / (COUNT(x) - 1)\nCase 6:\n**Conditions**: to compute population covariance\n**Transformations**: COVAR_POP(x, y) by applying a formula involving SUM and COUNT\nCase 7:\n**Conditions**: using a formula for sample covariance\n**Transformations**: COVAR_SAMP(x, y) using a formula involving SUM, COUNT, and an adjustment for sample calculations\nCase 8:\n**Conditions**: for transforming REGR_SXX(x, y) and REGR_SYY(x, y)\n**Transformations**: into expressions involving the computation of VAR_POP(x) or VAR_POP(y) respectively, multiplied by REGR_COUNT(x, y)"""\n\n### Rule JOIN_TO_CORRELATE:\n"""**Conditions**: The join type is either INNER JOIN or LEFT JOIN. There are no requirements in the query that would inherently create NULL values on the left side when there are no matching rows on the right side (for INNER JOIN, this condition is naturally met; for LEFT JOIN, it is met if every row on the left side has at least one corresponding row on the right side according to the join condition).\n**Transformations**: 1. Identify the INNER JOIN or LEFT JOIN condition in the SQL query. 2. Extract the ON clause representing the join condition. 3. For INNER JOIN: - Replace the INNER JOIN with a WHERE EXISTS clause, moving the original join condition into the WHERE clause of a subquery that selects from the right side table. Reference the left side columns as correlation variables in the subquery\'s WHERE clause. - Example Transformation: SELECT * FROM left_table INNER JOIN right_table ON left_table.id = right_table.foreign_id Becomes: SELECT * FROM left_table WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM right_table WHERE left_table.id = right_table.foreign_id) 4. For LEFT JOIN: - Replace the LEFT JOIN with a LEFT OUTER JOIN subquery that is correlated to the outer query. In the SELECT clause of the outer query, include a CASE statement or similar logic to handle selection from the subquery result. - Example Transformation: SELECT left_table.*, right_table.* FROM left_table LEFT JOIN right_table ON left_table.id = right_table.foreign_id Becomes: SELECT left_table.*, COALESCE(subquery.alias1, \'default\') FROM left_table LEFT OUTER JOIN (SELECT foreign_id, column1 AS alias1 FROM right_table) subquery ON left_table.id = subquery.foreign_id"""\n\n### Rule SORT_PROJECT_TRANSPOSE:\n"""**Conditions**: If a SQL query executes a sort operation on columns that are directly referenced in the SELECT list or through expressions that are strictly monotonic transformations of these columns, and the sort operation directly follows these projections (SELECT statements), the sort operation can be pushed to operate directly on the table (FROM clause) before the projection.\n**Transformations**: 1. Check Compatibility: Ensure both sort and project (SELECT and ORDER BY clauses) involve compatible operations that relate directly to the raw column data or involve monotonic transformations.\n2. Analyze Order By Fields: Verify that each column in the ORDER BY clause is directly represented in the SELECT list or is a derived column through a monotonic transformation (e.g., casting integers to floats where the order is preserved).\n3. Adjust SQL Query: Rewrite the query so that sorting (ORDER BY clause) is applied to the raw table data in the FROM clause rather than after the projection. This might involve introducing a subquery or CTE (Common Table Expression) where the sorting is applied first, followed by the projections.\n4.

The first strategy involves reordering the application of filter conditions to enhance performance. Initially, the query applied several filter conditions after executing a series of joins, which could lead to processing larger intermediate datasets. By moving conditions related to the `orders` and `lineitem` tables to be applied directly on these tables before the joins, the query reduces the number of rows involved in the joins, thus optimizing performance. This ensures that only relevant rows are joined, maintaining the query\'s correctness while enhancing efficiency. The second strategy simplifies the date range condition in the `WHERE` clause. Originally expressed as `o_orderdate >= date \'1993-11-01\' and o_orderdate < date \'1993-11-01\' + interval \'3\' month`, it is transformed into a more efficient form using the `SEARCH` function: `SEARCH($12(o_orderdate), Sarg[[1993-11-01..1994-02-01)])`. This logical simplification allows the query optimizer to potentially leverage index-based optimizations, improving performance by removing redundancy and unnecessary complexity in conditions."""\n\nQuery Rewrite Rules:\n### Rule FILTER_INTO_JOIN:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: This SQL query rewrite rule applies when a filter condition is placed on the result set of an INNER JOIN operation. The filter\'s expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there\'s a matching row in the non-preserving side\'s table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned."""\n\n### Rule FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains conditions that can be statically determined as always true (e.g., constant expressions like `1=1` or tautologies based on the column data types and constraints), then these conditions don\'t affect the result set.\n**Transformations**: Remove such conditions from the WHERE clause. If this results in an empty WHERE clause, remove the WHERE clause entirely.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause simplifies to conditions that are always false or involve comparisons with NULL in a way that the outcome is always false or NULL (e.g., `column != column` or `1=0`), indicating no rows can satisfy the filter.\n**Transformations**: Replace the query with one that selects no rows. This could be represented in different ways based on the SQL dialect. One universal method might be selecting from a dual table with a false condition.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains complex conditions that can be simplified based on known constraints, constants, or through logical simplification (e.g., `column IS NOT NULL AND column IS NOT NULL` simplifies to `column IS NOT NULL`).\n**Transformations**: Simplify the conditions according to logical rules and known constraints.

The first strategy involves reordering the application of filter conditions to enhance performance. Initially, the query applied several filter conditions after executing a series of joins, which could lead to processing larger intermediate datasets. By moving conditions related to the `orders` and `lineitem` tables to be applied directly on these tables before the joins, the query reduces the number of rows involved in the joins, thus optimizing performance. This ensures that only relevant rows are joined, maintaining the query\'s correctness while enhancing efficiency. The second strategy simplifies the date range condition in the `WHERE` clause. Originally expressed as `o_orderdate >= date \'1993-11-01\' and o_orderdate < date \'1993-11-01\' + interval \'3\' month`, it is transformed into a more efficient form using the `SEARCH` function: `SEARCH($12(o_orderdate), Sarg[[1993-11-01..1994-02-01)])`. This logical simplification allows the query optimizer to potentially leverage index-based optimizations, improving performance by removing redundancy and unnecessary complexity in conditions."""\n\nQuery Rewrite Rules:\n### Rule FILTER_INTO_JOIN:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: This SQL query rewrite rule applies when a filter condition is placed on the result set of an INNER JOIN operation. The filter\'s expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there\'s a matching row in the non-preserving side\'s table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned."""\n\n### Rule FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains conditions that can be statically determined as always true (e.g., constant expressions like `1=1` or tautologies based on the column data types and constraints), then these conditions don\'t affect the result set.\n**Transformations**: Remove such conditions from the WHERE clause. If this results in an empty WHERE clause, remove the WHERE clause entirely.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause simplifies to conditions that are always false or involve comparisons with NULL in a way that the outcome is always false or NULL (e.g., `column != column` or `1=0`), indicating no rows can satisfy the filter.\n**Transformations**: Replace the query with one that selects no rows. This could be represented in different ways based on the SQL dialect. One universal method might be selecting from a dual table with a false condition.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains complex conditions that can be simplified based on known constraints, constants, or through logical simplification (e.g., `column IS NOT NULL AND column IS NOT NULL` simplifies to `column IS NOT NULL`).\n**Transformations**: Simplify the conditions according to logical rules and known constraints. Remove redundancy and unnecessary complexity."""\n\nArranged Rule Sequence: ["FILTER_INTO_JOIN", "FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS"]\n\nUtilized Rules: ["FILTER_INTO_JOIN", "FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS"]\n\nUnutilized Rules: []'}], 'response': 'Step 1: Since there are no unutilized rules in the provided arrangement, we don\'t need to prioritize any unutilized potential rules over the utilized ones.
