When the `LIMIT` clause is used to fetch a specified number of rows.\n2. When `ORDER BY` is used in conjunction with `LIMIT` to sort and limit the number of rows retrieved, particularly when sorting can leverage an index.\n3. When `DISTINCT` is used along with `LIMIT` to quickly identify and return unique rows without scanning the full dataset.\n4. During the use of `GROUP BY`, where optimization might involve sorting or traversing indexes in order to efficiently compute group values without processing the entire dataset.\n5. When sorting a specific number of rows from a single table based on non-indexed columns, utilizing in-memory sorting (`filesort`) techniques.\n**Transformations**: The specific SQL transformations that emerge from applying these optimization rules are:\n1. Combining `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY` encourages the database engine to stop the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained, avoiding full table sorts.\n2. Using `LIMIT` with `DISTINCT` leads to an early termination of the search for unique rows as soon as the needed amount is gathered, reducing time and resources spent on scanning the entire dataset.\n3. In the context of `GROUP BY`, optimizations may include indexing strategies or modifications to the way sorting is handled, such as employing `filesort` mechanisms that do not require temporary tables, ensuring that the database engine processes only the necessary data for group computations.\n4. Efficiencies are gained by encouraging the use of indexed columns with `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT`, making queries more efficient by reducing the cost associated with sorting and filtering operations.\n"""\nRule 2:\n"""\n**Conditions**: The SQL query rewrite rule applies when there are:\n- Functions or operations (especially deterministic ones) within the SELECT, WHERE, JOIN conditions, or any part of the query that is executed multiple times for the same row.\n- The presence of potentially computationally expensive operations or function calls that are not dependent on the data of the specific row and thus can be optimized.\n**Transformations**: 1. Move repeated function calls or operations outside of loops, if applicable. For example, if a function that generates a calculated value based on constants or parameters (not row-specific data) is being called in a loop, calculate the value once before the loop and store the result for reuse.\n   \n2. Replace inline functions in the SELECT or WHERE clause with a pre-calculated column if the function is deterministic and the input data does not change frequently. This might involve:\n   - Creating a temporary table that includes the results of the expensive function calls.\n   - Using a subquery or a Common Table Expression (CTE) that calculates the value once and then joins it with the main query.\n   \n3. When using aggregate functions that are called multiple times with the same parameters, consider storing the result in a variable or a temporary table, especially if the data set is large.\n\n4. Avoid using functions on indexed columns in the WHERE clause. This prevents the database from using the index efficiently. If a function must be used, consider creating a computed column that pre-calculates the function\'s result and index that column instead.\n\n5. If possible, simplify expressions and calculations to reduce their complexity and execution time. This might involve algebraic simplification or breaking down complex calculations into simpler parts that can be calculated separately and then combined.\n\nExample:\nOriginal Query:\n```sql\nSELECT id, name, expensive_function(column) as expensive_result\nFROM table\nWHERE expensive_function(column) > 100;\n```\n\nTransformed Query using a CTE:\n```sql\nWITH PreCalculated AS (\n  SELECT id, name, column, expensive_function(column) as expensive_result\n  FROM table\n)\nSELECT id, name, expensive_sel as expensive_result\nFROM PreCalculated\nWHERE expensive_result > 100;\n```\n"""'}], 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'stream': False, 'temperature': 0.1}}

Similarly, the discount condition `>=($6(l_discount), -(0.06:DECIMAL(3, 2), 0.01:DECIMAL(3, 2)))` and `<=($6(l_discount), +(0.06:DECIMAL(3, 2), 0.01:DECIMAL(3, 2)))` have been replaced by `SEARCH($6(l_discount), Sarg[[0.05:DECIMAL(4, 2)..0.07:DECIMAL(4, 2)]]:DECIMAL(4, 2))`.\n\nStep 2: Parsing these changes into SQL query terms, the original SQL query had conditions in the WHERE clause that involved arithmetic operations to define ranges for `l_shipdate` and `l_discount`.

This matches Case 3 of the query rewrite rule, which deals with simplifying complex conditions based on logical simplification and known constraints.\n\nStep 4: In the SQL query, the original conditions for `l_shipdate` and `l_discount` involved arithmetic operations to define their respective ranges. The rewrite process identified that these conditions could be simplified into direct range checks using the `SEARCH` function. This simplification removed the need for arithmetic operations and directly expressed the conditions as range searches. This aligns with Case 3 of the query rewrite rule, which aims to simplify complex conditions by removing redundancy and unnecessary complexity. The transformation resulted in a more efficient query by directly specifying the ranges for `l_shipdate` and `l_discount`, thus optimizing the filter conditions in the WHERE clause.", 'time': 5.942017555236816}

03:15:55,45 root INFO Generated queries:
Query 1: In the SQL query, the original conditions for `l_shipdate` and `l_discount` involved arithmetic operations to define their respective ranges. The rewrite process identified that these conditions could be simplified into direct range checks using the `SEARCH` function. This simplification removed the need for arithmetic operations and directly expressed the conditions as range searches. This aligns with Case 3 of the query rewrite rule, which aims to simplify complex conditions by removing redundancy and unnecessary complexity. The transformation resulted in a more efficient query by directly specifying the ranges for `l_shipdate` and `l_discount`, thus optimizing the filter conditions in the WHERE clause.
Query 2: The SQL query can be optimized by applying Rule 2, which focuses on moving repeated deterministic operations outside of the query execution loop. In this query, the operations `date '1994-01-01' + interval '1' year` and `0.06 - 0.01` and `0.06 + 0.01` are deterministic and can be pre-calculated.

1. Pre-calculate `date '1994-01-01' + interval '1' year` to get `date '1995-01-01'`.
2. Pre-calculate `0.06 - 0.01` to get `0.05`.
3. Pre-calculate `0.06 + 0.01` to get `0.07`.

The transformed query becomes:
```sql
select
	sum(l_extendedprice * l_discount) as revenue
from
	lineitem
where
	l_shipdate >= date '1994-01-01'
	and l_shipdate < date '1995-01-01'
	and l_discount between 0.05 and 0.07
	and l_quantity < 24
limit 1;
```

By pre-calculating these values, the query execution can be slightly more efficient, as it reduces the need for the database engine to perform these calculations repeatedly for each row.

This rule focuses on simplifying the WHERE clause by removing redundancy and unnecessary complexity. In the given query, the condition `l_discount between 0.06 - 0.01 and 0.06 + 0.01` can be simplified to `l_discount between 0.05 and 0.07`. This simplification reduces the complexity of the condition.\n\n2. **Pre-calculating Deterministic Operations**: Although not explicitly mentioned as a separate rule, this strategy involves moving calculations outside the query execution loop. The operations `date \'1994-01-01\' + interval \'1\' year`, `0.06 - 0.01`, and `0.06 + 0.01` can be pre-calculated to `date \'1995-01-01\'`, `0.05`, and `0.07`, respectively.

The second strategy, based on Rule 2, focuses on moving repeated deterministic operations outside the query execution loop by pre-calculating them. Specifically, the operations `date \'1994-01-01\' + interval \'1\' year`, `0.06 - 0.01`, and `0.06 + 0.01` are pre-calculated to `date \'1995-01-01\'`, `0.05`, and `0.07`, respectively.

If this results in an empty WHERE clause, remove the WHERE clause entirely.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause simplifies to conditions that are always false or involve comparisons with NULL in a way that the outcome is always false or NULL (e.g., `column != column` or `1=0`), indicating no rows can satisfy the filter.\n**Transformations**: Replace the query with one that selects no rows.
