When the `LIMIT` clause is used to fetch a specified number of rows.\n2. When `ORDER BY` is used in conjunction with `LIMIT` to sort and limit the number of rows retrieved, particularly when sorting can leverage an index.\n3. When `DISTINCT` is used along with `LIMIT` to quickly identify and return unique rows without scanning the full dataset.\n4. During the use of `GROUP BY`, where optimization might involve sorting or traversing indexes in order to efficiently compute group values without processing the entire dataset.\n5. When sorting a specific number of rows from a single table based on non-indexed columns, utilizing in-memory sorting (`filesort`) techniques.\n**Transformations**: The specific SQL transformations that emerge from applying these optimization rules are:\n1. Combining `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY` encourages the database engine to stop the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained, avoiding full table sorts.\n2. Using `LIMIT` with `DISTINCT` leads to an early termination of the search for unique rows as soon as the needed amount is gathered, reducing time and resources spent on scanning the entire dataset.\n3. In the context of `GROUP BY`, optimizations may include indexing strategies or modifications to the way sorting is handled, such as employing `filesort` mechanisms that do not require temporary tables, ensuring that the database engine processes only the necessary data for group computations.\n4. Efficiencies are gained by encouraging the use of indexed columns with `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT`, making queries more efficient by reducing the cost associated with sorting and filtering operations.\n"""\nRule 4:\n"""\n**Conditions**: The SQL query rewrite rule applies when there are:\n- Functions or operations (especially deterministic ones) within the SELECT, WHERE, JOIN conditions, or any part of the query that is executed multiple times for the same row.\n- The presence of potentially computationally expensive operations or function calls that are not dependent on the data of the specific row and thus can be optimized.\n**Transformations**: 1. Move repeated function calls or operations outside of loops, if applicable. For example, if a function that generates a calculated value based on constants or parameters (not row-specific data) is being called in a loop, calculate the value once before the loop and store the result for reuse.\n   \n2. Replace inline functions in the SELECT or WHERE clause with a pre-calculated column if the function is deterministic and the input data does not change frequently. This might involve:\n   - Creating a temporary table that includes the results of the expensive function calls.\n   - Using a subquery or a Common Table Expression (CTE) that calculates the value once and then joins it with the main query.\n   \n3. When using aggregate functions that are called multiple times with the same parameters, consider storing the result in a variable or a temporary table, especially if the data set is large.\n\n4. Avoid using functions on indexed columns in the WHERE clause. This prevents the database from using the index efficiently. If a function must be used, consider creating a computed column that pre-calculates the function\'s result and index that column instead.\n\n5. If possible, simplify expressions and calculations to reduce their complexity and execution time. This might involve algebraic simplification or breaking down complex calculations into simpler parts that can be calculated separately and then combined.\n\nExample:\nOriginal Query:\n```sql\nSELECT id, name, expensive_function(column) as expensive_result\nFROM table\nWHERE expensive_function(column) > 100;\n```\n\nTransformed Query using a CTE:\n```sql\nWITH PreCalculated AS (\n  SELECT id, name, column, expensive_function(column) as expensive_result\n  FROM table\n)\nSELECT id, name, expensive_sel as expensive_result\nFROM PreCalculated\nWHERE expensive_result > 100;\n```\n"""'}], 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'stream': False, 'temperature': 0.1}}

The filter's expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there's a matching row in the non-preserving side's table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned.\n```\n\nLogical Plan Changes After Rewrite: ```\n  LogicalSort(sort0=[$0(l_shipmode)], dir0=[ASC], fetch=[1])\r\n    LogicalAggregate(group=[{0}], high_line_count=[SUM($1)], low_line_count=[SUM($2)])\r\n      LogicalProject(l_shipmode=[$23(l_shipmode)], $f1=[CASE(OR(=(CAST($5(o_orderpriority)):CHAR(8) NOT NULL, '1-URGENT'), =(CAST($5(o_orderpriority)):CHAR(6) NOT NULL, '2-HIGH')), 1, 0)], $f2=[CASE(AND(<>(CAST($5(o_orderpriority)):CHAR(8) NOT NULL, '1-URGENT'), <>(CAST($5(o_orderpriority)):CHAR(6) NOT NULL, '2-HIGH')), 1, 0)])\r\n+       LogicalJoin(condition=[=($0(o_orderkey), $9(l_orderkey))], joinType=[inner])\r\n-       LogicalFilter(condition=[AND(=($0(o_orderkey), $9(l_orderkey)), OR(=(CAST($23(l_shipmode)):CHAR(4) NOT NULL, 'SHIP'), =(CAST($23(l_shipmode)):CHAR(4) NOT NULL, 'RAIL')), <($20(l_commitdate), $21(l_receiptdate)), <($19(l_shipdate), $20(l_commitdate)), >=($21(l_receiptdate), 1995-01-01), <($21(l_receiptdate), +(1995-01-01, 12:INTERVAL YEAR)))])\r\n-         LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n-           LogicalTableScan(table=[[orders]])\r\n? --\n\n+         LogicalTableScan(table=[[orders]])\r\n+         LogicalFilter(condition=[AND(SEARCH(CAST($14(l_shipmode)):CHAR(4) NOT NULL, Sarg['RAIL', 'SHIP']:CHAR(4)), <($11(l_commitdate), $12(l_receiptdate)), <($10(l_shipdate), $11(l_commitdate)), >=($12(l_receiptdate), 1995-01-01), <($12(l_receiptdate), +(1995-01-01, 12:INTERVAL YEAR)))])\r\n            LogicalTableScan(table=[[lineitem]])\r\n  \n```"}], 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'stream': False, 'temperature': 0.1}}

The filter's expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there's a matching row in the non-preserving side's table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned.\n```\n\nLogical Plan Changes After Rewrite: ```\n  LogicalSort(sort0=[$0(l_shipmode)], dir0=[ASC], fetch=[1])\r\n    LogicalAggregate(group=[{0}], high_line_count=[SUM($1)], low_line_count=[SUM($2)])\r\n      LogicalProject(l_shipmode=[$23(l_shipmode)], $f1=[CASE(OR(=(CAST($5(o_orderpriority)):CHAR(8) NOT NULL, '1-URGENT'), =(CAST($5(o_orderpriority)):CHAR(6) NOT NULL, '2-HIGH')), 1, 0)], $f2=[CASE(AND(<>(CAST($5(o_orderpriority)):CHAR(8) NOT NULL, '1-URGENT'), <>(CAST($5(o_orderpriority)):CHAR(6) NOT NULL, '2-HIGH')), 1, 0)])\r\n+       LogicalJoin(condition=[=($0(o_orderkey), $9(l_orderkey))], joinType=[inner])\r\n-       LogicalFilter(condition=[AND(=($0(o_orderkey), $9(l_orderkey)), OR(=(CAST($23(l_shipmode)):CHAR(4) NOT NULL, 'SHIP'), =(CAST($23(l_shipmode)):CHAR(4) NOT NULL, 'RAIL')), <($20(l_commitdate), $21(l_receiptdate)), <($19(l_shipdate), $20(l_commitdate)), >=($21(l_receiptdate), 1995-01-01), <($21(l_receiptdate), +(1995-01-01, 12:INTERVAL YEAR)))])\r\n-         LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n-           LogicalTableScan(table=[[orders]])\r\n? --\n\n+         LogicalTableScan(table=[[orders]])\r\n+         LogicalFilter(condition=[AND(SEARCH(CAST($14(l_shipmode)):CHAR(4) NOT NULL, Sarg['RAIL', 'SHIP']:CHAR(4)), <($11(l_commitdate), $12(l_receiptdate)), <($10(l_shipdate), $11(l_commitdate)), >=($12(l_receiptdate), 1995-01-01), <($12(l_receiptdate), +(1995-01-01, 12:INTERVAL YEAR)))])\r\n            LogicalTableScan(table=[[lineitem]])\r\n  \n```"}], 'response': "Step 1: The logical plan changes indicate that the query rewrite rule has moved certain filter conditions from a `LogicalFilter` node that was applied after a `LogicalJoin` to a `LogicalFilter` node applied directly to the `lineitem` table before the join.

These conditions have been moved to a `LogicalFilter` applied directly to the `lineitem` table before the join operation.\n\nStep 3: The query rewrite rule contains multiple cases. In this scenario, Case 1 is applicable. The conditions in the `WHERE` clause of the original query only involve columns from the `lineitem` table, which is one side of the join. According to Case 1, such conditions can be moved to a `LogicalFilter` on the `lineitem` table before the join, optimizing the query by reducing the dataset size before the join operation.\n\nStep 4: The SQL query changes can be explained by Case 1 of the query rewrite rule. The original query had a `WHERE` clause that included conditions solely involving columns from the `lineitem` table.

By moving these conditions to a `LogicalFilter` applied directly to the `lineitem` table before the join, the query is optimized to filter the `lineitem` table first, reducing the number of rows that need to be joined with the `orders` table. This transformation aligns with the rule's guidance to apply filter conditions to the appropriate side of the join when they only involve columns from one table, thus improving query performance.", 'time': 4.788884162902832}

When the `LIMIT` clause is used to fetch a specified number of rows.\n2. When `ORDER BY` is used in conjunction with `LIMIT` to sort and limit the number of rows retrieved, particularly when sorting can leverage an index.\n3. When `DISTINCT` is used along with `LIMIT` to quickly identify and return unique rows without scanning the full dataset.\n4. During the use of `GROUP BY`, where optimization might involve sorting or traversing indexes in order to efficiently compute group values without processing the entire dataset.\n5. When sorting a specific number of rows from a single table based on non-indexed columns, utilizing in-memory sorting (`filesort`) techniques.\n**Transformations**: The specific SQL transformations that emerge from applying these optimization rules are:\n1. Combining `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY` encourages the database engine to stop the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained, avoiding full table sorts.\n2. Using `LIMIT` with `DISTINCT` leads to an early termination of the search for unique rows as soon as the needed amount is gathered, reducing time and resources spent on scanning the entire dataset.\n3. In the context of `GROUP BY`, optimizations may include indexing strategies or modifications to the way sorting is handled, such as employing `filesort` mechanisms that do not require temporary tables, ensuring that the database engine processes only the necessary data for group computations.\n4. Efficiencies are gained by encouraging the use of indexed columns with `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT`, making queries more efficient by reducing the cost associated with sorting and filtering operations.\n"""\nRule 4:\n"""\n**Conditions**: The SQL query rewrite rule applies when there are:\n- Functions or operations (especially deterministic ones) within the SELECT, WHERE, JOIN conditions, or any part of the query that is executed multiple times for the same row.\n- The presence of potentially computationally expensive operations or function calls that are not dependent on the data of the specific row and thus can be optimized.\n**Transformations**: 1. Move repeated function calls or operations outside of loops, if applicable. For example, if a function that generates a calculated value based on constants or parameters (not row-specific data) is being called in a loop, calculate the value once before the loop and store the result for reuse.\n   \n2. Replace inline functions in the SELECT or WHERE clause with a pre-calculated column if the function is deterministic and the input data does not change frequently. This might involve:\n   - Creating a temporary table that includes the results of the expensive function calls.\n   - Using a subquery or a Common Table Expression (CTE) that calculates the value once and then joins it with the main query.\n   \n3. When using aggregate functions that are called multiple times with the same parameters, consider storing the result in a variable or a temporary table, especially if the data set is large.\n\n4. Avoid using functions on indexed columns in the WHERE clause. This prevents the database from using the index efficiently. If a function must be used, consider creating a computed column that pre-calculates the function\'s result and index that column instead.\n\n5. If possible, simplify expressions and calculations to reduce their complexity and execution time. This might involve algebraic simplification or breaking down complex calculations into simpler parts that can be calculated separately and then combined.\n\nExample:\nOriginal Query:\n```sql\nSELECT id, name, expensive_function(column) as expensive_result\nFROM table\nWHERE expensive_function(column) > 100;\n```\n\nTransformed Query using a CTE:\n```sql\nWITH PreCalculated AS (\n  SELECT id, name, column, expensive_function(column) as expensive_result\n  FROM table\n)\nSELECT id, name, expensive_sel as expensive_result\nFROM PreCalculated\nWHERE expensive_result > 100;\n```\n"""'}], 'response': 'Step 1: Analyze the SQL query against each rewrite rule\'s conditions.\n\n- **Rule 1**: The query does not use NOT EXISTS, NOT IN, EXISTS, IN, or OR within JOINs and WHERE clauses.

02:39:55,427 root INFO Generated queries:
Query 1: The SQL query changes can be explained by Case 1 of the query rewrite rule. The original query had a `WHERE` clause that included conditions solely involving columns from the `lineitem` table. These conditions were: `l_shipmode in ('SHIP', 'RAIL')`, `l_commitdate < l_receiptdate`, `l_shipdate < l_commitdate`, `l_receiptdate >= date '1995-01-01'`, and `l_receiptdate < date '1995-01-01' + interval '1' year`. By moving these conditions to a `LogicalFilter` applied directly to the `lineitem` table before the join, the query is optimized to filter the `lineitem` table first, reducing the number of rows that need to be joined with the `orders` table. This transformation aligns with the rule's guidance to apply filter conditions to the appropriate side of the join when they only involve columns from one table, thus improving query performance.
Query 2: In the SQL query, the `WHERE` clause originally contained complex conditions for filtering `l_shipmode` and `l_receiptdate`. The rewrite rule applied logical simplification to these conditions:
- The `OR` condition for `l_shipmode` (`l_shipmode in ('SHIP', 'RAIL')`) was simplified to a `SEARCH` condition, which efficiently checks for membership in a set.
- The `AND` condition for `l_receiptdate` (`l_receiptdate >= date '1995-01-01' and l_receiptdate < date '1995-01-01' + interval '1' year`) was simplified to a `SEARCH` condition that checks for a range.
These transformations reduce redundancy and improve query performance by leveraging more efficient search operations, aligning with Case 3 of the query rewrite rule.
Query 3: The SQL query matches Rule 2 because it involves a `GROUP BY` operation along with a `JOIN`. To optimize the query, we can rearrange the operations to perform the `GROUP BY` before the `JOIN`. This can be achieved by using a subquery to pre-aggregate the data from the `lineitem` table before joining it with the `orders` table. This reduces the size of the dataset that needs to be joined, potentially improving performance.

Original Query:
```sql
select
	l_shipmode,
	sum(case
		when o_orderpriority = '1-URGENT'
			or o_orderpriority = '2-HIGH'
			then 1
		else 0
	end) as high_line_count,
	sum(case
		when o_orderpriority <> '1-URGENT'
			and o_orderpriority <> '2-HIGH'
			then 1
		else 0
	end) as low_line_count
from
	orders,
	lineitem
where
	o_orderkey = l_orderkey
	and l_shipmode in ('SHIP', 'RAIL')
	and l_commitdate < l_receiptdate
	and l_shipdate < l_commitdate
	and l_receiptdate >= date '1995-01-01'
	and l_receiptdate < date '1995-01-01' + interval '1' year
group by
	l_shipmode
order by
	l_shipmode
limit 1;
```

Transformed Query:
```sql
select
	l_shipmode,
	sum(case
		when o_orderpriority = '1-URGENT'
			or o_orderpriority = '2-HIGH'
			then 1
		else 0
	end) as high_line_count,
	sum(case
		when o_orderpriority <> '1-URGENT'
			and o_orderpriority <> '2-HIGH'
			then 1
		else 0
	end) as low_line_count
from
	(
		select l_orderkey, l_shipmode
		from lineitem
		where l_shipmode in ('SHIP', 'RAIL')
		and l_commitdate < l_receiptdate
		and l_shipdate < l_commitdate
		and l_receiptdate >= date '1995-01-01'
		and l_receiptdate < date '1995-01-01' + interval '1' year
		group by l_orderkey, l_shipmode
	) as pre_aggregated_lineitem
join orders on o_orderkey = pre_aggregated_lineitem.l_orderkey
group by l_shipmode
order by l_shipmode
limit 1;
```
This transformation performs the `GROUP BY` on the `lineitem` table first, reducing the dataset size before joining with the `orders` table.

Query Rewrite 1:
"""The SQL query changes can be explained by Case 1 of the query rewrite rule. The original query had a `WHERE` clause that included conditions solely involving columns from the `lineitem` table. These conditions were: `l_shipmode in ('SHIP', 'RAIL')`, `l_commitdate < l_receiptdate`, `l_shipdate < l_commitdate`, `l_receiptdate >= date '1995-01-01'`, and `l_receiptdate < date '1995-01-01' + interval '1' year`. By moving these conditions to a `LogicalFilter` applied directly to the `lineitem` table before the join, the query is optimized to filter the `lineitem` table first, reducing the number of rows that need to be joined with the `orders` table. This transformation aligns with the rule's guidance to apply filter conditions to the appropriate side of the join when they only involve columns from one table, thus improving query performance."""

Query Rewrite 2:
"""In the SQL query, the `WHERE` clause originally contained complex conditions for filtering `l_shipmode` and `l_receiptdate`. The rewrite rule applied logical simplification to these conditions:
- The `OR` condition for `l_shipmode` (`l_shipmode in ('SHIP', 'RAIL')`) was simplified to a `SEARCH` condition, which efficiently checks for membership in a set.
- The `AND` condition for `l_receiptdate` (`l_receiptdate >= date '1995-01-01' and l_receiptdate < date '1995-01-01' + interval '1' year`) was simplified to a `SEARCH` condition that checks for a range.
These transformations reduce redundancy and improve query performance by leveraging more efficient search operations, aligning with Case 3 of the query rewrite rule."""

Query Rewrite 3:
"""The SQL query matches Rule 2 because it involves a `GROUP BY` operation along with a `JOIN`. To optimize the query, we can rearrange the operations to perform the `GROUP BY` before the `JOIN`. This can be achieved by using a subquery to pre-aggregate the data from the `lineitem` table before joining it with the `orders` table. This reduces the size of the dataset that needs to be joined, potentially improving performance.

This reduces the number of rows that need to be joined with the `orders` table, enhancing performance. The second strategy involves rearranging the operations to perform a `GROUP BY` on the `lineitem` table before the join. By using a subquery to pre-aggregate data from the `lineitem` table, the dataset size is reduced prior to joining with the `orders` table, which can further improve query efficiency. Both strategies aim to minimize the amount of data processed during the join operation, thereby optimizing the query execution."""\n\n### Suggestion 2:\n"""In the SQL query, the `WHERE` clause originally contained complex conditions for filtering `l_shipmode` and `l_receiptdate`. The rewrite rule applied logical simplification to these conditions:\n- The `OR` condition for `l_shipmode` (`l_shipmode in (\'SHIP\', \'RAIL\')`) was simplified to a `SEARCH` condition, which efficiently checks for membership in a set.\n- The `AND` condition for `l_receiptdate` (`l_receiptdate >= date \'1995-01-01\' and l_receiptdate < date \'1995-01-01\' + interval \'1\' year`) was simplified to a `SEARCH` condition that checks for a range.\nThese transformations reduce redundancy and improve query performance by leveraging more efficient search operations, aligning with Case 3 of the query rewrite rule."""\n\n### Suggestion 3:\n"""The SQL query matches Rule 3 because it uses `LIMIT` in conjunction with `ORDER BY`. The rule suggests that combining `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY` encourages the database engine to stop the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained, avoiding full table sorts. In this case, the query already uses `ORDER BY l_shipmode` followed by `LIMIT 1`, which is an efficient way to retrieve the first row sorted by `l_shipmode`. No further transformation is necessary as the query already adheres to the optimization strategy suggested by Rule 3."""\n\nQuery Rewrite Rules:\n### Rule FILTER_INTO_JOIN:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: This SQL query rewrite rule applies when a filter condition is placed on the result set of an INNER JOIN operation. The filter\'s expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there\'s a matching row in the non-preserving side\'s table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned."""\n\n### Rule FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains conditions that can be statically determined as always true (e.g., constant expressions like `1=1` or tautologies based on the column data types and constraints), then these conditions don\'t affect the result set.\n**Transformations**: Remove such conditions from the WHERE clause. If this results in an empty WHERE clause, remove the WHERE clause entirely.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause simplifies to conditions that are always false or involve comparisons with NULL in a way that the outcome is always false or NULL (e.g., `column != column` or `1=0`), indicating no rows can satisfy the filter.\n**Transformations**: Replace the query with one that selects no rows. This could be represented in different ways based on the SQL dialect. One universal method might be selecting from a dual table with a false condition.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains complex conditions that can be simplified based on known constraints, constants, or through logical simplification (e.g., `column IS NOT NULL AND column IS NOT NULL` simplifies to `column IS NOT NULL`).\n**Transformations**: Simplify the conditions according to logical rules and known constraints.

The filter\'s expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there\'s a matching row in the non-preserving side\'s table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned."""\n\n### Rule FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains conditions that can be statically determined as always true (e.g., constant expressions like `1=1` or tautologies based on the column data types and constraints), then these conditions don\'t affect the result set.\n**Transformations**: Remove such conditions from the WHERE clause. If this results in an empty WHERE clause, remove the WHERE clause entirely.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause simplifies to conditions that are always false or involve comparisons with NULL in a way that the outcome is always false or NULL (e.g., `column != column` or `1=0`), indicating no rows can satisfy the filter.\n**Transformations**: Replace the query with one that selects no rows.

The first strategy involves applying filter conditions directly to the `lineitem` table before performing the join operation. This is achieved by moving conditions such as `l_shipmode in (\'SHIP\', \'RAIL\')`, `l_commitdate < l_receiptdate`, `l_shipdate < l_commitdate`, `l_receiptdate >= date \'1995-01-01\'`, and `l_receiptdate < date \'1995-01-01\' + interval \'1\' year` to a `LogicalFilter` on the `lineitem` table. This reduces the number of rows that need to be joined with the `orders` table, enhancing performance. The second strategy involves rearranging the operations to perform a `GROUP BY` on the `lineitem` table before the join. By using a subquery to pre-aggregate data from the `lineitem` table, the dataset size is reduced prior to joining with the `orders` table, which can further improve query efficiency. Both strategies aim to minimize the amount of data processed during the join operation, thereby optimizing the query execution."""\n\n### Suggestion 2:\n"""In the SQL query, the `WHERE` clause originally contained complex conditions for filtering `l_shipmode` and `l_receiptdate`. The rewrite rule applied logical simplification to these conditions:\n- The `OR` condition for `l_shipmode` (`l_shipmode in (\'SHIP\', \'RAIL\')`) was simplified to a `SEARCH` condition, which efficiently checks for membership in a set.\n- The `AND` condition for `l_receiptdate` (`l_receiptdate >= date \'1995-01-01\' and l_receiptdate < date \'1995-01-01\' + interval \'1\' year`) was simplified to a `SEARCH` condition that checks for a range.\nThese transformations reduce redundancy and improve query performance by leveraging more efficient search operations, aligning with Case 3 of the query rewrite rule."""\n\n### Suggestion 3:\n"""The SQL query matches Rule 3 because it uses `LIMIT` in conjunction with `ORDER BY`. The rule suggests that combining `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY` encourages the database engine to stop the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained, avoiding full table sorts. In this case, the query already uses `ORDER BY l_shipmode` followed by `LIMIT 1`, which is an efficient way to retrieve the first row sorted by `l_shipmode`. No further transformation is necessary as the query already adheres to the optimization strategy suggested by Rule 3."""\n\nQuery Rewrite Rules:\n### Rule FILTER_INTO_JOIN:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: This SQL query rewrite rule applies when a filter condition is placed on the result set of an INNER JOIN operation. The filter\'s expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there\'s a matching row in the non-preserving side\'s table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned."""\n\n### Rule FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains conditions that can be statically determined as always true (e.g., constant expressions like `1=1` or tautologies based on the column data types and constraints), then these conditions don\'t affect the result set.\n**Transformations**: Remove such conditions from the WHERE clause. If this results in an empty WHERE clause, remove the WHERE clause entirely.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause simplifies to conditions that are always false or involve comparisons with NULL in a way that the outcome is always false or NULL (e.g., `column != column` or `1=0`), indicating no rows can satisfy the filter.\n**Transformations**: Replace the query with one that selects no rows. This could be represented in different ways based on the SQL dialect. One universal method might be selecting from a dual table with a false condition.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains complex conditions that can be simplified based on known constraints, constants, or through logical simplification (e.g., `column IS NOT NULL AND column IS NOT NULL` simplifies to `column IS NOT NULL`).\n**Transformations**: Simplify the conditions according to logical rules and known constraints.

The rewrite rule applied logical simplification to these conditions:\n- The `OR` condition for `l_shipmode` (`l_shipmode in (\'SHIP\', \'RAIL\')`) was simplified to a `SEARCH` condition, which efficiently checks for membership in a set.\n- The `AND` condition for `l_receiptdate` (`l_receiptdate >= date \'1995-01-01\' and l_receiptdate < date \'1995-01-01\' + interval \'1\' year`) was simplified to a `SEARCH` condition that checks for a range.\nThese transformations reduce redundancy and improve query performance by leveraging more efficient search operations, aligning with Case 3 of the query rewrite rule."""\n\n### Suggestion 3:\n"""The SQL query matches Rule 3 because it uses `LIMIT` in conjunction with `ORDER BY`. The rule suggests that combining `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY` encourages the database engine to stop the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained, avoiding full table sorts. In this case, the query already uses `ORDER BY l_shipmode` followed by `LIMIT 1`, which is an efficient way to retrieve the first row sorted by `l_shipmode`. No further transformation is necessary as the query already adheres to the optimization strategy suggested by Rule 3."""\n\nQuery Rewrite Rules:\n### Rule FILTER_INTO_JOIN:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: This SQL query rewrite rule applies when a filter condition is placed on the result set of an INNER JOIN operation. The filter\'s expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there\'s a matching row in the non-preserving side\'s table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned."""\n\n### Rule FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains conditions that can be statically determined as always true (e.g., constant expressions like `1=1` or tautologies based on the column data types and constraints), then these conditions don\'t affect the result set.\n**Transformations**: Remove such conditions from the WHERE clause. If this results in an empty WHERE clause, remove the WHERE clause entirely.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause simplifies to conditions that are always false or involve comparisons with NULL in a way that the outcome is always false or NULL (e.g., `column != column` or `1=0`), indicating no rows can satisfy the filter.\n**Transformations**: Replace the query with one that selects no rows. This could be represented in different ways based on the SQL dialect. One universal method might be selecting from a dual table with a false condition.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains complex conditions that can be simplified based on known constraints, constants, or through logical simplification (e.g., `column IS NOT NULL AND column IS NOT NULL` simplifies to `column IS NOT NULL`).\n**Transformations**: Simplify the conditions according to logical rules and known constraints. Remove redundancy and unnecessary complexity."""\n\nArranged Rule Sequence: ["FILTER_INTO_JOIN", "FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS"]\n\nUtilized Rules: ["FILTER_INTO_JOIN", "FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS"]\n\nUnutilized Rules: []'}], 'response': 'Step 1: In the provided arrangement, all rules were utilized, and there are no unutilized rules.
