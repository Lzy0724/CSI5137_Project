When the `LIMIT` clause is used to fetch a specified number of rows.\n2. When `ORDER BY` is used in conjunction with `LIMIT` to sort and limit the number of rows retrieved, particularly when sorting can leverage an index.\n3. When `DISTINCT` is used along with `LIMIT` to quickly identify and return unique rows without scanning the full dataset.\n4. During the use of `GROUP BY`, where optimization might involve sorting or traversing indexes in order to efficiently compute group values without processing the entire dataset.\n5. When sorting a specific number of rows from a single table based on non-indexed columns, utilizing in-memory sorting (`filesort`) techniques.\n**Transformations**: The specific SQL transformations that emerge from applying these optimization rules are:\n1. Combining `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY` encourages the database engine to stop the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained, avoiding full table sorts.\n2. Using `LIMIT` with `DISTINCT` leads to an early termination of the search for unique rows as soon as the needed amount is gathered, reducing time and resources spent on scanning the entire dataset.\n3. In the context of `GROUP BY`, optimizations may include indexing strategies or modifications to the way sorting is handled, such as employing `filesort` mechanisms that do not require temporary tables, ensuring that the database engine processes only the necessary data for group computations.\n4. Efficiencies are gained by encouraging the use of indexed columns with `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT`, making queries more efficient by reducing the cost associated with sorting and filtering operations.\n"""\nRule 2:\n"""\n**Conditions**: The SQL query rewrite rule applies when there are:\n- Functions or operations (especially deterministic ones) within the SELECT, WHERE, JOIN conditions, or any part of the query that is executed multiple times for the same row.\n- The presence of potentially computationally expensive operations or function calls that are not dependent on the data of the specific row and thus can be optimized.\n**Transformations**: 1. Move repeated function calls or operations outside of loops, if applicable. For example, if a function that generates a calculated value based on constants or parameters (not row-specific data) is being called in a loop, calculate the value once before the loop and store the result for reuse.\n   \n2. Replace inline functions in the SELECT or WHERE clause with a pre-calculated column if the function is deterministic and the input data does not change frequently. This might involve:\n   - Creating a temporary table that includes the results of the expensive function calls.\n   - Using a subquery or a Common Table Expression (CTE) that calculates the value once and then joins it with the main query.\n   \n3. When using aggregate functions that are called multiple times with the same parameters, consider storing the result in a variable or a temporary table, especially if the data set is large.\n\n4. Avoid using functions on indexed columns in the WHERE clause. This prevents the database from using the index efficiently. If a function must be used, consider creating a computed column that pre-calculates the function\'s result and index that column instead.\n\n5. If possible, simplify expressions and calculations to reduce their complexity and execution time. This might involve algebraic simplification or breaking down complex calculations into simpler parts that can be calculated separately and then combined.\n\nExample:\nOriginal Query:\n```sql\nSELECT id, name, expensive_function(column) as expensive_result\nFROM table\nWHERE expensive_function(column) > 100;\n```\n\nTransformed Query using a CTE:\n```sql\nWITH PreCalculated AS (\n  SELECT id, name, column, expensive_function(column) as expensive_result\n  FROM table\n)\nSELECT id, name, expensive_sel as expensive_result\nFROM PreCalculated\nWHERE expensive_result > 100;\n```\n"""'}], 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'stream': False, 'temperature': 0.1}}

The filter's expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there's a matching row in the non-preserving side's table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned.\n```\n\nLogical Plan Changes After Rewrite: ```\n  LogicalSort(fetch=[1])\r\n    LogicalProject(promo_revenue=[/(*(100.00:DECIMAL(5, 2), $0), $1)])\r\n      LogicalAggregate(group=[{}], agg#0=[SUM($0)], agg#1=[SUM($1)])\r\n        LogicalProject($f0=[CASE(LIKE($20(p_type), 'PROMO%'), *($5(l_extendedprice), -(1, $6(l_discount))), 0:DECIMAL(19, 4))], $f1=[*($5(l_extendedprice), -(1, $6(l_discount)))])\r\n+         LogicalJoin(condition=[=($1(l_partkey), $16(p_partkey))], joinType=[inner])\r\n-         LogicalFilter(condition=[AND(=($1(l_partkey), $16(p_partkey)), >=($10(l_shipdate), 1996-02-01), <($10(l_shipdate), +(1996-02-01, 1:INTERVAL MONTH)))])\r\n?                                      ----------------------------------\n\n+           LogicalFilter(condition=[AND(>=($10(l_shipdate), 1996-02-01), <($10(l_shipdate), +(1996-02-01, 1:INTERVAL MONTH)))])\r\n? ++\n\n-           LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n              LogicalTableScan(table=[[lineitem]])\r\n-             LogicalTableScan(table=[[part]])\r\n? --\n\n+           LogicalTableScan(table=[[part]])\r\n  \n```"}], 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'stream': False, 'temperature': 0.1}}

Initially, the condition was `AND(=($1(l_partkey), $16(p_partkey)), >=($10(l_shipdate), 1996-02-01), <($10(l_shipdate), +(1996-02-01, 1:INTERVAL MONTH)))`. After the rewrite, it became `AND(=($1(l_partkey), $16(p_partkey)), SEARCH($10(l_shipdate), Sarg[[1996-02-01..1996-03-01)]))`. This indicates that the date range condition has been simplified using a `SEARCH` function with a Sargable range.\n\nStep 2: Parsing the logical plan changes, the SQL query's `WHERE` clause originally contained the conditions `l_partkey = p_partkey`, `l_shipdate >= date '1996-02-01'`, and `l_shipdate < date '1996-02-01' + interval '1' month'`. These conditions have been transformed into `l_partkey = p_partkey` and `l_shipdate` being within the range `[1996-02-01..1996-03-01)`. The transformation simplifies the date range condition into a single Sargable range expression.\n\nStep 3: The query rewrite rule contains multiple cases. The changes in the SQL query match Case 3 of the rewrite rule. Case 3 deals with simplifying complex conditions in the `WHERE` clause based on known constraints or logical simplifications. The transformation of the date range condition into a Sargable range expression is a simplification based on logical rules.\n\nStep 4: In this query rewrite process, the original `WHERE` clause contained a complex date range condition: `l_shipdate >= date '1996-02-01' and l_shipdate < date '1996-02-01' + interval '1' month'`. This condition was simplified to `SEARCH($10(l_shipdate), Sarg[[1996-02-01..1996-03-01)])`, which is a more efficient representation for query execution. This simplification falls under Case 3 of the rewrite rule, where complex conditions are simplified based on logical rules. The transformation improves query performance by making the date range condition Sargable, allowing for more efficient index utilization.", 'time': 5.079059839248657}

The filter's expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there's a matching row in the non-preserving side's table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned.\n```\n\nLogical Plan Changes After Rewrite: ```\n  LogicalSort(fetch=[1])\r\n    LogicalProject(promo_revenue=[/(*(100.00:DECIMAL(5, 2), $0), $1)])\r\n      LogicalAggregate(group=[{}], agg#0=[SUM($0)], agg#1=[SUM($1)])\r\n        LogicalProject($f0=[CASE(LIKE($20(p_type), 'PROMO%'), *($5(l_extendedprice), -(1, $6(l_discount))), 0:DECIMAL(19, 4))], $f1=[*($5(l_extendedprice), -(1, $6(l_discount)))])\r\n+         LogicalJoin(condition=[=($1(l_partkey), $16(p_partkey))], joinType=[inner])\r\n-         LogicalFilter(condition=[AND(=($1(l_partkey), $16(p_partkey)), >=($10(l_shipdate), 1996-02-01), <($10(l_shipdate), +(1996-02-01, 1:INTERVAL MONTH)))])\r\n?                                      ----------------------------------\n\n+           LogicalFilter(condition=[AND(>=($10(l_shipdate), 1996-02-01), <($10(l_shipdate), +(1996-02-01, 1:INTERVAL MONTH)))])\r\n? ++\n\n-           LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n              LogicalTableScan(table=[[lineitem]])\r\n-             LogicalTableScan(table=[[part]])\r\n? --\n\n+           LogicalTableScan(table=[[part]])\r\n  \n```"}], 'response': "Step 1: The logical plan changes indicate that the filter conditions on the `l_shipdate` column, which were initially applied after the join operation, have been moved to be applied before the join.

According to Case 1, these conditions can be moved to be applied directly to the `lineitem` table before the join operation. This transformation optimizes the query by reducing the size of the `lineitem` dataset before it is joined with the `part` table, thus potentially improving query performance by minimizing the amount of data processed in the join operation.", 'time': 5.641751289367676}

When `DISTINCT` is used along with `LIMIT` to quickly identify and return unique rows without scanning the full dataset.\n4.

When sorting a specific number of rows from a single table based on non-indexed columns, utilizing in-memory sorting (`filesort`) techniques.\n**Transformations**: The specific SQL transformations that emerge from applying these optimization rules are:\n1. Combining `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY` encourages the database engine to stop the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained, avoiding full table sorts.\n2. Using `LIMIT` with `DISTINCT` leads to an early termination of the search for unique rows as soon as the needed amount is gathered, reducing time and resources spent on scanning the entire dataset.\n3. In the context of `GROUP BY`, optimizations may include indexing strategies or modifications to the way sorting is handled, such as employing `filesort` mechanisms that do not require temporary tables, ensuring that the database engine processes only the necessary data for group computations.\n4. Efficiencies are gained by encouraging the use of indexed columns with `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT`, making queries more efficient by reducing the cost associated with sorting and filtering operations.\n"""\nRule 2:\n"""\n**Conditions**: The SQL query rewrite rule applies when there are:\n- Functions or operations (especially deterministic ones) within the SELECT, WHERE, JOIN conditions, or any part of the query that is executed multiple times for the same row.\n- The presence of potentially computationally expensive operations or function calls that are not dependent on the data of the specific row and thus can be optimized.\n**Transformations**: 1. Move repeated function calls or operations outside of loops, if applicable. For example, if a function that generates a calculated value based on constants or parameters (not row-specific data) is being called in a loop, calculate the value once before the loop and store the result for reuse.\n   \n2. Replace inline functions in the SELECT or WHERE clause with a pre-calculated column if the function is deterministic and the input data does not change frequently. This might involve:\n   - Creating a temporary table that includes the results of the expensive function calls.\n   - Using a subquery or a Common Table Expression (CTE) that calculates the value once and then joins it with the main query.\n   \n3. When using aggregate functions that are called multiple times with the same parameters, consider storing the result in a variable or a temporary table, especially if the data set is large.\n\n4. Avoid using functions on indexed columns in the WHERE clause. This prevents the database from using the index efficiently. If a function must be used, consider creating a computed column that pre-calculates the function\'s result and index that column instead.\n\n5. If possible, simplify expressions and calculations to reduce their complexity and execution time. This might involve algebraic simplification or breaking down complex calculations into simpler parts that can be calculated separately and then combined.\n\nExample:\nOriginal Query:\n```sql\nSELECT id, name, expensive_function(column) as expensive_result\nFROM table\nWHERE expensive_function(column) > 100;\n```\n\nTransformed Query using a CTE:\n```sql\nWITH PreCalculated AS (\n  SELECT id, name, column, expensive_function(column) as expensive_result\n  FROM table\n)\nSELECT id, name, expensive_sel as expensive_result\nFROM PreCalculated\nWHERE expensive_result > 100;\n```\n"""'}], 'response': 'Step 1: Analyze the given SQL query against the provided rewrite rules to identify applicable segments.\n\n- **Rule 1 Conditions**: \n  1.

02:42:25,200 root INFO Generated queries:
Query 1: The SQL query changes can be explained by Case 1 of the query rewrite rule. The original query had a `WHERE` clause that filtered the result set of an INNER JOIN between `lineitem` and `part` tables. The conditions in the `WHERE` clause (`l_shipdate >= date '1996-02-01' and l_shipdate < date '1996-02-01' + interval '1' month`) only involved columns from the `lineitem` table. According to Case 1, these conditions can be moved to be applied directly to the `lineitem` table before the join operation. This transformation optimizes the query by reducing the size of the `lineitem` dataset before it is joined with the `part` table, thus potentially improving query performance by minimizing the amount of data processed in the join operation.
Query 2: In this query rewrite process, the original `WHERE` clause contained a complex date range condition: `l_shipdate >= date '1996-02-01' and l_shipdate < date '1996-02-01' + interval '1' month'`. This condition was simplified to `SEARCH($10(l_shipdate), Sarg[[1996-02-01..1996-03-01)])`, which is a more efficient representation for query execution. This simplification falls under Case 3 of the rewrite rule, where complex conditions are simplified based on logical rules. The transformation improves query performance by making the date range condition Sargable, allowing for more efficient index utilization.
Query 3: The SQL query can be optimized by applying Rule 2, which suggests moving repeated deterministic operations outside of loops or calculating them once to avoid redundancy. In this query, the expression `l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)` is computed twice within the `SELECT` clause. We can optimize this by using a Common Table Expression (CTE) to calculate this expression once and then use it in the main query.

Original Query:
```sql
select
	100.00 * sum(case
		when p_type like 'PROMO%'
			then l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)
		else 0
	end) / sum(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)) as promo_revenue
from
	lineitem,
	part
where
	l_partkey = p_partkey
	and l_shipdate >= date '1996-02-01'
	and l_shipdate < date '1996-02-01' + interval '1' month
limit 1;
```

Transformed Query using a CTE:
```sql
WITH CalculatedPrices AS (
  SELECT
    l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount) as discounted_price,
    p_type
  FROM
    lineitem,
    part
  WHERE
    l_partkey = p_partkey
    AND l_shipdate >= date '1996-02-01'
    AND l_shipdate < date '1996-02-01' + interval '1' month
)
SELECT
  100.00 * SUM(CASE
    WHEN p_type LIKE 'PROMO%'
      THEN discounted_price
    ELSE 0
  END) / SUM(discounted_price) AS promo_revenue
FROM
  CalculatedPrices
LIMIT 1;
```

This transformation reduces the computational redundancy by calculating `l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)` once per row in the CTE, which is then reused in the main query. This can improve performance, especially on large datasets.

Query Rewrite 1:
"""The SQL query changes can be explained by Case 1 of the query rewrite rule. The original query had a `WHERE` clause that filtered the result set of an INNER JOIN between `lineitem` and `part` tables. The conditions in the `WHERE` clause (`l_shipdate >= date '1996-02-01' and l_shipdate < date '1996-02-01' + interval '1' month`) only involved columns from the `lineitem` table. According to Case 1, these conditions can be moved to be applied directly to the `lineitem` table before the join operation. This transformation optimizes the query by reducing the size of the `lineitem` dataset before it is joined with the `part` table, thus potentially improving query performance by minimizing the amount of data processed in the join operation."""

Query Rewrite 2:
"""In this query rewrite process, the original `WHERE` clause contained a complex date range condition: `l_shipdate >= date '1996-02-01' and l_shipdate < date '1996-02-01' + interval '1' month'`. This condition was simplified to `SEARCH($10(l_shipdate), Sarg[[1996-02-01..1996-03-01)])`, which is a more efficient representation for query execution. This simplification falls under Case 3 of the rewrite rule, where complex conditions are simplified based on logical rules. The transformation improves query performance by making the date range condition Sargable, allowing for more efficient index utilization."""

Query Rewrite 3:
"""The SQL query can be optimized by applying Rule 2, which suggests moving repeated deterministic operations outside of loops or calculating them once to avoid redundancy. In this query, the expression `l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)` is computed twice within the `SELECT` clause. We can optimize this by using a Common Table Expression (CTE) to calculate this expression once and then use it in the main query.

Original Query:
```sql
select
	100.00 * sum(case
		when p_type like 'PROMO%'
			then l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)
		else 0
	end) / sum(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)) as promo_revenue
from
	lineitem,
	part
where
	l_partkey = p_partkey
	and l_shipdate >= date '1996-02-01'
	and l_shipdate < date '1996-02-01' + interval '1' month
limit 1;
```

Transformed Query using a CTE:
```sql
WITH CalculatedPrices AS (
  SELECT
    l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount) as discounted_price,
    p_type
  FROM
    lineitem,
    part
  WHERE
    l_partkey = p_partkey
    AND l_shipdate >= date '1996-02-01'
    AND l_shipdate < date '1996-02-01' + interval '1' month
)
SELECT
  100.00 * SUM(CASE
    WHEN p_type LIKE 'PROMO%'
      THEN discounted_price
    ELSE 0
  END) / SUM(discounted_price) AS promo_revenue
FROM
  CalculatedPrices
LIMIT 1;
```

This transformation reduces the computational redundancy by calculating `l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)` once per row in the CTE, which is then reused in the main query. This can improve performance, especially on large datasets."""

The original query had a `WHERE` clause that filtered the result set of an INNER JOIN between `lineitem` and `part` tables. The conditions in the `WHERE` clause (`l_shipdate >= date \'1996-02-01\' and l_shipdate < date \'1996-02-01\' + interval \'1\' month`) only involved columns from the `lineitem` table. According to Case 1, these conditions can be moved to be applied directly to the `lineitem` table before the join operation. This transformation optimizes the query by reducing the size of the `lineitem` dataset before it is joined with the `part` table, thus potentially improving query performance by minimizing the amount of data processed in the join operation."""\n\nQuery Rewrite 2:\n"""In this query rewrite process, the original `WHERE` clause contained a complex date range condition: `l_shipdate >= date \'1996-02-01\' and l_shipdate < date \'1996-02-01\' + interval \'1\' month\'`. This condition was simplified to `SEARCH($10(l_shipdate), Sarg[[1996-02-01..1996-03-01)])`, which is a more efficient representation for query execution. This simplification falls under Case 3 of the rewrite rule, where complex conditions are simplified based on logical rules. The transformation improves query performance by making the date range condition Sargable, allowing for more efficient index utilization."""\n\nQuery Rewrite 3:\n"""The SQL query can be optimized by applying Rule 2, which suggests moving repeated deterministic operations outside of loops or calculating them once to avoid redundancy. In this query, the expression `l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)` is computed twice within the `SELECT` clause. We can optimize this by using a Common Table Expression (CTE) to calculate this expression once and then use it in the main query.\n\nOriginal Query:\n```sql\nselect\n\t100.00 * sum(case\n\t\twhen p_type like \'PROMO%\'\n\t\t\tthen l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)\n\t\telse 0\n\tend) / sum(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)) as promo_revenue\nfrom\n\tlineitem,\n\tpart\nwhere\n\tl_partkey = p_partkey\n\tand l_shipdate >= date \'1996-02-01\'\n\tand l_shipdate < date \'1996-02-01\' + interval \'1\' month\nlimit 1;\n```\n\nTransformed Query using a CTE:\n```sql\nWITH CalculatedPrices AS (\n  SELECT\n    l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount) as discounted_price,\n    p_type\n  FROM\n    lineitem,\n    part\n  WHERE\n    l_partkey = p_partkey\n    AND l_shipdate >= date \'1996-02-01\'\n    AND l_shipdate < date \'1996-02-01\' + interval \'1\' month\n)\nSELECT\n  100.00 * SUM(CASE\n    WHEN p_type LIKE \'PROMO%\'\n      THEN discounted_price\n    ELSE 0\n  END) / SUM(discounted_price) AS promo_revenue\nFROM\n  CalculatedPrices\nLIMIT 1;\n```\n\nThis transformation reduces the computational redundancy by calculating `l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)` once per row in the CTE, which is then reused in the main query.

The first strategy involves moving the date range conditions from the `WHERE` clause, which only involve the `lineitem` table, to be applied directly to the `lineitem` table before performing the join with the `part` table. This reduces the dataset size before the join, potentially enhancing performance by minimizing the data processed during the join operation. The second strategy simplifies the complex date range condition into a more efficient, Sargable form, which can improve query execution by allowing better index utilization. The third strategy addresses computational redundancy by using a Common Table Expression (CTE) to calculate the expression `l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)` once per row, rather than twice within the `SELECT` clause. This reduces redundant calculations and can improve performance, particularly with large datasets. Together, these strategies aim to optimize the query by reducing data processing and improving execution efficiency."""\n\nQuery Rewrite Rules:\n### Rule FILTER_INTO_JOIN:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: This SQL query rewrite rule applies when a filter condition is placed on the result set of an INNER JOIN operation. The filter\'s expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there\'s a matching row in the non-preserving side\'s table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned."""\n\n### Rule FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains conditions that can be statically determined as always true (e.g., constant expressions like `1=1` or tautologies based on the column data types and constraints), then these conditions don\'t affect the result set.\n**Transformations**: Remove such conditions from the WHERE clause. If this results in an empty WHERE clause, remove the WHERE clause entirely.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause simplifies to conditions that are always false or involve comparisons with NULL in a way that the outcome is always false or NULL (e.g., `column != column` or `1=0`), indicating no rows can satisfy the filter.\n**Transformations**: Replace the query with one that selects no rows. This could be represented in different ways based on the SQL dialect. One universal method might be selecting from a dual table with a false condition.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains complex conditions that can be simplified based on known constraints, constants, or through logical simplification (e.g., `column IS NOT NULL AND column IS NOT NULL` simplifies to `column IS NOT NULL`).\n**Transformations**: Simplify the conditions according to logical rules and known constraints. Remove redundancy and unnecessary complexity."""\n\n### Rule PROJECT_FILTER_TRANSPOSE:\n"""**Conditions**: This rewrite rule can be applied when an SQL query contains a SELECT operation (acting as the `Project` operation) followed by a WHERE clause (acting as the `Filter` operation), provided that the SELECT does not contain window functions (such as RANK(), ROW_NUMBER(), etc.) and the columns selected do not affect the outcome of the WHERE clause.\n**Transformations**: To apply the rule, refactor the SQL query so that the conditions in the WHERE clause are evaluated before the columns are selected in the SELECT clause. This may involve moving computations or column transformations from the SELECT clause to a sub-query that the WHERE clause is applied on, ensuring the final SELECT clause on the outermost query matches the original query\'s expected outcome. - Before: SELECT col1, transformation_function(col2) FROM table WHERE condition; - After: SELECT col1, transformation_function(col2) FROM (SELECT col1, col2 FROM table WHERE condition) AS subquery;"""\n\n### Rule AGGREGATE_REDUCE_FUNCTIONS:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: any SELECT statement or subquery using the AVG aggregate function\n**Transformations**: AVG(x) as SUM(x) / COUNT(x)\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: computing the population standard deviation\n**Transformations**: STDDEV_POP(x) as the square root of (`SUM(x^2) - SUM(x)^2 / COUNT(x)`) / COUNT(x)\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: for the sample standard deviation computation\n**Transformations**: STDDEV_SAMP(x) as the square root of (`SUM(x^2) - SUM(x)^2 / COUNT(x)`) / (COUNT(x) - 1)\nCase 4:\n**Conditions**: for the population variance computation\n**Transformations**: VAR_POP(x) as (`SUM(x^2) - SUM(x)^2 / COUNT(x)`) / COUNT(x)\nCase 5:\n**Conditions**: for the sample variance computation\n**Transformations**: VAR_SAMP(x) as (`SUM(x^2) - SUM(x)^2 / COUNT(x)`) / (COUNT(x) - 1)\nCase 6:\n**Conditions**: to compute population covariance\n**Transformations**: COVAR_POP(x, y) by applying a formula involving SUM and COUNT\nCase 7:\n**Conditions**: using a formula for sample covariance\n**Transformations**: COVAR_SAMP(x, y) using a formula involving SUM, COUNT, and an adjustment for sample calculations\nCase 8:\n**Conditions**: for transforming REGR_SXX(x, y) and REGR_SYY(x, y)\n**Transformations**: into expressions involving the computation of VAR_POP(x) or VAR_POP(y) respectively, multiplied by REGR_COUNT(x, y)"""\n\n### Rule JOIN_TO_CORRELATE:\n"""**Conditions**: The join type is either INNER JOIN or LEFT JOIN. There are no requirements in the query that would inherently create NULL values on the left side when there are no matching rows on the right side (for INNER JOIN, this condition is naturally met; for LEFT JOIN, it is met if every row on the left side has at least one corresponding row on the right side according to the join condition).\n**Transformations**: 1. Identify the INNER JOIN or LEFT JOIN condition in the SQL query. 2. Extract the ON clause representing the join condition. 3. For INNER JOIN: - Replace the INNER JOIN with a WHERE EXISTS clause, moving the original join condition into the WHERE clause of a subquery that selects from the right side table. Reference the left side columns as correlation variables in the subquery\'s WHERE clause. - Example Transformation: SELECT * FROM left_table INNER JOIN right_table ON left_table.id = right_table.foreign_id Becomes: SELECT * FROM left_table WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM right_table WHERE left_table.id = right_table.foreign_id) 4. For LEFT JOIN: - Replace the LEFT JOIN with a LEFT OUTER JOIN subquery that is correlated to the outer query. In the SELECT clause of the outer query, include a CASE statement or similar logic to handle selection from the subquery result. - Example Transformation: SELECT left_table.*, right_table.* FROM left_table LEFT JOIN right_table ON left_table.id = right_table.foreign_id Becomes: SELECT left_table.*, COALESCE(subquery.alias1, \'default\') FROM left_table LEFT OUTER JOIN (SELECT foreign_id, column1 AS alias1 FROM right_table) subquery ON left_table.id = subquery.foreign_id"""\n\n### Rule SORT_PROJECT_TRANSPOSE:\n"""**Conditions**: If a SQL query executes a sort operation on columns that are directly referenced in the SELECT list or through expressions that are strictly monotonic transformations of these columns, and the sort operation directly follows these projections (SELECT statements), the sort operation can be pushed to operate directly on the table (FROM clause) before the projection.\n**Transformations**: 1. Check Compatibility: Ensure both sort and project (SELECT and ORDER BY clauses) involve compatible operations that relate directly to the raw column data or involve monotonic transformations.\n2. Analyze Order By Fields: Verify that each column in the ORDER BY clause is directly represented in the SELECT list or is a derived column through a monotonic transformation (e.g., casting integers to floats where the order is preserved).\n3. Adjust SQL Query: Rewrite the query so that sorting (ORDER BY clause) is applied to the raw table data in the FROM clause rather than after the projection. This might involve introducing a subquery or CTE (Common Table Expression) where the sorting is applied first, followed by the projections.\n4. Optimize Projection: Ensure that the SELECT list in the outer query matches the original projection, applying on top of the sorted data now."""'}], 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'stream': False, 'temperature': 0.1}}

The second strategy simplifies the complex date range condition into a more efficient, Sargable form, which can improve query execution by allowing better index utilization. The third strategy addresses computational redundancy by using a Common Table Expression (CTE) to calculate the expression `l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)` once per row, rather than twice within the `SELECT` clause. This reduces redundant calculations and can improve performance, particularly with large datasets. Together, these strategies aim to optimize the query by reducing data processing and improving execution efficiency."""\n\nQuery Rewrite Rules:\n### Rule FILTER_INTO_JOIN:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: This SQL query rewrite rule applies when a filter condition is placed on the result set of an INNER JOIN operation. The filter\'s expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there\'s a matching row in the non-preserving side\'s table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned."""\n\n### Rule FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains conditions that can be statically determined as always true (e.g., constant expressions like `1=1` or tautologies based on the column data types and constraints), then these conditions don\'t affect the result set.\n**Transformations**: Remove such conditions from the WHERE clause. If this results in an empty WHERE clause, remove the WHERE clause entirely.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause simplifies to conditions that are always false or involve comparisons with NULL in a way that the outcome is always false or NULL (e.g., `column != column` or `1=0`), indicating no rows can satisfy the filter.\n**Transformations**: Replace the query with one that selects no rows.

The filter\'s expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there\'s a matching row in the non-preserving side\'s table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned."""\n\n### Rule FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains conditions that can be statically determined as always true (e.g., constant expressions like `1=1` or tautologies based on the column data types and constraints), then these conditions don\'t affect the result set.\n**Transformations**: Remove such conditions from the WHERE clause.

Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN.

For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned."""\n\n### Rule FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains conditions that can be statically determined as always true (e.g., constant expressions like `1=1` or tautologies based on the column data types and constraints), then these conditions don\'t affect the result set.\n**Transformations**: Remove such conditions from the WHERE clause.

The suggestions provided indicate three main strategies: moving filter conditions to reduce dataset size before joins, simplifying date range conditions for better index utilization, and reducing computational redundancy using a CTE.\n\nLet\'s analyze the rules and their sequences:\n\n1. **FILTER_INTO_JOIN**: This rule is crucial for moving filter conditions that only involve one table to be applied before the join. This aligns with the first strategy of reducing the dataset size before the join operation. This rule appears in both Rule Sequence 1 and Rule Sequence 2, indicating its importance and priority.\n\n2. **FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS**: This rule simplifies the WHERE clause by removing redundant or always-true conditions. It appears in Rule Sequence 1, suggesting it should be applied after FILTER_INTO_JOIN to further optimize the query by simplifying conditions.\n\n3. **PROJECT_FILTER_TRANSPOSE**: This rule involves reordering the SELECT and WHERE operations to ensure filters are applied before projections. It appears in Rule Sequence 3, indicating it should be applied after the other rules to ensure that any remaining filters are applied efficiently.\n\nGiven these observations, the overall sequence should prioritize moving filters into joins first, then simplifying expressions, and finally transposing projections and filters. This approach ensures that the dataset is minimized before joins, conditions are simplified, and filters are applied efficiently.\n\nTherefore, the optimal sequence for applying the rules is:\n\n1. **FILTER_INTO_JOIN**: Move applicable filters into the join to reduce dataset size early.\n2. **FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS**: Simplify the WHERE clause to remove redundant conditions.\n3. **PROJECT_FILTER_TRANSPOSE**: Reorder operations to apply filters before projections.\n\nThis sequence aligns with the provided rule subset sequences and the strategies outlined in the suggestions.\n\n```python\n["FILTER_INTO_JOIN", "FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS", "PROJECT_FILTER_TRANSPOSE"]\n```', 'time': 4.125670433044434}
