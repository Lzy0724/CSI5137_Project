When the `LIMIT` clause is used to fetch a specified number of rows.\n2. When `ORDER BY` is used in conjunction with `LIMIT` to sort and limit the number of rows retrieved, particularly when sorting can leverage an index.\n3. When `DISTINCT` is used along with `LIMIT` to quickly identify and return unique rows without scanning the full dataset.\n4. During the use of `GROUP BY`, where optimization might involve sorting or traversing indexes in order to efficiently compute group values without processing the entire dataset.\n5. When sorting a specific number of rows from a single table based on non-indexed columns, utilizing in-memory sorting (`filesort`) techniques.\n**Transformations**: The specific SQL transformations that emerge from applying these optimization rules are:\n1. Combining `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY` encourages the database engine to stop the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained, avoiding full table sorts.\n2. Using `LIMIT` with `DISTINCT` leads to an early termination of the search for unique rows as soon as the needed amount is gathered, reducing time and resources spent on scanning the entire dataset.\n3. In the context of `GROUP BY`, optimizations may include indexing strategies or modifications to the way sorting is handled, such as employing `filesort` mechanisms that do not require temporary tables, ensuring that the database engine processes only the necessary data for group computations.\n4. Efficiencies are gained by encouraging the use of indexed columns with `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT`, making queries more efficient by reducing the cost associated with sorting and filtering operations.\n"""\nRule 3:\n"""\n**Conditions**: The SQL query rewrite rule applies when there are:\n- Functions or operations (especially deterministic ones) within the SELECT, WHERE, JOIN conditions, or any part of the query that is executed multiple times for the same row.\n- The presence of potentially computationally expensive operations or function calls that are not dependent on the data of the specific row and thus can be optimized.\n**Transformations**: 1. Move repeated function calls or operations outside of loops, if applicable. For example, if a function that generates a calculated value based on constants or parameters (not row-specific data) is being called in a loop, calculate the value once before the loop and store the result for reuse.\n   \n2. Replace inline functions in the SELECT or WHERE clause with a pre-calculated column if the function is deterministic and the input data does not change frequently. This might involve:\n   - Creating a temporary table that includes the results of the expensive function calls.\n   - Using a subquery or a Common Table Expression (CTE) that calculates the value once and then joins it with the main query.\n   \n3. When using aggregate functions that are called multiple times with the same parameters, consider storing the result in a variable or a temporary table, especially if the data set is large.\n\n4. Avoid using functions on indexed columns in the WHERE clause. This prevents the database from using the index efficiently. If a function must be used, consider creating a computed column that pre-calculates the function\'s result and index that column instead.\n\n5. If possible, simplify expressions and calculations to reduce their complexity and execution time. This might involve algebraic simplification or breaking down complex calculations into simpler parts that can be calculated separately and then combined.\n\nExample:\nOriginal Query:\n```sql\nSELECT id, name, expensive_function(column) as expensive_result\nFROM table\nWHERE expensive_function(column) > 100;\n```\n\nTransformed Query using a CTE:\n```sql\nWITH PreCalculated AS (\n  SELECT id, name, column, expensive_function(column) as expensive_result\n  FROM table\n)\nSELECT id, name, expensive_sel as expensive_result\nFROM PreCalculated\nWHERE expensive_result > 100;\n```\n"""'}], 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'stream': False, 'temperature': 0.1}}

The filter's expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there's a matching row in the non-preserving side's table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned.\n```\n\nLogical Plan Changes After Rewrite: ```\n  LogicalSort(sort0=[$0(i_item_id)], sort1=[$1(s_state)], dir0=[ASC], dir1=[ASC], fetch=[100])\r\n    LogicalAggregate(group=[{0, 1}], groups=[[{0, 1}, {0}, {}]], g_state=[GROUPING($1)], agg1=[AVG($2)], agg2=[AVG($3)], agg3=[AVG($4)], agg4=[AVG($5)])\r\n      LogicalProject(i_item_id=[$90(i_item_id)], s_state=[$84(s_state)], ss_quantity=[$10(ss_quantity)], ss_list_price=[$12(ss_list_price)], ss_coupon_amt=[$19(ss_coupon_amt)], ss_sales_price=[$13(ss_sales_price)])\r\n-       LogicalFilter(condition=[AND(=($0(ss_sold_date_sk), $32(d_date_sk)), =($2(ss_item_sk), $89(i_item_sk)), =($7(ss_store_sk), $60(s_store_sk)), =($4(ss_cdemo_sk), $23(cd_demo_sk)), =(CAST($24(cd_gender)):CHAR(1), 'F'), =(CAST($25(cd_marital_status)):CHAR(1), 'S'), =(CAST($26(cd_education_status)):CHAR(11), '2 yr Degree'), =($38(d_year), 1999), =(CAST($84(s_state)):CHAR(2), 'KS'), =(CAST($101(i_category)):CHAR(5), 'Shoes'))])\r\n+       LogicalJoin(condition=[=($2(ss_item_sk), $89(i_item_sk))], joinType=[inner])\r\n-         LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n?                                  -\n\n+         LogicalJoin(condition=[=($7(ss_store_sk), $60(s_store_sk))], joinType=[inner])\r\n?                                +++++++++ +  ++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n-           LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n+           LogicalJoin(condition=[=($0(ss_sold_date_sk), $32(d_date_sk))], joinType=[inner])\r\n-             LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n?                                    ^^^\n\n+             LogicalJoin(condition=[=($4(ss_cdemo_sk), $23(cd_demo_sk))], joinType=[inner])\r\n?                                    ^^^^^^^^^^ ++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n-               LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n-                 LogicalTableScan(table=[[store_sales]])\r\n? --\n\n+               LogicalTableScan(table=[[store_sales]])\r\n+               LogicalFilter(condition=[AND(=(CAST($1(cd_gender)):CHAR(1), 'F'), =(CAST($2(cd_marital_status)):CHAR(1), 'S'), =(CAST($3(cd_education_status)):CHAR(11), '2 yr Degree'))])\r\n                  LogicalTableScan(table=[[customer_demographics]])\r\n+             LogicalFilter(condition=[=($6(d_year), 1999)])\r\n                LogicalTableScan(table=[[date_dim]])\r\n+           LogicalFilter(condition=[=(CAST($24(s_state)):CHAR(2), 'KS')])\r\n              LogicalTableScan(table=[[store]])\r\n+         LogicalFilter(condition=[=(CAST($12(i_category)):CHAR(5), 'Shoes')])\r\n            LogicalTableScan(table=[[item]])\r\n  \n```"}], 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'stream': False, 'temperature': 0.1}}

The `LogicalAggregate` operation has been moved to directly operate on the columns from the `LogicalFilter` without an intermediate `LogicalProject`. This suggests that the query rewrite rule has optimized the aggregation process by eliminating unnecessary projection layers.\n\nStep 2: Parsing the logical plan changes, we see that the original `LogicalAggregate` was aggregating on columns `i_item_id` and `s_state`, with aggregate functions `AVG` applied to `ss_quantity`, `ss_list_price`, `ss_coupon_amt`, and `ss_sales_price`. The `LogicalProject` was projecting these columns along with the `GROUPING` function result. After the rewrite, the `LogicalAggregate` directly uses the columns from the `LogicalFilter`, which applies the necessary joins and filters based on the `WHERE` clause conditions.\n\nStep 3: The query rewrite rule contains two cases. Case 1 involves simplifying the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions when there are no transformations or additional expressions in the `SELECT` clause. Case 2 involves removing an inner `SELECT` layer when it only serves as a passthrough. The parsed changes show that the `LogicalProject` layer, which was only renaming columns without transformations, has been eliminated. This matches Case 1, where the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions are directly applied to the data source.\n\nStep 4: In the SQL query, the `GROUP BY` clause groups by simple columns `i_item_id` and `s_state`, and the aggregate functions `AVG` operate directly on columns without expressions. The `SELECT` clause contains only the columns used in the `GROUP BY` and aggregates, without transformations. According to Case 1 of the query rewrite rule, the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions are directly applied to the data source, eliminating the outer projection layer that only renames columns. This optimization reduces the complexity of the logical plan by removing unnecessary operations, leading to a more efficient query execution.", 'time': 5.201322317123413}

The filter's expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there's a matching row in the non-preserving side's table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side.

The rewritten plan moves conditions closer to their respective tables, with conditions applied directly in `LogicalJoin` nodes or as separate `LogicalFilter` nodes before the joins.\n\nStep 2: Parsing the logical plan changes, we observe the following detailed changes:\n- The condition `ss_item_sk = i_item_sk` is moved from the `LogicalFilter` to the `LogicalJoin` between `store_sales` and `item`.\n- The condition `ss_store_sk = s_store_sk` is moved from the `LogicalFilter` to the `LogicalJoin` between `store_sales` and `store`.\n- The condition `ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk` is moved from the `LogicalFilter` to the `LogicalJoin` between `store_sales` and `date_dim`.\n- The condition `ss_cdemo_sk = cd_demo_sk` is moved from the `LogicalFilter` to the `LogicalJoin` between `store_sales` and `customer_demographics`.\n- The conditions `cd_gender = 'F'`, `cd_marital_status = 'S'`, and `cd_education_status = '2 yr Degree'` are moved to a `LogicalFilter` applied directly to `customer_demographics`.\n- The condition `d_year = 1999` is moved to a `LogicalFilter` applied directly to `date_dim`.\n- The condition `s_state = 'KS'` is moved to a `LogicalFilter` applied directly to `store`.\n- The condition `i_category = 'Shoes'` is moved to a `LogicalFilter` applied directly to `item`.\n\nStep 3: The query rewrite rule contains multiple cases. The changes observed in the logical plan match Case 1 of the query rewrite rule. This case applies when filter conditions can be logically associated with only one side of an INNER JOIN and can be moved into the ON clause of the join or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. The conditions moved in this rewrite are all associated with columns from one side of their respective joins, allowing them to be pushed down to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n\nStep 4: In this query rewrite process, the SQL query is optimized by pushing down filter conditions to their respective tables before the join operations. This is achieved by moving conditions such as `ss_item_sk = i_item_sk`, `ss_store_sk = s_store_sk`, `ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk`, and `ss_cdemo_sk = cd_demo_sk` into the ON clauses of their respective INNER JOINs. Additionally, conditions like `cd_gender = 'F'`, `cd_marital_status = 'S'`, `cd_education_status = '2 yr Degree'`, `d_year = 1999`, `s_state = 'KS'`, and `i_category = 'Shoes'` are applied directly to the tables `customer_demographics`, `date_dim`, `store`, and `item` respectively, as separate `LogicalFilter` nodes.

Replace inline functions in the SELECT or WHERE clause with a pre-calculated column if the function is deterministic and the input data does not change frequently.

When using aggregate functions that are called multiple times with the same parameters, consider storing the result in a variable or a temporary table, especially if the data set is large.\n\n4.

Query 1: In this query rewrite process, the SQL query is optimized by pushing down filter conditions to their respective tables before the join operations. This is achieved by moving conditions such as `ss_item_sk = i_item_sk`, `ss_store_sk = s_store_sk`, `ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk`, and `ss_cdemo_sk = cd_demo_sk` into the ON clauses of their respective INNER JOINs. Additionally, conditions like `cd_gender = 'F'`, `cd_marital_status = 'S'`, `cd_education_status = '2 yr Degree'`, `d_year = 1999`, `s_state = 'KS'`, and `i_category = 'Shoes'` are applied directly to the tables `customer_demographics`, `date_dim`, `store`, and `item` respectively, as separate `LogicalFilter` nodes. This transformation reduces the amount of data processed in the joins, improving query performance by filtering data earlier in the execution plan.
Query 2: In the SQL query, the `GROUP BY` clause groups by simple columns `i_item_id` and `s_state`, and the aggregate functions `AVG` operate directly on columns without expressions. The `SELECT` clause contains only the columns used in the `GROUP BY` and aggregates, without transformations. According to Case 1 of the query rewrite rule, the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions are directly applied to the data source, eliminating the outer projection layer that only renames columns. This optimization reduces the complexity of the logical plan by removing unnecessary operations, leading to a more efficient query execution.
Query 3: The SQL query can be optimized by applying Rule 1, which suggests rearranging the query to perform `GROUP BY` operations at the earliest stage. This can be achieved by using subqueries to pre-aggregate data before joining with other tables. Here's how the query can be rewritten:

1. Create a subquery that performs the `GROUP BY` operation on the `store_sales` table, aggregating the necessary columns (`ss_quantity`, `ss_list_price`, `ss_coupon_amt`, `ss_sales_price`) by `i_item_id` and `s_state`.

2. Join the result of this subquery with the other tables (`customer_demographics`, `date_dim`, `store`, `item`) to filter based on the conditions provided.

Rewritten Query:
```sql
WITH PreAggregatedSales AS (
  SELECT ss_item_sk, ss_store_sk, ss_cdemo_sk, ss_sold_date_sk,
         avg(ss_quantity) as agg1,
         avg(ss_list_price) as agg2,
         avg(ss_coupon_amt) as agg3,
         avg(ss_sales_price) as agg4
  FROM store_sales
  GROUP BY ss_item_sk, ss_store_sk, ss_cdemo_sk, ss_sold_date_sk
)
SELECT i_item_id, s_state, grouping(s_state) g_state,
       agg1, agg2, agg3, agg4
FROM PreAggregatedSales
JOIN customer_demographics ON PreAggregatedSales.ss_cdemo_sk = cd_demo_sk
JOIN date_dim ON PreAggregatedSales.ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
JOIN store ON PreAggregatedSales.ss_store_sk = s_store_sk

GROUP BY rollup (i_item_id, s_state)
ORDER BY i_item_id, s_state

```
This transformation reduces the size of the dataset early in the execution process, potentially improving performance by minimizing the workload on subsequent join operations.
Query 4: The SQL query can be optimized by applying Rule 2, which focuses on the use of `LIMIT` and `ORDER BY` to enhance performance. The query already uses `LIMIT` and `ORDER BY`, but we can ensure that the database engine efficiently processes these operations by encouraging the use of indexed columns.

1. Ensure that the columns used in `ORDER BY` (`i_item_id`, `s_state`) are indexed. This allows the database engine to quickly sort and limit the number of rows retrieved.

2. The `LIMIT` clause will encourage the database engine to stop the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained, avoiding full table sorts.

Since the query already uses `LIMIT` and `ORDER BY`, the main transformation involves ensuring that the columns involved are indexed to maximize efficiency. No structural changes to the query are necessary, but ensuring proper indexing can significantly enhance performance.

"""In this query rewrite process, the SQL query is optimized by pushing down filter conditions to their respective tables before the join operations. This is achieved by moving conditions such as `ss_item_sk = i_item_sk`, `ss_store_sk = s_store_sk`, `ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk`, and `ss_cdemo_sk = cd_demo_sk` into the ON clauses of their respective INNER JOINs. Additionally, conditions like `cd_gender = 'F'`, `cd_marital_status = 'S'`, `cd_education_status = '2 yr Degree'`, `d_year = 1999`, `s_state = 'KS'`, and `i_category = 'Shoes'` are applied directly to the tables `customer_demographics`, `date_dim`, `store`, and `item` respectively, as separate `LogicalFilter` nodes. This transformation reduces the amount of data processed in the joins, improving query performance by filtering data earlier in the execution plan."""

Query Rewrite 2:
"""In the SQL query, the `GROUP BY` clause groups by simple columns `i_item_id` and `s_state`, and the aggregate functions `AVG` operate directly on columns without expressions. The `SELECT` clause contains only the columns used in the `GROUP BY` and aggregates, without transformations. According to Case 1 of the query rewrite rule, the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions are directly applied to the data source, eliminating the outer projection layer that only renames columns. This optimization reduces the complexity of the logical plan by removing unnecessary operations, leading to a more efficient query execution."""

Query Rewrite 3:
"""The SQL query can be optimized by applying Rule 1, which suggests rearranging the query to perform `GROUP BY` operations at the earliest stage. This can be achieved by using subqueries to pre-aggregate data before joining with other tables. Here's how the query can be rewritten:

1. Create a subquery that performs the `GROUP BY` operation on the `store_sales` table, aggregating the necessary columns (`ss_quantity`, `ss_list_price`, `ss_coupon_amt`, `ss_sales_price`) by `i_item_id` and `s_state`.

2. Join the result of this subquery with the other tables (`customer_demographics`, `date_dim`, `store`, `item`) to filter based on the conditions provided.

Rewritten Query:
```sql
WITH PreAggregatedSales AS (
  SELECT ss_item_sk, ss_store_sk, ss_cdemo_sk, ss_sold_date_sk,
         avg(ss_quantity) as agg1,
         avg(ss_list_price) as agg2,
         avg(ss_coupon_amt) as agg3,
         avg(ss_sales_price) as agg4
  FROM store_sales
  GROUP BY ss_item_sk, ss_store_sk, ss_cdemo_sk, ss_sold_date_sk
)
SELECT i_item_id, s_state, grouping(s_state) g_state,
       agg1, agg2, agg3, agg4
FROM PreAggregatedSales
JOIN customer_demographics ON PreAggregatedSales.ss_cdemo_sk = cd_demo_sk
JOIN date_dim ON PreAggregatedSales.ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
JOIN store ON PreAggregatedSales.ss_store_sk = s_store_sk
JOIN item ON PreAggregatedSales.ss_item_sk = i_item_sk
WHERE cd_gender = 'F' AND cd_marital_status = 'S' AND cd_education_status = '2 yr Degree'
  AND d_year = 1999 AND s_state = 'KS' AND i_category = 'Shoes'
GROUP BY rollup (i_item_id, s_state)
ORDER BY i_item_id, s_state
LIMIT 100;
```
This transformation reduces the size of the dataset early in the execution process, potentially improving performance by minimizing the workload on subsequent join operations."""

Query Rewrite 4:
"""The SQL query can be optimized by applying Rule 2, which focuses on the use of `LIMIT` and `ORDER BY` to enhance performance. The query already uses `LIMIT` and `ORDER BY`, but we can ensure that the database engine efficiently processes these operations by encouraging the use of indexed columns.

1. Ensure that the columns used in `ORDER BY` (`i_item_id`, `s_state`) are indexed. This allows the database engine to quickly sort and limit the number of rows retrieved.

2. The `LIMIT` clause will encourage the database engine to stop the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained, avoiding full table sorts.

Since the query already uses `LIMIT` and `ORDER BY`, the main transformation involves ensuring that the columns involved are indexed to maximize efficiency. No structural changes to the query are necessary, but ensuring proper indexing can significantly enhance performance."""

The filter's expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there's a matching row in the non-preserving side's table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned."}, {'name': 'AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE', 'rewrite': 'Case 1:\n**Conditions**: - The SQL query contains a `GROUP BY` clause that groups by simple columns (no expressions in the `GROUP BY` list).\n- The aggregate functions in the `SELECT` clause operate directly on columns (no expressions inside the aggregate functions).\n- The `SELECT` clause only contains the columns used in the `GROUP BY` clause and the aggregates without any transformations or additional expressions.\n**Transformations**: - Directly apply the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions to the data source referred to in the `FROM` clause of the inner query before the projection.\n- Eliminate the outer projection layer if it only renames the columns without transforming them.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: - The `SELECT` clause of an outer query precisely matches the columns used in the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions of an inner query, without any column transformations or renamings.\n- The inner `SELECT` only serves as a passthrough for these columns.\n**Transformations**: - Remove the inner `SELECT` layer, directly applying the aggregate functions and `GROUP BY` to the original data source.'}], [], [{'name': 'PROJECT_FILTER_TRANSPOSE', 'rewrite': "**Conditions**: This rewrite rule can be applied when an SQL query contains a SELECT operation (acting as the `Project` operation) followed by a WHERE clause (acting as the `Filter` operation), provided that the SELECT does not contain window functions (such as RANK(), ROW_NUMBER(), etc.) and the columns selected do not affect the outcome of the WHERE clause.\n**Transformations**: To apply the rule, refactor the SQL query so that the conditions in the WHERE clause are evaluated before the columns are selected in the SELECT clause.

The filter\'s expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there\'s a matching row in the non-preserving side\'s table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned."""\n\n### Rule AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: - The SQL query contains a `GROUP BY` clause that groups by simple columns (no expressions in the `GROUP BY` list).\n- The aggregate functions in the `SELECT` clause operate directly on columns (no expressions inside the aggregate functions).\n- The `SELECT` clause only contains the columns used in the `GROUP BY` clause and the aggregates without any transformations or additional expressions.\n**Transformations**: - Directly apply the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions to the data source referred to in the `FROM` clause of the inner query before the projection.\n- Eliminate the outer projection layer if it only renames the columns without transforming them.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: - The `SELECT` clause of an outer query precisely matches the columns used in the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions of an inner query, without any column transformations or renamings.\n- The inner `SELECT` only serves as a passthrough for these columns.\n**Transformations**: - Remove the inner `SELECT` layer, directly applying the aggregate functions and `GROUP BY` to the original data source."""\n\n### Rule PROJECT_FILTER_TRANSPOSE:\n"""**Conditions**: This rewrite rule can be applied when an SQL query contains a SELECT operation (acting as the `Project` operation) followed by a WHERE clause (acting as the `Filter` operation), provided that the SELECT does not contain window functions (such as RANK(), ROW_NUMBER(), etc.) and the columns selected do not affect the outcome of the WHERE clause.\n**Transformations**: To apply the rule, refactor the SQL query so that the conditions in the WHERE clause are evaluated before the columns are selected in the SELECT clause.

The filter\'s expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there\'s a matching row in the non-preserving side\'s table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned."""\n\n### Rule AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: - The SQL query contains a `GROUP BY` clause that groups by simple columns (no expressions in the `GROUP BY` list).\n- The aggregate functions in the `SELECT` clause operate directly on columns (no expressions inside the aggregate functions).\n- The `SELECT` clause only contains the columns used in the `GROUP BY` clause and the aggregates without any transformations or additional expressions.\n**Transformations**: - Directly apply the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions to the data source referred to in the `FROM` clause of the inner query before the projection.\n- Eliminate the outer projection layer if it only renames the columns without transforming them.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: - The `SELECT` clause of an outer query precisely matches the columns used in the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions of an inner query, without any column transformations or renamings.\n- The inner `SELECT` only serves as a passthrough for these columns.\n**Transformations**: - Remove the inner `SELECT` layer, directly applying the aggregate functions and `GROUP BY` to the original data source."""'}], 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'stream': False, 'temperature': 0.1}}
