Replace IN with INTERSECT for querying intersecting datasets to potentially improve index usage and query speed.\n- Rewrite conditions using the OR operator into a series of UNION ALL operations to enhance code maintainability and performance.\n- Use EXCEPT instead of NOT IN or anti-joins to minimize duplicate row processing and optimize resource use, effectively reducing execution time.\n"""\nRule 2:\n"""\n**Conditions**: - The SQL query performs a `GROUP BY` operation along with other operations like `JOIN`.\n- Query performance could be enhanced by reducing the size of intermediate datasets.\n- Suitable for queries involving large datasets or attributes from Entity-Attribute-Value (EAV) tables.\n- Applicable when reordering the sequence of operations can lead to performance improvements.\n**Transformations**: - Rearrange the query to perform `GROUP BY` operations at the earliest stage, ideally before executing operations like `JOIN`.\n- Utilize subqueries for pre-aggregation to reduce the dataset size early in the execution process.\n- Directly restructure the query to prioritize grouping operations to minimize the workload on subsequent operations like `JOIN`, thereby enhancing overall execution speed and efficiency.\n"""\nRule 3:\n"""\n**Conditions**: The SQL query optimization rules apply under the following conditions:\n1. When the `LIMIT` clause is used to fetch a specified number of rows.\n2. When `ORDER BY` is used in conjunction with `LIMIT` to sort and limit the number of rows retrieved, particularly when sorting can leverage an index.\n3. When `DISTINCT` is used along with `LIMIT` to quickly identify and return unique rows without scanning the full dataset.\n4. During the use of `GROUP BY`, where optimization might involve sorting or traversing indexes in order to efficiently compute group values without processing the entire dataset.\n5. When sorting a specific number of rows from a single table based on non-indexed columns, utilizing in-memory sorting (`filesort`) techniques.\n**Transformations**: The specific SQL transformations that emerge from applying these optimization rules are:\n1. Combining `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY` encourages the database engine to stop the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained, avoiding full table sorts.\n2. Using `LIMIT` with `DISTINCT` leads to an early termination of the search for unique rows as soon as the needed amount is gathered, reducing time and resources spent on scanning the entire dataset.\n3. In the context of `GROUP BY`, optimizations may include indexing strategies or modifications to the way sorting is handled, such as employing `filesort` mechanisms that do not require temporary tables, ensuring that the database engine processes only the necessary data for group computations.\n4. Efficiencies are gained by encouraging the use of indexed columns with `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT`, making queries more efficient by reducing the cost associated with sorting and filtering operations.\n"""\nRule 4:\n"""\n**Conditions**: The SQL query rewrite rule applies when there are:\n- Functions or operations (especially deterministic ones) within the SELECT, WHERE, JOIN conditions, or any part of the query that is executed multiple times for the same row.\n- The presence of potentially computationally expensive operations or function calls that are not dependent on the data of the specific row and thus can be optimized.\n**Transformations**: 1. Move repeated function calls or operations outside of loops, if applicable. For example, if a function that generates a calculated value based on constants or parameters (not row-specific data) is being called in a loop, calculate the value once before the loop and store the result for reuse.\n   \n2. Replace inline functions in the SELECT or WHERE clause with a pre-calculated column if the function is deterministic and the input data does not change frequently. This might involve:\n   - Creating a temporary table that includes the results of the expensive function calls.\n   - Using a subquery or a Common Table Expression (CTE) that calculates the value once and then joins it with the main query.\n   \n3. When using aggregate functions that are called multiple times with the same parameters, consider storing the result in a variable or a temporary table, especially if the data set is large.\n\n4. Avoid using functions on indexed columns in the WHERE clause. This prevents the database from using the index efficiently. If a function must be used, consider creating a computed column that pre-calculates the function\'s result and index that column instead.\n\n5. If possible, simplify expressions and calculations to reduce their complexity and execution time. This might involve algebraic simplification or breaking down complex calculations into simpler parts that can be calculated separately and then combined.\n\nExample:\nOriginal Query:\n```sql\nSELECT id, name, expensive_function(column) as expensive_result\nFROM table\nWHERE expensive_function(column) > 100;\n```\n\nTransformed Query using a CTE:\n```sql\nWITH PreCalculated AS (\n  SELECT id, name, column, expensive_function(column) as expensive_result\n  FROM table\n)\nSELECT id, name, expensive_sel as expensive_result\nFROM PreCalculated\nWHERE expensive_result > 100;\n```\n"""\nRule 5:\n"""\n**Conditions**: The rule applies when the original SQL query performs multiple scans or joins on the same table to retrieve different attributes for certain conditions, or when the query structure results in redundant data processing and complexity that could be reduced.\n**Transformations**: - Combine multiple joins into a single join operation by using `CASE` statements to conditionally select different attributes from the table in one pass. \n- Use the `COALESCE` function in conjunction with `CASE` statements to efficiently merge conditional attributes into distinct columns based on specific criteria without the need for additional joins.\n- Optimize the selection of conditional attributes by integrating `GROUP BY` with aggregate functions like `MAX` within `CASE` statements, thus condensing the result set to only the necessary data and avoiding needless retrieval and processing steps.\n- The overall transformation leads to a single, more efficient query that accomplishes the tasks of multiple, less efficient operations, improving performance, and simplifying the query for better readability and maintenance.\n"""'}], 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'stream': False, 'temperature': 0.1}}

The filter\'s expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there\'s a matching row in the non-preserving side\'s table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned.\n```\n\nLogical Plan Changes After Rewrite: ```\n  LogicalSort(sort0=[$0], sort1=[$1], dir0=[ASC], dir1=[ASC], fetch=[100])\r\n    LogicalAggregate(group=[{0, 1}], groups=[[{0, 1}, {0}, {}]], sales=[SUM($2)], returns=[SUM($3)], profit=[SUM($4)])\r\n      LogicalUnion(all=[true])\r\n        LogicalUnion(all=[true])\r\n          LogicalProject(channel=[\'store channel\'], id=[||(\'store\', $0(s_store_id))], sales=[$1(ss_ext_sales_price)], returns=[$2(sr_return_amt)], profit=[$3])\r\n            LogicalAggregate(group=[{0}], sales=[SUM($1)], returns=[SUM($2)], profit=[SUM($3)])\r\n              LogicalProject(store_id=[$72(s_store_id)], ss_ext_sales_price=[$15(ss_ext_sales_price)], $f2=[CASE(IS NOT NULL($34(sr_return_amt)), CAST($34(sr_return_amt)):DECIMAL(12, 2) NOT NULL, 0:DECIMAL(12, 2))], $f3=[-($22(ss_net_profit), CASE(IS NOT NULL($42(sr_net_loss)), CAST($42(sr_net_loss)):DECIMAL(12, 2) NOT NULL, 0:DECIMAL(12, 2)))])\r\n-               LogicalFilter(condition=[AND(=($0(ss_sold_date_sk), $43(d_date_sk)), >=($45(d_date), CAST(\'1999-09-30\'):DATE NOT NULL), <=($45(d_date), +(CAST(\'1999-09-30\'):DATE NOT NULL, 2592000000:INTERVAL DAY)), =($7(ss_store_sk), $71(s_store_sk)), =($2(ss_item_sk), $100(i_item_sk)), >($105(i_current_price), 50), =($8(ss_promo_sk), $122(p_promo_sk)), =(CAST($131(p_channel_email)):CHAR(1), \'Y\'), =(CAST($133(p_channel_tv)):CHAR(1), \'Y\'), =(CAST($134(p_channel_radio)):CHAR(1), \'N\'), =(CAST($135(p_channel_press)):CHAR(1), \'Y\'), =(CAST($136(p_channel_event)):CHAR(1), \'Y\'), >=($11(ss_wholesale_cost), 74), <=($11(ss_wholesale_cost), 89), OR(=(CAST($112(i_category)):CHAR(5), \'Books\'), =(CAST($112(i_category)):CHAR(11), \'Electronics\')))])\r\n+               LogicalJoin(condition=[=($8(ss_promo_sk), $122(p_promo_sk))], joinType=[inner])\r\n-                 LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n?

Remove redundancy and unnecessary complexity.\n```\n\nLogical Plan Changes After Rewrite: ```\n  LogicalSort(sort0=[$0], sort1=[$1], dir0=[ASC], dir1=[ASC], fetch=[100])\r\n

If this results in an empty WHERE clause, remove the WHERE clause entirely.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause simplifies to conditions that are always false or involve comparisons with NULL in a way that the outcome is always false or NULL (e.g., `column != column` or `1=0`), indicating no rows can satisfy the filter.\n**Transformations**: Replace the query with one that selects no rows. This could be represented in different ways based on the SQL dialect. One universal method might be selecting from a dual table with a false condition.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains complex conditions that can be simplified based on known constraints, constants, or through logical simplification (e.g., `column IS NOT NULL AND column IS NOT NULL` simplifies to `column IS NOT NULL`).\n**Transformations**: Simplify the conditions according to logical rules and known constraints.

applied to simplify the conditions in the WHERE clause of the SQL query. Specifically, the changes involve the transformation of date range conditions and wholesale cost conditions into a more optimized form using `SEARCH` with `Sarg` (Search Argument).\n\nStep 2: Parsing the logical plan changes, we observe the following detailed changes in the SQL query:\n- The date range condition `d_date between cast('1999-09-30' as date) and cast('1999-09-30' as date) + interval '30' day` has been transformed into `SEARCH($d_date, Sarg[[1999-09-30..1999-10-30]])`.\n- The wholesale cost condition `ss_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 74 AND 89` has been transformed into `SEARCH($ss_wholesale_cost, Sarg[[74..89]])`.\n\nStep 3: The query rewrite rule contains multiple cases. The parsed SQL query changes match Case 3 of the query rewrite rule. Case 3 involves simplifying complex conditions based on known constraints or logical simplification. The transformation of the date range and wholesale cost conditions into `SEARCH` with `Sarg` is a form of logical simplification that optimizes the query execution.\n\nStep 4: In Case 3, the SQL query changes involve simplifying the WHERE clause conditions by replacing the explicit range conditions with `SEARCH` using `Sarg`. This transformation optimizes the query by making it easier for the database engine to evaluate the conditions efficiently. The date range condition `d_date between cast('1999-09-30' as date) and cast('1999-09-30' as date) + interval '30' day` is simplified to `SEARCH($d_date, Sarg[[1999-09-30..1999-10-30]])`, and the wholesale cost condition `ss_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 74 AND 89` is simplified to `SEARCH($ss_wholesale_cost, Sarg[[74..89]])`.

The SQL query performs a `GROUP BY` operation along with other operations like `JOIN`.\n- Query performance could be enhanced by reducing the size of intermediate datasets.\n- Suitable for queries involving large datasets or attributes from Entity-Attribute-Value (EAV) tables.\n- Applicable when reordering the sequence of operations can lead to performance improvements.\n**Transformations**: - Rearrange the query to perform `GROUP BY` operations at the earliest stage, ideally before executing operations like `JOIN`.\n- Utilize subqueries for pre-aggregation to reduce the dataset size early in the execution process.\n- Directly restructure the query to prioritize grouping operations to minimize the workload on subsequent operations like `JOIN`, thereby enhancing overall execution speed and efficiency.\n"""\nRule 3:\n"""\n**Conditions**: The SQL query optimization rules apply under the following conditions:\n1. When the `LIMIT` clause is used to fetch a specified number of rows.\n2. When `ORDER BY` is used in conjunction with `LIMIT` to sort and limit the number of rows retrieved, particularly when sorting can leverage an index.\n3. When `DISTINCT` is used along with `LIMIT` to quickly identify and return unique rows without scanning the full dataset.\n4. During the use of `GROUP BY`, where optimization might involve sorting or traversing indexes in order to efficiently compute group values without processing the entire dataset.\n5. When sorting a specific number of rows from a single table based on non-indexed columns, utilizing in-memory sorting (`filesort`) techniques.\n**Transformations**: The specific SQL transformations that emerge from applying these optimization rules are:\n1. Combining `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY` encourages the database engine to stop the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained, avoiding full table sorts.\n2. Using `LIMIT` with `DISTINCT` leads to an early termination of the search for unique rows as soon as the needed amount is gathered, reducing time and resources spent on scanning the entire dataset.\n3. In the context of `GROUP BY`, optimizations may include indexing strategies or modifications to the way sorting is handled, such as employing `filesort` mechanisms that do not require temporary tables, ensuring that the database engine processes only the necessary data for group computations.\n4. Efficiencies are gained by encouraging the use of indexed columns with `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT`, making queries more efficient by reducing the cost associated with sorting and filtering operations.\n"""\nRule 4:\n"""\n**Conditions**: The SQL query rewrite rule applies when there are:\n- Functions or operations (especially deterministic ones) within the SELECT, WHERE, JOIN conditions, or any part of the query that is executed multiple times for the same row.\n- The presence of potentially computationally expensive operations or function calls that are not dependent on the data of the specific row and thus can be optimized.\n**Transformations**: 1. Move repeated function calls or operations outside of loops, if applicable. For example, if a function that generates a calculated value based on constants or parameters (not row-specific data) is being called in a loop, calculate the value once before the loop and store the result for reuse.\n   \n2. Replace inline functions in the SELECT or WHERE clause with a pre-calculated column if the function is deterministic and the input data does not change frequently. This might involve:\n   - Creating a temporary table that includes the results of the expensive function calls.\n   - Using a subquery or a Common Table Expression (CTE) that calculates the value once and then joins it with the main query.\n   \n3. When using aggregate functions that are called multiple times with the same parameters, consider storing the result in a variable or a temporary table, especially if the data set is large.\n\n4. Avoid using functions on indexed columns in the WHERE clause. This prevents the database from using the index efficiently. If a function must be used, consider creating a computed column that pre-calculates the function\'s result and index that column instead.\n\n5. If possible, simplify expressions and calculations to reduce their complexity and execution time. This might involve algebraic simplification or breaking down complex calculations into simpler parts that can be calculated separately and then combined.\n\nExample:\nOriginal Query:\n```sql\nSELECT id, name, expensive_function(column) as expensive_result\nFROM table\nWHERE expensive_function(column) > 100;\n```\n\nTransformed Query using a CTE:\n```sql\nWITH PreCalculated AS (\n  SELECT id, name, column, expensive_function(column) as expensive_result\n  FROM table\n)\nSELECT id, name, expensive_sel as expensive_result\nFROM PreCalculated\nWHERE expensive_result > 100;\n```\n"""\nRule 5:\n"""\n**Conditions**: The rule applies when the original SQL query performs multiple scans or joins on the same table to retrieve different attributes for certain conditions, or when the query structure results in redundant data processing and complexity that could be reduced.\n**Transformations**: - Combine multiple joins into a single join operation by using `CASE` statements to conditionally select different attributes from the table in one pass. \n- Use the `COALESCE` function in conjunction with `CASE` statements to efficiently merge conditional attributes into distinct columns based on specific criteria without the need for additional joins.\n- Optimize the selection of conditional attributes by integrating `GROUP BY` with aggregate functions like `MAX` within `CASE` statements, thus condensing the result set to only the necessary data and avoiding needless retrieval and processing steps.\n- The overall transformation leads to a single, more efficient query that accomplishes the tasks of multiple, less efficient operations, improving performance, and simplifying the query for better readability and maintenance.\n"""'}], 'response': 'Step 1: Analyze the SQL query against each provided rewrite rule\'s conditions.\n\n- **Rule 1**: The query does not utilize traditional filtering mechanisms such as NOT EXISTS, NOT IN, EXISTS, IN, OR within JOINs and WHERE clauses.

For example, we can pre-aggregate the sales, returns, and profit calculations within each CTE (`ssr`, `csr`, `wsr`) before joining with other tables. This reduces the amount of data processed in subsequent joins and operations, enhancing overall execution speed and efficiency.\n"""\n\nQuery Rewrite 3:\n"""\nThe SQL query uses `LIMIT` in conjunction with `ORDER BY`, and it also involves `GROUP BY`. To optimize this, we can ensure that the database engine efficiently handles sorting and limiting operations. By combining `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY`, the database engine can stop the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained, avoiding full table sorts. Additionally, we can encourage the use of indexed columns with `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT` to make queries more efficient by reducing the cost associated with sorting and filtering operations. This optimization ensures that the database processes only the necessary data for group computations and limits the number of rows retrieved efficiently.\n"""', 'time': 5.354307413101196}

The filter\'s expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there\'s a matching row in the non-preserving side\'s table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned.\n```\n\nLogical Plan Changes After Rewrite: ```\n  LogicalSort(sort0=[$0], sort1=[$1], dir0=[ASC], dir1=[ASC], fetch=[100])\r\n    LogicalAggregate(group=[{0, 1}], groups=[[{0, 1}, {0}, {}]], sales=[SUM($2)], returns=[SUM($3)], profit=[SUM($4)])\r\n      LogicalUnion(all=[true])\r\n        LogicalUnion(all=[true])\r\n          LogicalProject(channel=[\'store channel\'], id=[||(\'store\', $0(s_store_id))], sales=[$1(ss_ext_sales_price)], returns=[$2(sr_return_amt)], profit=[$3])\r\n            LogicalAggregate(group=[{0}], sales=[SUM($1)], returns=[SUM($2)], profit=[SUM($3)])\r\n              LogicalProject(store_id=[$72(s_store_id)], ss_ext_sales_price=[$15(ss_ext_sales_price)], $f2=[CASE(IS NOT NULL($34(sr_return_amt)), CAST($34(sr_return_amt)):DECIMAL(12, 2) NOT NULL, 0:DECIMAL(12, 2))], $f3=[-($22(ss_net_profit), CASE(IS NOT NULL($42(sr_net_loss)), CAST($42(sr_net_loss)):DECIMAL(12, 2) NOT NULL, 0:DECIMAL(12, 2)))])\r\n-               LogicalFilter(condition=[AND(=($0(ss_sold_date_sk), $43(d_date_sk)), >=($45(d_date), CAST(\'1999-09-30\'):DATE NOT NULL), <=($45(d_date), +(CAST(\'1999-09-30\'):DATE NOT NULL, 2592000000:INTERVAL DAY)), =($7(ss_store_sk), $71(s_store_sk)), =($2(ss_item_sk), $100(i_item_sk)), >($105(i_current_price), 50), =($8(ss_promo_sk), $122(p_promo_sk)), =(CAST($131(p_channel_email)):CHAR(1), \'Y\'), =(CAST($133(p_channel_tv)):CHAR(1), \'Y\'), =(CAST($134(p_channel_radio)):CHAR(1), \'N\'), =(CAST($135(p_channel_press)):CHAR(1), \'Y\'), =(CAST($136(p_channel_event)):CHAR(1), \'Y\'), >=($11(ss_wholesale_cost), 74), <=($11(ss_wholesale_cost), 89), OR(=(CAST($112(i_category)):CHAR(5), \'Books\'), =(CAST($112(i_category)):CHAR(11), \'Electronics\')))])\r\n+               LogicalJoin(condition=[=($8(ss_promo_sk), $122(p_promo_sk))], joinType=[inner])\r\n-                 LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n?

Specifically, the conditions that were previously part of the WHERE clause have been moved into the ON clause of INNER JOINs. This is evident from the transformation of the LogicalFilter conditions into LogicalJoin conditions.\n\nStep 2: Parsing the logical plan changes, we observe the following detailed changes in the SQL query:\n- The conditions involving `ss_sold_date_sk`, `ss_store_sk`, `ss_item_sk`, `ss_promo_sk`, and similar columns for `cs_` and `ws_` prefixes have been moved from the WHERE clause to the ON clause of INNER JOINs.\n- The conditions `i_current_price > 50`, `p_channel_email = 'Y'`, `p_channel_tv = 'Y'`, `p_channel_radio = 'N'`, `p_channel_press = 'Y'`, `p_channel_event = 'Y'`, and `ss_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 74 AND 89` have been moved to LogicalFilter conditions applied directly to the respective tables before the join operations.\n\nStep 3: The query rewrite rule contains multiple cases. The changes observed in the logical plan match Case 1 of the query rewrite rule. This is because the filter conditions that were originally in the WHERE clause and only involved columns from one side of the join (e.g., `ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk`) have been moved into the ON clause of INNER JOINs. This transformation is consistent with the transformation described in Case 1, where conditions that can be logically associated with one side of the join are moved to the ON clause.\n\nStep 4: The SQL query changes can be explained as follows:\n- The original SQL query had filter conditions in the WHERE clause that were applicable only to one side of the join (e.g., `ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk`, `ss_store_sk = s_store_sk`, etc.). According to Case 1 of the query rewrite rule, these conditions can be moved into the ON clause of the INNER JOINs to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n- By moving these conditions into the ON clause, the query optimizer can potentially reduce the amount of data processed in the join operation, leading to more efficient query execution.\n- The transformation maintains the logical equivalence of the query while optimizing the execution plan by applying filters earlier in the query processing pipeline.", 'time': 6.267059564590454}
05:46:42,371 root INFO Generated queries:
Query 1: The SQL query changes can be explained as follows:
- The original SQL query had filter conditions in the WHERE clause that were applicable only to one side of the join (e.g., `ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk`, `ss_store_sk = s_store_sk`, etc.). According to Case 1 of the query rewrite rule, these conditions can be moved into the ON clause of the INNER JOINs to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.
- By moving these conditions into the ON clause, the query optimizer can potentially reduce the amount of data processed in the join operation, leading to more efficient query execution.
- The transformation maintains the logical equivalence of the query while optimizing the execution plan by applying filters earlier in the query processing pipeline.
Query 2: In Case 3, the SQL query changes involve simplifying the WHERE clause conditions by replacing the explicit range conditions with `SEARCH` using `Sarg`. This transformation optimizes the query by making it easier for the database engine to evaluate the conditions efficiently. The date range condition `d_date between cast('1999-09-30' as date) and cast('1999-09-30' as date) + interval '30' day` is simplified to `SEARCH($d_date, Sarg[[1999-09-30..1999-10-30]])`, and the wholesale cost condition `ss_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 74 AND 89` is simplified to `SEARCH($ss_wholesale_cost, Sarg[[74..89]])`. These changes reduce the complexity of the conditions and improve the performance of the query execution.
Query 3: The SQL query performs `GROUP BY` operations along with `JOIN` operations. To optimize this, we can rearrange the query to perform `GROUP BY` operations at the earliest stage, ideally before executing operations like `JOIN`. This can be achieved by using subqueries for pre-aggregation to reduce the dataset size early in the execution process. For example, we can pre-aggregate the sales, returns, and profit calculations within each CTE (`ssr`, `csr`, `wsr`) before joining with other tables. This reduces the amount of data processed in subsequent joins and operations, enhancing overall execution speed and efficiency.
Query 4: The SQL query uses `LIMIT` in conjunction with `ORDER BY`, and it also involves `GROUP BY`. To optimize this, we can ensure that the database engine efficiently handles sorting and limiting operations. By combining `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY`, the database engine can stop the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained, avoiding full table sorts. Additionally, we can encourage the use of indexed columns with `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT` to make queries more efficient by reducing the cost associated with sorting and filtering operations. This optimization ensures that the database processes only the necessary data for group computations and limits the number of rows retrieved efficiently.

Query Rewrite 1:
"""The SQL query changes can be explained as follows:
- The original SQL query had filter conditions in the WHERE clause that were applicable only to one side of the join (e.g., `ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk`, `ss_store_sk = s_store_sk`, etc.). According to Case 1 of the query rewrite rule, these conditions can be moved into the ON clause of the INNER JOINs to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.
- By moving these conditions into the ON clause, the query optimizer can potentially reduce the amount of data processed in the join operation, leading to more efficient query execution.
- The transformation maintains the logical equivalence of the query while optimizing the execution plan by applying filters earlier in the query processing pipeline."""

Query Rewrite 2:
"""In Case 3, the SQL query changes involve simplifying the WHERE clause conditions by replacing the explicit range conditions with `SEARCH` using `Sarg`. This transformation optimizes the query by making it easier for the database engine to evaluate the conditions efficiently. The date range condition `d_date between cast('1999-09-30' as date) and cast('1999-09-30' as date) + interval '30' day` is simplified to `SEARCH($d_date, Sarg[[1999-09-30..1999-10-30]])`, and the wholesale cost condition `ss_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 74 AND 89` is simplified to `SEARCH($ss_wholesale_cost, Sarg[[74..89]])`. These changes reduce the complexity of the conditions and improve the performance of the query execution."""

Query Rewrite 3:
"""The SQL query performs `GROUP BY` operations along with `JOIN` operations. To optimize this, we can rearrange the query to perform `GROUP BY` operations at the earliest stage, ideally before executing operations like `JOIN`. This can be achieved by using subqueries for pre-aggregation to reduce the dataset size early in the execution process. For example, we can pre-aggregate the sales, returns, and profit calculations within each CTE (`ssr`, `csr`, `wsr`) before joining with other tables. This reduces the amount of data processed in subsequent joins and operations, enhancing overall execution speed and efficiency."""

The filter's expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN.

The first strategy involves moving filter conditions from the WHERE clause to the ON clause of INNER JOINs. This adjustment allows the query optimizer to reduce the dataset size before the join operation, potentially leading to more efficient query execution by applying filters earlier in the processing pipeline. The second strategy focuses on rearranging the query to perform GROUP BY operations as early as possible, ideally before executing JOIN operations. This can be achieved by using subqueries for pre-aggregation within each Common Table Expression (CTE) to calculate sales, returns, and profit. By pre-aggregating data in CTEs (`ssr`, `csr`, `wsr`), the dataset size is reduced before subsequent joins and operations, enhancing execution speed and efficiency. Both strategies aim to maintain the logical equivalence of the query while optimizing its execution plan."""\n\n### Suggestion 2:\n"""In Case 3, the SQL query changes involve simplifying the WHERE clause conditions by replacing the explicit range conditions with `SEARCH` using `Sarg`. This transformation optimizes the query by making it easier for the database engine to evaluate the conditions efficiently. The date range condition `d_date between cast(\'1999-09-30\' as date) and cast(\'1999-09-30\' as date) + interval \'30\' day` is simplified to `SEARCH($d_date, Sarg[[1999-09-30..1999-10-30]])`, and the wholesale cost condition `ss_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 74 AND 89` is simplified to `SEARCH($ss_wholesale_cost, Sarg[[74..89]])`. These changes reduce the complexity of the conditions and improve the performance of the query execution."""\n\n### Suggestion 3:\n"""The SQL query uses `LIMIT` in conjunction with `ORDER BY`, and it also involves `GROUP BY`. To optimize this, we can ensure that the database engine efficiently handles sorting and limiting operations. By combining `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY`, the database engine can stop the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained, avoiding full table sorts. Additionally, we can encourage the use of indexed columns with `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT` to make queries more efficient by reducing the cost associated with sorting and filtering operations. This optimization ensures that the database processes only the necessary data for group computations and limits the number of rows retrieved efficiently."""\n\nQuery Rewrite Rules:\n### Rule FILTER_INTO_JOIN:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: This SQL query rewrite rule applies when a filter condition is placed on the result set of an INNER JOIN operation. The filter\'s expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there\'s a matching row in the non-preserving side\'s table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned."""\n\n### Rule FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains conditions that can be statically determined as always true (e.g., constant expressions like `1=1` or tautologies based on the column data types and constraints), then these conditions don\'t affect the result set.\n**Transformations**: Remove such conditions from the WHERE clause.

The first strategy involves moving filter conditions from the WHERE clause to the ON clause of INNER JOINs. This adjustment allows the query optimizer to reduce the dataset size before the join operation, potentially leading to more efficient query execution by applying filters earlier in the processing pipeline. The second strategy focuses on rearranging the query to perform GROUP BY operations as early as possible, ideally before executing JOIN operations. This can be achieved by using subqueries for pre-aggregation within each Common Table Expression (CTE) to calculate sales, returns, and profit. By pre-aggregating data in CTEs (`ssr`, `csr`, `wsr`), the dataset size is reduced before subsequent joins and operations, enhancing execution speed and efficiency. Both strategies aim to maintain the logical equivalence of the query while optimizing its execution plan."""\n\n### Suggestion 2:\n"""In Case 3, the SQL query changes involve simplifying the WHERE clause conditions by replacing the explicit range conditions with `SEARCH` using `Sarg`. This transformation optimizes the query by making it easier for the database engine to evaluate the conditions efficiently. The date range condition `d_date between cast(\'1999-09-30\' as date) and cast(\'1999-09-30\' as date) + interval \'30\' day` is simplified to `SEARCH($d_date, Sarg[[1999-09-30..1999-10-30]])`, and the wholesale cost condition `ss_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 74 AND 89` is simplified to `SEARCH($ss_wholesale_cost, Sarg[[74..89]])`. These changes reduce the complexity of the conditions and improve the performance of the query execution."""\n\n### Suggestion 3:\n"""The SQL query uses `LIMIT` in conjunction with `ORDER BY`, and it also involves `GROUP BY`. To optimize this, we can ensure that the database engine efficiently handles sorting and limiting operations. By combining `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY`, the database engine can stop the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained, avoiding full table sorts. Additionally, we can encourage the use of indexed columns with `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT` to make queries more efficient by reducing the cost associated with sorting and filtering operations. This optimization ensures that the database processes only the necessary data for group computations and limits the number of rows retrieved efficiently."""\n\nQuery Rewrite Rules:\n### Rule FILTER_INTO_JOIN:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: This SQL query rewrite rule applies when a filter condition is placed on the result set of an INNER JOIN operation. The filter\'s expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there\'s a matching row in the non-preserving side\'s table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned."""\n\n### Rule FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains conditions that can be statically determined as always true (e.g., constant expressions like `1=1` or tautologies based on the column data types and constraints), then these conditions don\'t affect the result set.\n**Transformations**: Remove such conditions from the WHERE clause. If this results in an empty WHERE clause, remove the WHERE clause entirely.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause simplifies to conditions that are always false or involve comparisons with NULL in a way that the outcome is always false or NULL (e.g., `column != column` or `1=0`), indicating no rows can satisfy the filter.\n**Transformations**: Replace the query with one that selects no rows. This could be represented in different ways based on the SQL dialect. One universal method might be selecting from a dual table with a false condition.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains complex conditions that can be simplified based on known constraints, constants, or through logical simplification (e.g., `column IS NOT NULL AND column IS NOT NULL` simplifies to `column IS NOT NULL`).\n**Transformations**: Simplify the conditions according to logical rules and known constraints. Remove redundancy and unnecessary complexity."""\n\n### Rule PROJECT_FILTER_TRANSPOSE:\n"""**Conditions**: This rewrite rule can be applied when an SQL query contains a SELECT operation (acting as the `Project` operation) followed by a WHERE clause (acting as the `Filter` operation), provided that the SELECT does not contain window functions (such as RANK(), ROW_NUMBER(), etc.) and the columns selected do not affect the outcome of the WHERE clause.\n**Transformations**: To apply the rule, refactor the SQL query so that the conditions in the WHERE clause are evaluated before the columns are selected in the SELECT clause. This may involve moving computations or column transformations from the SELECT clause to a sub-query that the WHERE clause is applied on, ensuring the final SELECT clause on the outermost query matches the original query\'s expected outcome. - Before: SELECT col1, transformation_function(col2) FROM table WHERE condition; - After: SELECT col1, transformation_function(col2) FROM (SELECT col1, col2 FROM table WHERE condition) AS subquery;"""\n\n### Rule AGGREGATE_REDUCE_FUNCTIONS:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: any SELECT statement or subquery using the AVG aggregate function\n**Transformations**: AVG(x) as SUM(x) / COUNT(x)\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: computing the population standard deviation\n**Transformations**: STDDEV_POP(x) as the square root of (`SUM(x^2) - SUM(x)^2 / COUNT(x)`) / COUNT(x)\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: for the sample standard deviation computation\n**Transformations**: STDDEV_SAMP(x) as the square root of (`SUM(x^2) - SUM(x)^2 / COUNT(x)`) / (COUNT(x) - 1)\nCase 4:\n**Conditions**: for the population variance computation\n**Transformations**: VAR_POP(x) as (`SUM(x^2) - SUM(x)^2 / COUNT(x)`) / COUNT(x)\nCase 5:\n**Conditions**: for the sample variance computation\n**Transformations**: VAR_SAMP(x) as (`SUM(x^2) - SUM(x)^2 / COUNT(x)`) / (COUNT(x) - 1)\nCase 6:\n**Conditions**: to compute population covariance\n**Transformations**: COVAR_POP(x, y) by applying a formula involving SUM and COUNT\nCase 7:\n**Conditions**: using a formula for sample covariance\n**Transformations**: COVAR_SAMP(x, y) using a formula involving SUM, COUNT, and an adjustment for sample calculations\nCase 8:\n**Conditions**: for transforming REGR_SXX(x, y) and REGR_SYY(x, y)\n**Transformations**: into expressions involving the computation of VAR_POP(x) or VAR_POP(y) respectively, multiplied by REGR_COUNT(x, y)"""\n\n### Rule JOIN_TO_CORRELATE:\n"""**Conditions**: The join type is either INNER JOIN or LEFT JOIN. There are no requirements in the query that would inherently create NULL values on the left side when there are no matching rows on the right side (for INNER JOIN, this condition is naturally met; for LEFT JOIN, it is met if every row on the left side has at least one corresponding row on the right side according to the join condition).\n**Transformations**: 1. Identify the INNER JOIN or LEFT JOIN condition in the SQL query. 2. Extract the ON clause representing the join condition. 3. For INNER JOIN: - Replace the INNER JOIN with a WHERE EXISTS clause, moving the original join condition into the WHERE clause of a subquery that selects from the right side table. Reference the left side columns as correlation variables in the subquery\'s WHERE clause. - Example Transformation: SELECT * FROM left_table INNER JOIN right_table ON left_table.id = right_table.foreign_id Becomes: SELECT * FROM left_table WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM right_table WHERE left_table.id = right_table.foreign_id) 4. For LEFT JOIN: - Replace the LEFT JOIN with a LEFT OUTER JOIN subquery that is correlated to the outer query. In the SELECT clause of the outer query, include a CASE statement or similar logic to handle selection from the subquery result. - Example Transformation: SELECT left_table.*, right_table.* FROM left_table LEFT JOIN right_table ON left_table.id = right_table.foreign_id Becomes: SELECT left_table.*, COALESCE(subquery.alias1, \'default\') FROM left_table LEFT OUTER JOIN (SELECT foreign_id, column1 AS alias1 FROM right_table) subquery ON left_table.id = subquery.foreign_id"""\n\n### Rule AGGREGATE_UNION_TRANSPOSE:\n"""**Conditions**: 1. The SQL query contains an aggregate function (e.g., `SUM()`, `COUNT()`) applied after a `UNION ALL` operation. \n2. The `UNION ALL` operation does not inherently ensure uniqueness across its inputs that would affect the correctness of aggregate functions if they were pushed down (validation of this condition might require schema or data analysis beyond simple SQL transformation logic).\n**Transformations**: 1. **Validation:** Ensure the SQL query involves a `UNION ALL` directly followed by an aggregate operation, and that pushing down the aggregate will not change the semantics of the query incorrectly (e.g., aggregating over unique rows that become non-unique after the `UNION ALL`). \n2. **Transforming Aggregate Functions:** For aggregate functions like `COUNT()`, modify them to ensure their correctness when applied after `UNION ALL`. This often involves changing `COUNT()` to `SUM()` around an indicator for non-null rows if `COUNT()` is used. \n3. **Applying Transformation:** \n- Identify each select query (or subquery) involved in the `UNION ALL` operation. \n- Apply an aggregate operation similar to the original operation directly within each of these subqueries. This might involve wrapping each subquery in an additional `SELECT` statement that performs the aggregations. \n- Use `UNION ALL` to combine these newly aggregated subqueries. \n- Apply a final aggregate operation on top of the combined results. This operation should ensure overall query semantics remain unchanged, particularly regarding group by keys, which might require adjustments to match the aggregated data\'s new structure. \n\n- **Example Transformation:** For a query that originally looks like: \n```sql \nSELECT COUNT(*) FROM ( \n  SELECT column1 FROM table1 \n  UNION ALL \n  SELECT column1 FROM table2 \n) subquery \n``` \nTransform it into: \n```sql \nSELECT SUM(subquery_count) FROM ( \n  SELECT COUNT(*) as subquery_count FROM table1 \n  UNION ALL \n  SELECT COUNT(*) as subquery_count FROM table2 \n) subquery \n``` \nThis corrects the usage of `COUNT()` by switching to a `SUM()` of counts from each part of the union, assuming `COUNT()` semantics are desired across the `UNION ALL`."""'}], 'response': 'Step 1: Evaluate each suggestion against the provided query rewrite rules.\n\n### Suggestion 1:\n- **Moving filter conditions from WHERE to ON clause of INNER JOINs**: This aligns with the `FILTER_INTO_JOIN` rule, specifically Case 1, where conditions from the WHERE clause can be moved to the ON clause of INNER JOINs.\n- **Performing GROUP BY operations early**: This aligns with the `AGGREGATE_UNION_TRANSPOSE` rule, which involves applying aggregate functions before a UNION ALL operation.

The first strategy involves moving filter conditions from the WHERE clause to the ON clause of INNER JOINs. This adjustment allows the query optimizer to reduce the dataset size before the join operation, potentially leading to more efficient query execution by applying filters earlier in the processing pipeline. The second strategy focuses on rearranging the query to perform GROUP BY operations as early as possible, ideally before executing JOIN operations. This can be achieved by using subqueries for pre-aggregation within each Common Table Expression (CTE) to calculate sales, returns, and profit. By pre-aggregating data in CTEs (`ssr`, `csr`, `wsr`), the dataset size is reduced before subsequent joins and operations, enhancing execution speed and efficiency. Both strategies aim to maintain the logical equivalence of the query while optimizing its execution plan."""\n\n### Suggestion 2:\n"""In Case 3, the SQL query changes involve simplifying the WHERE clause conditions by replacing the explicit range conditions with `SEARCH` using `Sarg`. This transformation optimizes the query by making it easier for the database engine to evaluate the conditions efficiently. The date range condition `d_date between cast(\'1999-09-30\' as date) and cast(\'1999-09-30\' as date) + interval \'30\' day` is simplified to `SEARCH($d_date, Sarg[[1999-09-30..1999-10-30]])`, and the wholesale cost condition `ss_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 74 AND 89` is simplified to `SEARCH($ss_wholesale_cost, Sarg[[74..89]])`. These changes reduce the complexity of the conditions and improve the performance of the query execution."""\n\n### Suggestion 3:\n"""The SQL query uses `LIMIT` in conjunction with `ORDER BY`, and it also involves `GROUP BY`. To optimize this, we can ensure that the database engine efficiently handles sorting and limiting operations. By combining `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY`, the database engine can stop the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained, avoiding full table sorts. Additionally, we can encourage the use of indexed columns with `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT` to make queries more efficient by reducing the cost associated with sorting and filtering operations. This optimization ensures that the database processes only the necessary data for group computations and limits the number of rows retrieved efficiently."""\n\nQuery Rewrite Rule Sets:\n### FILTER Operator Rules: ["FILTER_INTO_JOIN", "FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS"]\n\n### JOIN Operator Rules: ["FILTER_INTO_JOIN"]\n\nQuery Rewrite Rule Explanations:\n### Rule FILTER_INTO_JOIN:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: This SQL query rewrite rule applies when a filter condition is placed on the result set of an INNER JOIN operation. The filter\'s expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there\'s a matching row in the non-preserving side\'s table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned."""\n\n### Rule FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains conditions that can be statically determined as always true (e.g., constant expressions like `1=1` or tautologies based on the column data types and constraints), then these conditions don\'t affect the result set.\n**Transformations**: Remove such conditions from the WHERE clause. If this results in an empty WHERE clause, remove the WHERE clause entirely.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause simplifies to conditions that are always false or involve comparisons with NULL in a way that the outcome is always false or NULL (e.g., `column != column` or `1=0`), indicating no rows can satisfy the filter.\n**Transformations**: Replace the query with one that selects no rows. This could be represented in different ways based on the SQL dialect. One universal method might be selecting from a dual table with a false condition.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains complex conditions that can be simplified based on known constraints, constants, or through logical simplification (e.g., `column IS NOT NULL AND column IS NOT NULL` simplifies to `column IS NOT NULL`).\n**Transformations**: Simplify the conditions according to logical rules and known constraints. Remove redundancy and unnecessary complexity."""'}], 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'stream': False, 'temperature': 0.1}}

For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there\'s a matching row in the non-preserving side\'s table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned."""\n\n### Rule FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains conditions that can be statically determined as always true (e.g., constant expressions like `1=1` or tautologies based on the column data types and constraints), then these conditions don\'t affect the result set.\n**Transformations**: Remove such conditions from the WHERE clause.

The first strategy involves moving filter conditions from the WHERE clause to the ON clause of INNER JOINs. This adjustment allows the query optimizer to reduce the dataset size before the join operation, potentially leading to more efficient query execution by applying filters earlier in the processing pipeline. The second strategy focuses on rearranging the query to perform GROUP BY operations as early as possible, ideally before executing JOIN operations. This can be achieved by using subqueries for pre-aggregation within each Common Table Expression (CTE) to calculate sales, returns, and profit. By pre-aggregating data in CTEs (`ssr`, `csr`, `wsr`), the dataset size is reduced before subsequent joins and operations, enhancing execution speed and efficiency. Both strategies aim to maintain the logical equivalence of the query while optimizing its execution plan."""\n\n### Suggestion 2:\n"""In Case 3, the SQL query changes involve simplifying the WHERE clause conditions by replacing the explicit range conditions with `SEARCH` using `Sarg`. This transformation optimizes the query by making it easier for the database engine to evaluate the conditions efficiently. The date range condition `d_date between cast(\'1999-09-30\' as date) and cast(\'1999-09-30\' as date) + interval \'30\' day` is simplified to `SEARCH($d_date, Sarg[[1999-09-30..1999-10-30]])`, and the wholesale cost condition `ss_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 74 AND 89` is simplified to `SEARCH($ss_wholesale_cost, Sarg[[74..89]])`. These changes reduce the complexity of the conditions and improve the performance of the query execution."""\n\n### Suggestion 3:\n"""The SQL query uses `LIMIT` in conjunction with `ORDER BY`, and it also involves `GROUP BY`. To optimize this, we can ensure that the database engine efficiently handles sorting and limiting operations. By combining `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY`, the database engine can stop the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained, avoiding full table sorts. Additionally, we can encourage the use of indexed columns with `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT` to make queries more efficient by reducing the cost associated with sorting and filtering operations. This optimization ensures that the database processes only the necessary data for group computations and limits the number of rows retrieved efficiently."""\n\nQuery Rewrite Rules:\n### Rule FILTER_INTO_JOIN:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: This SQL query rewrite rule applies when a filter condition is placed on the result set of an INNER JOIN operation. The filter\'s expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join.

The first strategy involves moving filter conditions from the WHERE clause to the ON clause of INNER JOINs. This adjustment allows the query optimizer to reduce the dataset size before the join operation, potentially leading to more efficient query execution by applying filters earlier in the processing pipeline. The second strategy focuses on rearranging the query to perform GROUP BY operations as early as possible, ideally before executing JOIN operations. This can be achieved by using subqueries for pre-aggregation within each Common Table Expression (CTE) to calculate sales, returns, and profit. By pre-aggregating data in CTEs (`ssr`, `csr`, `wsr`), the dataset size is reduced before subsequent joins and operations, enhancing execution speed and efficiency. Both strategies aim to maintain the logical equivalence of the query while optimizing its execution plan."""\n\n### Suggestion 2:\n"""In Case 3, the SQL query changes involve simplifying the WHERE clause conditions by replacing the explicit range conditions with `SEARCH` using `Sarg`. This transformation optimizes the query by making it easier for the database engine to evaluate the conditions efficiently. The date range condition `d_date between cast(\'1999-09-30\' as date) and cast(\'1999-09-30\' as date) + interval \'30\' day` is simplified to `SEARCH($d_date, Sarg[[1999-09-30..1999-10-30]])`, and the wholesale cost condition `ss_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 74 AND 89` is simplified to `SEARCH($ss_wholesale_cost, Sarg[[74..89]])`. These changes reduce the complexity of the conditions and improve the performance of the query execution."""\n\n### Suggestion 3:\n"""The SQL query uses `LIMIT` in conjunction with `ORDER BY`, and it also involves `GROUP BY`. To optimize this, we can ensure that the database engine efficiently handles sorting and limiting operations. By combining `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY`, the database engine can stop the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained, avoiding full table sorts. Additionally, we can encourage the use of indexed columns with `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT` to make queries more efficient by reducing the cost associated with sorting and filtering operations. This optimization ensures that the database processes only the necessary data for group computations and limits the number of rows retrieved efficiently."""\n\nQuery Rewrite Rules:\n### Rule FILTER_INTO_JOIN:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: This SQL query rewrite rule applies when a filter condition is placed on the result set of an INNER JOIN operation. The filter\'s expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there\'s a matching row in the non-preserving side\'s table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned."""\n\n### Rule FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains conditions that can be statically determined as always true (e.g., constant expressions like `1=1` or tautologies based on the column data types and constraints), then these conditions don\'t affect the result set.\n**Transformations**: Remove such conditions from the WHERE clause. If this results in an empty WHERE clause, remove the WHERE clause entirely.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause simplifies to conditions that are always false or involve comparisons with NULL in a way that the outcome is always false or NULL (e.g., `column != column` or `1=0`), indicating no rows can satisfy the filter.\n**Transformations**: Replace the query with one that selects no rows. This could be represented in different ways based on the SQL dialect. One universal method might be selecting from a dual table with a false condition.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains complex conditions that can be simplified based on known constraints, constants, or through logical simplification (e.g., `column IS NOT NULL AND column IS NOT NULL` simplifies to `column IS NOT NULL`).\n**Transformations**: Simplify the conditions according to logical rules and known constraints. Remove redundancy and unnecessary complexity."""\n\nRule Subset Sequences:\n### Rule Sequence 1: ["FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS", "FILTER_INTO_JOIN"]\n\n### Rule Sequence 2: ["FILTER_INTO_JOIN"]'}], 'response': 'To optimize the given SQL query, we need to apply the provided query rewrite rules in a sequence that maximizes efficiency. The suggestions and rules indicate that we should focus on moving filter conditions into join clauses where applicable and simplifying the WHERE clause conditions.\n\nThe suggestions provided can be mapped to the rules as follows:\n- Suggestion 1 aligns with the `FILTER_INTO_JOIN` rule, as it involves moving filter conditions to the ON clause of joins.\n- Suggestion 2 aligns with the `FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS` rule, as it involves simplifying WHERE clause conditions.\n- Suggestion 3 does not directly map to a specific rule but emphasizes efficient handling of `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT`, which is more about query execution strategy rather than rewriting.\n\nGiven the rule subset sequences:\n- Rule Sequence 1: ["FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS", "FILTER_INTO_JOIN"]\n- Rule Sequence 2: ["FILTER_INTO_JOIN"]\n\nWe can deduce that the optimal sequence for applying the rules to the query is to first simplify the WHERE clause conditions using `FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS`, and then move applicable filter conditions into the join clauses using `FILTER_INTO_JOIN`. This sequence ensures that the query is simplified before moving conditions into joins, which can lead to more efficient execution.\n\nTherefore, the overall sequence for applying the rules is:\n1. `FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS`\n2. `FILTER_INTO_JOIN`\n\n```python\n["FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS", "FILTER_INTO_JOIN"]\n```', 'time': 4.334825754165649}

The first strategy involves moving filter conditions from the WHERE clause to the ON clause of INNER JOINs. This adjustment allows the query optimizer to reduce the dataset size before the join operation, potentially leading to more efficient query execution by applying filters earlier in the processing pipeline. The second strategy focuses on rearranging the query to perform GROUP BY operations as early as possible, ideally before executing JOIN operations. This can be achieved by using subqueries for pre-aggregation within each Common Table Expression (CTE) to calculate sales, returns, and profit. By pre-aggregating data in CTEs (`ssr`, `csr`, `wsr`), the dataset size is reduced before subsequent joins and operations, enhancing execution speed and efficiency. Both strategies aim to maintain the logical equivalence of the query while optimizing its execution plan."""\n\n### Suggestion 2:\n"""In Case 3, the SQL query changes involve simplifying the WHERE clause conditions by replacing the explicit range conditions with `SEARCH` using `Sarg`. This transformation optimizes the query by making it easier for the database engine to evaluate the conditions efficiently. The date range condition `d_date between cast(\'1999-09-30\' as date) and cast(\'1999-09-30\' as date) + interval \'30\' day` is simplified to `SEARCH($d_date, Sarg[[1999-09-30..1999-10-30]])`, and the wholesale cost condition `ss_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 74 AND 89` is simplified to `SEARCH($ss_wholesale_cost, Sarg[[74..89]])`. These changes reduce the complexity of the conditions and improve the performance of the query execution."""\n\n### Suggestion 3:\n"""The SQL query uses `LIMIT` in conjunction with `ORDER BY`, and it also involves `GROUP BY`. To optimize this, we can ensure that the database engine efficiently handles sorting and limiting operations. By combining `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY`, the database engine can stop the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained, avoiding full table sorts. Additionally, we can encourage the use of indexed columns with `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT` to make queries more efficient by reducing the cost associated with sorting and filtering operations. This optimization ensures that the database processes only the necessary data for group computations and limits the number of rows retrieved efficiently."""\n\nQuery Rewrite Rules:\n### Rule FILTER_INTO_JOIN:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: This SQL query rewrite rule applies when a filter condition is placed on the result set of an INNER JOIN operation. The filter\'s expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there\'s a matching row in the non-preserving side\'s table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned."""\n\n### Rule FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains conditions that can be statically determined as always true (e.g., constant expressions like `1=1` or tautologies based on the column data types and constraints), then these conditions don\'t affect the result set.\n**Transformations**: Remove such conditions from the WHERE clause. If this results in an empty WHERE clause, remove the WHERE clause entirely.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause simplifies to conditions that are always false or involve comparisons with NULL in a way that the outcome is always false or NULL (e.g., `column != column` or `1=0`), indicating no rows can satisfy the filter.\n**Transformations**: Replace the query with one that selects no rows. This could be represented in different ways based on the SQL dialect. One universal method might be selecting from a dual table with a false condition.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains complex conditions that can be simplified based on known constraints, constants, or through logical simplification (e.g., `column IS NOT NULL AND column IS NOT NULL` simplifies to `column IS NOT NULL`).\n**Transformations**: Simplify the conditions according to logical rules and known constraints. Remove redundancy and unnecessary complexity."""\n\nArranged Rule Sequence: ["FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS", "FILTER_INTO_JOIN"]\n\nUtilized Rules: ["FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS", "FILTER_INTO_JOIN"]\n\nUnutilized Rules: []'}], 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'stream': False, 'temperature': 0.1}}

The first strategy involves moving filter conditions from the WHERE clause to the ON clause of INNER JOINs. This adjustment allows the query optimizer to reduce the dataset size before the join operation, potentially leading to more efficient query execution by applying filters earlier in the processing pipeline. The second strategy focuses on rearranging the query to perform GROUP BY operations as early as possible, ideally before executing JOIN operations. This can be achieved by using subqueries for pre-aggregation within each Common Table Expression (CTE) to calculate sales, returns, and profit. By pre-aggregating data in CTEs (`ssr`, `csr`, `wsr`), the dataset size is reduced before subsequent joins and operations, enhancing execution speed and efficiency. Both strategies aim to maintain the logical equivalence of the query while optimizing its execution plan."""\n\n### Suggestion 2:\n"""In Case 3, the SQL query changes involve simplifying the WHERE clause conditions by replacing the explicit range conditions with `SEARCH` using `Sarg`. This transformation optimizes the query by making it easier for the database engine to evaluate the conditions efficiently. The date range condition `d_date between cast(\'1999-09-30\' as date) and cast(\'1999-09-30\' as date) + interval \'30\' day` is simplified to `SEARCH($d_date, Sarg[[1999-09-30..1999-10-30]])`, and the wholesale cost condition `ss_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 74 AND 89` is simplified to `SEARCH($ss_wholesale_cost, Sarg[[74..89]])`. These changes reduce the complexity of the conditions and improve the performance of the query execution."""\n\n### Suggestion 3:\n"""The SQL query uses `LIMIT` in conjunction with `ORDER BY`, and it also involves `GROUP BY`. To optimize this, we can ensure that the database engine efficiently handles sorting and limiting operations. By combining `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY`, the database engine can stop the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained, avoiding full table sorts. Additionally, we can encourage the use of indexed columns with `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT` to make queries more efficient by reducing the cost associated with sorting and filtering operations. This optimization ensures that the database processes only the necessary data for group computations and limits the number of rows retrieved efficiently."""\n\nQuery Rewrite Rules:\n### Rule FILTER_INTO_JOIN:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: This SQL query rewrite rule applies when a filter condition is placed on the result set of an INNER JOIN operation. The filter\'s expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there\'s a matching row in the non-preserving side\'s table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned."""\n\n### Rule FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains conditions that can be statically determined as always true (e.g., constant expressions like `1=1` or tautologies based on the column data types and constraints), then these conditions don\'t affect the result set.\n**Transformations**: Remove such conditions from the WHERE clause. If this results in an empty WHERE clause, remove the WHERE clause entirely.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause simplifies to conditions that are always false or involve comparisons with NULL in a way that the outcome is always false or NULL (e.g., `column != column` or `1=0`), indicating no rows can satisfy the filter.\n**Transformations**: Replace the query with one that selects no rows. This could be represented in different ways based on the SQL dialect. One universal method might be selecting from a dual table with a false condition.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains complex conditions that can be simplified based on known constraints, constants, or through logical simplification (e.g., `column IS NOT NULL AND column IS NOT NULL` simplifies to `column IS NOT NULL`).\n**Transformations**: Simplify the conditions according to logical rules and known constraints. Remove redundancy and unnecessary complexity."""\n\nArranged Rule Sequence: ["FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS", "FILTER_INTO_JOIN"]\n\nUtilized Rules: ["FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS", "FILTER_INTO_JOIN"]\n\nUnutilized Rules: []'}], 'response': 'Step 1: Since there are no unutilized rules in the provided arrangement, we cannot prioritize any unutilized potential rules over the utilized ones.
