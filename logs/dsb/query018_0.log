When the `LIMIT` clause is used to fetch a specified number of rows.\n2. When `ORDER BY` is used in conjunction with `LIMIT` to sort and limit the number of rows retrieved, particularly when sorting can leverage an index.\n3. When `DISTINCT` is used along with `LIMIT` to quickly identify and return unique rows without scanning the full dataset.\n4. During the use of `GROUP BY`, where optimization might involve sorting or traversing indexes in order to efficiently compute group values without processing the entire dataset.\n5. When sorting a specific number of rows from a single table based on non-indexed columns, utilizing in-memory sorting (`filesort`) techniques.\n**Transformations**: The specific SQL transformations that emerge from applying these optimization rules are:\n1. Combining `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY` encourages the database engine to stop the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained, avoiding full table sorts.\n2. Using `LIMIT` with `DISTINCT` leads to an early termination of the search for unique rows as soon as the needed amount is gathered, reducing time and resources spent on scanning the entire dataset.\n3. In the context of `GROUP BY`, optimizations may include indexing strategies or modifications to the way sorting is handled, such as employing `filesort` mechanisms that do not require temporary tables, ensuring that the database engine processes only the necessary data for group computations.\n4. Efficiencies are gained by encouraging the use of indexed columns with `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT`, making queries more efficient by reducing the cost associated with sorting and filtering operations.\n"""\nRule 4:\n"""\n**Conditions**: The SQL query rewrite rule applies when there are:\n- Functions or operations (especially deterministic ones) within the SELECT, WHERE, JOIN conditions, or any part of the query that is executed multiple times for the same row.\n- The presence of potentially computationally expensive operations or function calls that are not dependent on the data of the specific row and thus can be optimized.\n**Transformations**: 1. Move repeated function calls or operations outside of loops, if applicable. For example, if a function that generates a calculated value based on constants or parameters (not row-specific data) is being called in a loop, calculate the value once before the loop and store the result for reuse.\n   \n2. Replace inline functions in the SELECT or WHERE clause with a pre-calculated column if the function is deterministic and the input data does not change frequently. This might involve:\n   - Creating a temporary table that includes the results of the expensive function calls.\n   - Using a subquery or a Common Table Expression (CTE) that calculates the value once and then joins it with the main query.\n   \n3. When using aggregate functions that are called multiple times with the same parameters, consider storing the result in a variable or a temporary table, especially if the data set is large.\n\n4. Avoid using functions on indexed columns in the WHERE clause. This prevents the database from using the index efficiently. If a function must be used, consider creating a computed column that pre-calculates the function\'s result and index that column instead.\n\n5. If possible, simplify expressions and calculations to reduce their complexity and execution time. This might involve algebraic simplification or breaking down complex calculations into simpler parts that can be calculated separately and then combined.\n\nExample:\nOriginal Query:\n```sql\nSELECT id, name, expensive_function(column) as expensive_result\nFROM table\nWHERE expensive_function(column) > 100;\n```\n\nTransformed Query using a CTE:\n```sql\nWITH PreCalculated AS (\n  SELECT id, name, column, expensive_function(column) as expensive_result\n  FROM table\n)\nSELECT id, name, expensive_sel as expensive_result\nFROM PreCalculated\nWHERE expensive_result > 100;\n```\n"""'}], 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'stream': False, 'temperature': 0.1}}

The filter's expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there's a matching row in the non-preserving side's table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned.\n```\n\nLogical Plan Changes After Rewrite: ```\n  LogicalSort(sort0=[$1(ca_country)], sort1=[$2(ca_state)], sort2=[$3(ca_county)], sort3=[$0(i_item_id)], dir0=[ASC], dir1=[ASC], dir2=[ASC], dir3=[ASC], fetch=[100])\r\n    LogicalAggregate(group=[{0, 1, 2, 3}], groups=[[{0, 1, 2, 3}, {0, 1, 2}, {0, 1}, {0}, {}]], agg1=[AVG($4)], agg2=[AVG($5)], agg3=[AVG($6)], agg4=[AVG($7)], agg5=[AVG($8)], agg6=[AVG($9)])\r\n      LogicalProject(i_item_id=[$103(i_item_id)], ca_country=[$71(ca_country)], ca_state=[$69(ca_state)], ca_county=[$68(ca_county)], $f4=[CAST($18(cs_quantity)):DECIMAL(12, 2)], $f5=[CAST($20(cs_list_price)):DECIMAL(12, 2)], $f6=[CAST($27(cs_coupon_amt)):DECIMAL(12, 2)], $f7=[CAST($21(cs_sales_price)):DECIMAL(12, 2)], $f8=[CAST($33(cs_net_profit)):DECIMAL(12, 2)], $f9=[CAST($56(c_birth_year)):DECIMAL(12, 2)])\r\n-       LogicalFilter(condition=[AND(=($0(cs_sold_date_sk), $74(d_date_sk)), =($15(cs_item_sk), $102(i_item_sk)), =($4(cs_bill_cdemo_sk), $34(cd_demo_sk)), =($3(cs_bill_customer_sk), $43(c_customer_sk)), =(CAST($35(cd_gender)):CHAR(1), 'F'), =(CAST($37(cd_education_status)):CHAR(11), '2 yr Degree'), =($47(c_current_addr_sk), $61(ca_address_sk)), =($80(d_year), 2000), =($55(c_birth_month), 3), OR(=(CAST($69(ca_state)):CHAR(2), 'GA'), =(CAST($69(ca_state)):CHAR(2), 'ME'), =(CAST($69(ca_state)):CHAR(2), 'NC')), >=($19(cs_wholesale_cost), 84), <=($19(cs_wholesale_cost), 89), =(CAST($114(i_category)):CHAR(5), 'Books'))])\r\n-         LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n-           LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n-             LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n-               LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n-                 LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n+       LogicalJoin(condition=[=($15(cs_item_sk), $102(i_item_sk))], joinType=[inner])\r\n+         LogicalJoin(condition=[=($0(cs_sold_date_sk), $74(d_date_sk))], joinType=[inner])\r\n+           LogicalJoin(condition=[=($47(c_current_addr_sk), $61(ca_address_sk))], joinType=[inner])\r\n+             LogicalJoin(condition=[=($3(cs_bill_customer_sk), $43(c_customer_sk))], joinType=[inner])\r\n+               LogicalJoin(condition=[=($4(cs_bill_cdemo_sk), $34(cd_demo_sk))], joinType=[inner])\r\n+                 LogicalFilter(condition=[SEARCH($19(cs_wholesale_cost), Sarg[[84..89]])])\r\n                    LogicalTableScan(table=[[catalog_sales]])\r\n+                 LogicalFilter(condition=[AND(=(CAST($1(cd_gender)):CHAR(1), 'F'), =(CAST($3(cd_education_status)):CHAR(11), '2 yr Degree'))])\r\n                    LogicalTableScan(table=[[customer_demographics]])\r\n+               LogicalFilter(condition=[=($12(c_birth_month), 3)])\r\n                  LogicalTableScan(table=[[customer]])\r\n+             LogicalFilter(condition=[SEARCH(CAST($8(ca_state)):CHAR(2), Sarg['GA', 'ME', 'NC']:CHAR(2))])\r\n                LogicalTableScan(table=[[customer_address]])\r\n+           LogicalFilter(condition=[=($6(d_year), 2000)])\r\n              LogicalTableScan(table=[[date_dim]])\r\n+         LogicalFilter(condition=[=(CAST($12(i_category)):CHAR(5), 'Books')])\r\n            LogicalTableScan(table=[[item]])\r\n  \n```"}], 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'stream': False, 'temperature': 0.1}}

Replace inline functions in the SELECT or WHERE clause with a pre-calculated column if the function is deterministic and the input data does not change frequently. This might involve:\n   - Creating a temporary table that includes the results of the expensive function calls.\n   - Using a subquery or a Common Table Expression (CTE) that calculates the value once and then joins it with the main query.\n   \n3. When using aggregate functions that are called multiple times with the same parameters, consider storing the result in a variable or a temporary table, especially if the data set is large.\n\n4. Avoid using functions on indexed columns in the WHERE clause. This prevents the database from using the index efficiently. If a function must be used, consider creating a computed column that pre-calculates the function\'s result and index that column instead.\n\n5. If possible, simplify expressions and calculations to reduce their complexity and execution time. This might involve algebraic simplification or breaking down complex calculations into simpler parts that can be calculated separately and then combined.\n\nExample:\nOriginal Query:\n```sql\nSELECT id, name, expensive_function(column) as expensive_result\nFROM table\nWHERE expensive_function(column) > 100;\n```\n\nTransformed Query using a CTE:\n```sql\nWITH PreCalculated AS (\n  SELECT id, name, column, expensive_function(column) as expensive_result\n  FROM table\n)\nSELECT id, name, expensive_sel as expensive_result\nFROM PreCalculated\nWHERE expensive_result > 100;\n```\n"""'}], 'response': 'Step 1: Analyze the SQL query against each rule\'s conditions to determine applicability.\n\n- **Rule 1**: The query does not use NOT EXISTS, NOT IN, EXISTS, IN, or OR within JOINs and WHERE clauses.

The original filter condition included a series of `AND` conditions with specific checks on columns like `cs_sold_date_sk`, `cs_item_sk`, `cs_bill_cdemo_sk`, `cs_bill_customer_sk`, `cd_gender`, `cd_education_status`, `c_current_addr_sk`, `d_year`, `c_birth_month`, `ca_state`, `cs_wholesale_cost`, and `i_category`. The changes involve the transformation of the `ca_state` and `cs_wholesale_cost` conditions into `SEARCH` predicates, which are more efficient representations for range and set membership checks.\n\nStep 2: Parsing the logical plan changes, we see that the original `ca_state in ('GA', 'ME', 'NC')` condition is transformed into `SEARCH(CAST($69(ca_state)):CHAR(2), Sarg['GA', 'ME', 'NC']:CHAR(2))`, and the `cs_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 84 AND 89` condition is transformed into `SEARCH($19(cs_wholesale_cost), Sarg[[84..89]])`. These transformations indicate a simplification and optimization of the conditions using `SEARCH` predicates, which are likely more efficient for query execution.\n\nStep 3: The query rewrite rule contains three cases. Case 1 deals with removing always true conditions, Case 2 with always false conditions, and Case 3 with simplifying complex conditions. The changes observed in the logical plan align with Case 3, where complex conditions are simplified based on known constraints or logical simplifications. The transformation of `IN` and `BETWEEN` conditions into `SEARCH` predicates fits the description of simplifying conditions for efficiency.\n\nStep 4: The SQL query changes involve the optimization of the `WHERE` clause conditions. Specifically, the `ca_state in ('GA', 'ME', 'NC')` condition is simplified to a `SEARCH` predicate, which efficiently checks for membership in a set. Similarly, the `cs_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 84 AND 89` condition is simplified to a `SEARCH` predicate that efficiently checks for a range. These changes are consistent with Case 3 of the query rewrite rule, where complex conditions are simplified for better performance. The use of `SEARCH` predicates likely allows the query engine to utilize indexes or other optimizations, improving the execution efficiency of the query.", 'time': 6.136974811553955}

The filter's expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there's a matching row in the non-preserving side's table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned.\n```\n\nLogical Plan Changes After Rewrite: ```\n  LogicalSort(sort0=[$1(ca_country)], sort1=[$2(ca_state)], sort2=[$3(ca_county)], sort3=[$0(i_item_id)], dir0=[ASC], dir1=[ASC], dir2=[ASC], dir3=[ASC], fetch=[100])\r\n    LogicalAggregate(group=[{0, 1, 2, 3}], groups=[[{0, 1, 2, 3}, {0, 1, 2}, {0, 1}, {0}, {}]], agg1=[AVG($4)], agg2=[AVG($5)], agg3=[AVG($6)], agg4=[AVG($7)], agg5=[AVG($8)], agg6=[AVG($9)])\r\n      LogicalProject(i_item_id=[$103(i_item_id)], ca_country=[$71(ca_country)], ca_state=[$69(ca_state)], ca_county=[$68(ca_county)], $f4=[CAST($18(cs_quantity)):DECIMAL(12, 2)], $f5=[CAST($20(cs_list_price)):DECIMAL(12, 2)], $f6=[CAST($27(cs_coupon_amt)):DECIMAL(12, 2)], $f7=[CAST($21(cs_sales_price)):DECIMAL(12, 2)], $f8=[CAST($33(cs_net_profit)):DECIMAL(12, 2)], $f9=[CAST($56(c_birth_year)):DECIMAL(12, 2)])\r\n-       LogicalFilter(condition=[AND(=($0(cs_sold_date_sk), $74(d_date_sk)), =($15(cs_item_sk), $102(i_item_sk)), =($4(cs_bill_cdemo_sk), $34(cd_demo_sk)), =($3(cs_bill_customer_sk), $43(c_customer_sk)), =(CAST($35(cd_gender)):CHAR(1), 'F'), =(CAST($37(cd_education_status)):CHAR(11), '2 yr Degree'), =($47(c_current_addr_sk), $61(ca_address_sk)), =($80(d_year), 2000), =($55(c_birth_month), 3), OR(=(CAST($69(ca_state)):CHAR(2), 'GA'), =(CAST($69(ca_state)):CHAR(2), 'ME'), =(CAST($69(ca_state)):CHAR(2), 'NC')), >=($19(cs_wholesale_cost), 84), <=($19(cs_wholesale_cost), 89), =(CAST($114(i_category)):CHAR(5), 'Books'))])\r\n-         LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n-           LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n-             LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n-               LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n-                 LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n+       LogicalJoin(condition=[=($15(cs_item_sk), $102(i_item_sk))], joinType=[inner])\r\n+         LogicalJoin(condition=[=($0(cs_sold_date_sk), $74(d_date_sk))], joinType=[inner])\r\n+           LogicalJoin(condition=[=($47(c_current_addr_sk), $61(ca_address_sk))], joinType=[inner])\r\n+             LogicalJoin(condition=[=($3(cs_bill_customer_sk), $43(c_customer_sk))], joinType=[inner])\r\n+               LogicalJoin(condition=[=($4(cs_bill_cdemo_sk), $34(cd_demo_sk))], joinType=[inner])\r\n+                 LogicalFilter(condition=[SEARCH($19(cs_wholesale_cost), Sarg[[84..89]])])\r\n                    LogicalTableScan(table=[[catalog_sales]])\r\n+                 LogicalFilter(condition=[AND(=(CAST($1(cd_gender)):CHAR(1), 'F'), =(CAST($3(cd_education_status)):CHAR(11), '2 yr Degree'))])\r\n                    LogicalTableScan(table=[[customer_demographics]])\r\n+               LogicalFilter(condition=[=($12(c_birth_month), 3)])\r\n                  LogicalTableScan(table=[[customer]])\r\n+             LogicalFilter(condition=[SEARCH(CAST($8(ca_state)):CHAR(2), Sarg['GA', 'ME', 'NC']:CHAR(2))])\r\n                LogicalTableScan(table=[[customer_address]])\r\n+           LogicalFilter(condition=[=($6(d_year), 2000)])\r\n              LogicalTableScan(table=[[date_dim]])\r\n+         LogicalFilter(condition=[=(CAST($12(i_category)):CHAR(5), 'Books')])\r\n            LogicalTableScan(table=[[item]])\r\n  \n```"}], 'response': "Step 1: The logical plan changes indicate that several filter conditions have been moved from a single `LogicalFilter` node that applied to the result of a series of `LogicalJoin` operations to individual `LogicalFilter` nodes that apply directly to the respective tables before the join operations. This transformation suggests that the query rewrite rule has been applied to push down filter conditions closer to the data source tables.\n\nStep 2: Parsing the logical plan changes, we observe the following detailed changes in the SQL query:\n- The condition `cs_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 84 AND 89` has been moved to a `LogicalFilter` directly on the `catalog_sales` table.\n- The conditions `cd_gender = 'F'` and `cd_education_status = '2 yr Degree'` have been moved to a `LogicalFilter` directly on the `customer_demographics` table.\n- The condition `c_birth_month = 3` has been moved to a `LogicalFilter` directly on the `customer` table.\n- The condition `ca_state in ('GA', 'ME', 'NC')` has been moved to a `LogicalFilter` directly on the `customer_address` table.\n- The condition `d_year = 2000` has been moved to a `LogicalFilter` directly on the `date_dim` table.\n- The condition `i_category = 'Books'` has been moved to a `LogicalFilter` directly on the `item` table.\n\nStep 3: The query rewrite rule contains multiple cases. The parsed SQL query changes match Case 1 of the query rewrite rule. This is because the original query had filter conditions in the `WHERE` clause that could be logically associated with columns from individual tables involved in the `INNER JOIN` operations. These conditions were moved to `LogicalFilter` nodes directly on the respective tables, which aligns with the transformation described in Case 1.\n\nStep 4: In Case 1, the rule applies when a filter condition is placed on the result set of an `INNER JOIN` operation, and the filter's expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join. The transformation involves moving these conditions into the `ON` clause of the `INNER JOIN` or as a `WHERE` clause on a subquery of the respective side. In this query, conditions such as `cs_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 84 AND 89`, `cd_gender = 'F'`, `cd_education_status = '2 yr Degree'`, `c_birth_month = 3`, `ca_state in ('GA', 'ME', 'NC')`, `d_year = 2000`, and `i_category = 'Books'` were moved to `LogicalFilter` nodes directly on their respective tables (`catalog_sales`, `customer_demographics`, `customer`, `customer_address`, `date_dim`, and `item`).

Query 1: In Case 1, the rule applies when a filter condition is placed on the result set of an `INNER JOIN` operation, and the filter's expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join.

In this query, conditions such as `cs_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 84 AND 89`, `cd_gender = 'F'`, `cd_education_status = '2 yr Degree'`, `c_birth_month = 3`, `ca_state in ('GA', 'ME', 'NC')`, `d_year = 2000`, and `i_category = 'Books'` were moved to `LogicalFilter` nodes directly on their respective tables (`catalog_sales`, `customer_demographics`, `customer`, `customer_address`, `date_dim`, and `item`). This pushdown of filters reduces the size of datasets before the join occurs, optimizing the query execution by filtering data earlier in the process.
Query 2: The SQL query changes involve the optimization of the `WHERE` clause conditions. Specifically, the `ca_state in ('GA', 'ME', 'NC')` condition is simplified to a `SEARCH` predicate, which efficiently checks for membership in a set. Similarly, the `cs_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 84 AND 89` condition is simplified to a `SEARCH` predicate that efficiently checks for a range. These changes are consistent with Case 3 of the query rewrite rule, where complex conditions are simplified for better performance. The use of `SEARCH` predicates likely allows the query engine to utilize indexes or other optimizations, improving the execution efficiency of the query.
Query 3: The SQL query performs a `GROUP BY` operation along with `JOIN` operations. According to Rule 2, we can enhance performance by rearranging the query to perform `GROUP BY` operations at the earliest stage. This can be achieved by using subqueries for pre-aggregation to reduce the dataset size early in the execution process. 

For example, we could create a subquery that pre-aggregates the necessary columns from `catalog_sales` before joining with other tables. This would reduce the amount of data processed in subsequent joins, potentially improving query performance. However, the specific transformation would depend on the database's execution plan and the size of the datasets involved.
Query 4: The SQL query uses `LIMIT` in conjunction with `ORDER BY`, and it also involves `GROUP BY`. According to Rule 3, combining `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY` encourages the database engine to stop the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained, avoiding full table sorts. Additionally, optimizations may include indexing strategies or modifications to the way sorting is handled, such as employing `filesort` mechanisms that do not require temporary tables. 

To apply this transformation, ensure that the columns used in the `ORDER BY` clause (`ca_country`, `ca_state`, `ca_county`, `i_item_id`) are indexed, which can help the database engine efficiently sort and limit the number of rows retrieved.
Query 5: The SQL query involves multiple `CAST` operations within the `SELECT` clause, which are deterministic functions. According to Rule 4, these operations can be optimized by moving repeated function calls outside of loops or by using pre-calculated columns. 

For instance, if the `CAST` operations are computationally expensive and the input data does not change frequently, consider creating a temporary table or a Common Table Expression (CTE) that includes the results of these `CAST` operations. This would allow the query to reuse the pre-calculated values, reducing the computational overhead during query execution.

"""In Case 1, the rule applies when a filter condition is placed on the result set of an `INNER JOIN` operation, and the filter's expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join. The transformation involves moving these conditions into the `ON` clause of the `INNER JOIN` or as a `WHERE` clause on a subquery of the respective side. In this query, conditions such as `cs_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 84 AND 89`, `cd_gender = 'F'`, `cd_education_status = '2 yr Degree'`, `c_birth_month = 3`, `ca_state in ('GA', 'ME', 'NC')`, `d_year = 2000`, and `i_category = 'Books'` were moved to `LogicalFilter` nodes directly on their respective tables (`catalog_sales`, `customer_demographics`, `customer`, `customer_address`, `date_dim`, and `item`). This pushdown of filters reduces the size of datasets before the join occurs, optimizing the query execution by filtering data earlier in the process."""

Similarly, the `cs_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 84 AND 89` condition is simplified to a `SEARCH` predicate that efficiently checks for a range. These changes are consistent with Case 3 of the query rewrite rule, where complex conditions are simplified for better performance. The use of `SEARCH` predicates likely allows the query engine to utilize indexes or other optimizations, improving the execution efficiency of the query."""

Query Rewrite 3:
"""The SQL query performs a `GROUP BY` operation along with `JOIN` operations. According to Rule 2, we can enhance performance by rearranging the query to perform `GROUP BY` operations at the earliest stage. This can be achieved by using subqueries for pre-aggregation to reduce the dataset size early in the execution process. 

For example, we could create a subquery that pre-aggregates the necessary columns from `catalog_sales` before joining with other tables. This would reduce the amount of data processed in subsequent joins, potentially improving query performance. However, the specific transformation would depend on the database's execution plan and the size of the datasets involved."""

According to Rule 3, combining `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY` encourages the database engine to stop the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained, avoiding full table sorts. Additionally, optimizations may include indexing strategies or modifications to the way sorting is handled, such as employing `filesort` mechanisms that do not require temporary tables. 

To apply this transformation, ensure that the columns used in the `ORDER BY` clause (`ca_country`, `ca_state`, `ca_county`, `i_item_id`) are indexed, which can help the database engine efficiently sort and limit the number of rows retrieved."""

Query Rewrite 5:
"""The SQL query involves multiple `CAST` operations within the `SELECT` clause, which are deterministic functions. According to Rule 4, these operations can be optimized by moving repeated function calls outside of loops or by using pre-calculated columns. 

For instance, if the `CAST` operations are computationally expensive and the input data does not change frequently, consider creating a temporary table or a Common Table Expression (CTE) that includes the results of these `CAST` operations.

05:19:50,233 root WARNING Failed to cluster rewrite strategies: To cluster the provided query rewrite strategies, we need to identify common themes or techniques among them. Here's a breakdown of the strategies:

1. **Query Rewrite 1** focuses on filter pushdown, moving conditions closer to the data source to reduce the dataset size before joins.
2. **Query Rewrite 2** involves simplifying `WHERE` clause conditions using `SEARCH` predicates for efficient membership and range checks.
3. **Query Rewrite 3** suggests rearranging the query to perform `GROUP BY` operations earlier using subqueries for pre-aggregation.
4. **Query Rewrite 4** discusses optimizing `LIMIT` and `ORDER BY` operations, potentially using indexing strategies.
5. **Query Rewrite 5** addresses optimizing repeated `CAST` operations by pre-calculating values or using CTEs.

Based on these descriptions, we can cluster the strategies as follows:

- **Cluster 1: Filter and Condition Optimization**
  - Query Rewrite 1: Filter pushdown to optimize joins.
  - Query Rewrite 2: Simplification of `WHERE` conditions using `SEARCH` predicates.

- **Cluster 2: Aggregation and Pre-Processing Optimization**
  - Query Rewrite 3: Pre-aggregation using subqueries to optimize `GROUP BY`.

- **Cluster 3: Sorting and Limiting Optimization**
  - Query Rewrite 4: Optimizing `LIMIT` and `ORDER BY` with indexing.

- **Cluster 4: Function and Calculation Optimization**
  - Query Rewrite 5: Optimizing `CAST` operations by pre-calculation.

Here is the clustering in Python list format:

```python
[
    [0, 1],  # Cluster 1: Filter and Condition Optimization
    [2],     # Cluster 2: Aggregation and Pre-Processing Optimization
    [3],     # Cluster 3: Sorting and Limiting Optimization
    [4]      # Cluster 4: Function and Calculation Optimization

This pushdown of filters reduces the size of datasets before the join occurs, optimizing the query execution by filtering data earlier in the process."""\n\nQuery Rewrite 2:\n"""The SQL query changes involve the optimization of the `WHERE` clause conditions. Specifically, the `ca_state in (\'GA\', \'ME\', \'NC\')` condition is simplified to a `SEARCH` predicate, which efficiently checks for membership in a set. Similarly, the `cs_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 84 AND 89` condition is simplified to a `SEARCH` predicate that efficiently checks for a range. These changes are consistent with Case 3 of the query rewrite rule, where complex conditions are simplified for better performance. The use of `SEARCH` predicates likely allows the query engine to utilize indexes or other optimizations, improving the execution efficiency of the query."""\n\nQuery Rewrite 3:\n"""The SQL query performs a `GROUP BY` operation along with `JOIN` operations. According to Rule 2, we can enhance performance by rearranging the query to perform `GROUP BY` operations at the earliest stage. This can be achieved by using subqueries for pre-aggregation to reduce the dataset size early in the execution process. \n\nFor example, we could create a subquery that pre-aggregates the necessary columns from `catalog_sales` before joining with other tables. This would reduce the amount of data processed in subsequent joins, potentially improving query performance. However, the specific transformation would depend on the database\'s execution plan and the size of the datasets involved."""\n\nQuery Rewrite 4:\n"""The SQL query uses `LIMIT` in conjunction with `ORDER BY`, and it also involves `GROUP BY`. According to Rule 3, combining `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY` encourages the database engine to stop the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained, avoiding full table sorts. Additionally, optimizations may include indexing strategies or modifications to the way sorting is handled, such as employing `filesort` mechanisms that do not require temporary tables. \n\nTo apply this transformation, ensure that the columns used in the `ORDER BY` clause (`ca_country`, `ca_state`, `ca_county`, `i_item_id`) are indexed, which can help the database engine efficiently sort and limit the number of rows retrieved."""\n\nQuery Rewrite 5:\n"""The SQL query involves multiple `CAST` operations within the `SELECT` clause, which are deterministic functions. According to Rule 4, these operations can be optimized by moving repeated function calls outside of loops or by using pre-calculated columns. \n\nFor instance, if the `CAST` operations are computationally expensive and the input data does not change frequently, consider creating a temporary table or a Common Table Expression (CTE) that includes the results of these `CAST` operations. This would allow the query to reuse the pre-calculated values, reducing the computational overhead during query execution."""'}], 'response': "The provided SQL query can be optimized using several strategies.

Firstly, filter conditions that do not reference columns from both tables in an `INNER JOIN` can be moved to the `ON` clause or applied directly to the respective tables as `LogicalFilter` nodes, reducing dataset size before joins and improving execution efficiency. Secondly, complex `WHERE` clause conditions, such as `ca_state in (\'GA\', \'ME\', \'NC\')` and `cs_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 84 AND 89`, can be simplified using `SEARCH` predicates, allowing the query engine to leverage indexes for better performance. Thirdly, performing `GROUP BY` operations early through subqueries can reduce data size before joins, enhancing performance. Additionally, combining `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY` can optimize sorting by stopping once the required number of rows is obtained, especially if the columns in the `ORDER BY` clause are indexed. Lastly, repeated `CAST` operations in the `SELECT` clause can be optimized by pre-calculating these values using temporary tables or Common Table Expressions (CTEs), minimizing computational overhead during execution."""\n\nQuery Rewrite Rules:\n### Rule FILTER_INTO_JOIN:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: This SQL query rewrite rule applies when a filter condition is placed on the result set of an INNER JOIN operation. The filter\'s expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there\'s a matching row in the non-preserving side\'s table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned."""\n\n### Rule FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains conditions that can be statically determined as always true (e.g., constant expressions like `1=1` or tautologies based on the column data types and constraints), then these conditions don\'t affect the result set.\n**Transformations**: Remove such conditions from the WHERE clause. If this results in an empty WHERE clause, remove the WHERE clause entirely.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause simplifies to conditions that are always false or involve comparisons with NULL in a way that the outcome is always false or NULL (e.g., `column != column` or `1=0`), indicating no rows can satisfy the filter.\n**Transformations**: Replace the query with one that selects no rows. This could be represented in different ways based on the SQL dialect. One universal method might be selecting from a dual table with a false condition.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains complex conditions that can be simplified based on known constraints, constants, or through logical simplification (e.g., `column IS NOT NULL AND column IS NOT NULL` simplifies to `column IS NOT NULL`).\n**Transformations**: Simplify the conditions according to logical rules and known constraints. Remove redundancy and unnecessary complexity."""\n\n### Rule PROJECT_FILTER_TRANSPOSE:\n"""**Conditions**: This rewrite rule can be applied when an SQL query contains a SELECT operation (acting as the `Project` operation) followed by a WHERE clause (acting as the `Filter` operation), provided that the SELECT does not contain window functions (such as RANK(), ROW_NUMBER(), etc.) and the columns selected do not affect the outcome of the WHERE clause.\n**Transformations**: To apply the rule, refactor the SQL query so that the conditions in the WHERE clause are evaluated before the columns are selected in the SELECT clause. This may involve moving computations or column transformations from the SELECT clause to a sub-query that the WHERE clause is applied on, ensuring the final SELECT clause on the outermost query matches the original query\'s expected outcome. - Before: SELECT col1, transformation_function(col2) FROM table WHERE condition; - After: SELECT col1, transformation_function(col2) FROM (SELECT col1, col2 FROM table WHERE condition) AS subquery;"""\n\n### Rule AGGREGATE_REDUCE_FUNCTIONS:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: any SELECT statement or subquery using the AVG aggregate function\n**Transformations**: AVG(x) as SUM(x) / COUNT(x)\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: computing the population standard deviation\n**Transformations**: STDDEV_POP(x) as the square root of (`SUM(x^2) - SUM(x)^2 / COUNT(x)`) / COUNT(x)\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: for the sample standard deviation computation\n**Transformations**: STDDEV_SAMP(x) as the square root of (`SUM(x^2) - SUM(x)^2 / COUNT(x)`) / (COUNT(x) - 1)\nCase 4:\n**Conditions**: for the population variance computation\n**Transformations**: VAR_POP(x) as (`SUM(x^2) - SUM(x)^2 / COUNT(x)`) / COUNT(x)\nCase 5:\n**Conditions**: for the sample variance computation\n**Transformations**: VAR_SAMP(x) as (`SUM(x^2) - SUM(x)^2 / COUNT(x)`) / (COUNT(x) - 1)\nCase 6:\n**Conditions**: to compute population covariance\n**Transformations**: COVAR_POP(x, y) by applying a formula involving SUM and COUNT\nCase 7:\n**Conditions**: using a formula for sample covariance\n**Transformations**: COVAR_SAMP(x, y) using a formula involving SUM, COUNT, and an adjustment for sample calculations\nCase 8:\n**Conditions**: for transforming REGR_SXX(x, y) and REGR_SYY(x, y)\n**Transformations**: into expressions involving the computation of VAR_POP(x) or VAR_POP(y) respectively, multiplied by REGR_COUNT(x, y)"""\n\n### Rule JOIN_TO_CORRELATE:\n"""**Conditions**: The join type is either INNER JOIN or LEFT JOIN. There are no requirements in the query that would inherently create NULL values on the left side when there are no matching rows on the right side (for INNER JOIN, this condition is naturally met; for LEFT JOIN, it is met if every row on the left side has at least one corresponding row on the right side according to the join condition).\n**Transformations**: 1. Identify the INNER JOIN or LEFT JOIN condition in the SQL query. 2. Extract the ON clause representing the join condition. 3. For INNER JOIN: - Replace the INNER JOIN with a WHERE EXISTS clause, moving the original join condition into the WHERE clause of a subquery that selects from the right side table. Reference the left side columns as correlation variables in the subquery\'s WHERE clause. - Example Transformation: SELECT * FROM left_table INNER JOIN right_table ON left_table.id = right_table.foreign_id Becomes: SELECT * FROM left_table WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM right_table WHERE left_table.id = right_table.foreign_id) 4. For LEFT JOIN: - Replace the LEFT JOIN with a LEFT OUTER JOIN subquery that is correlated to the outer query. In the SELECT clause of the outer query, include a CASE statement or similar logic to handle selection from the subquery result. - Example Transformation: SELECT left_table.*, right_table.* FROM left_table LEFT JOIN right_table ON left_table.id = right_table.foreign_id Becomes: SELECT left_table.*, COALESCE(subquery.alias1, \'default\') FROM left_table LEFT OUTER JOIN (SELECT foreign_id, column1 AS alias1 FROM right_table) subquery ON left_table.id = subquery.foreign_id"""'}], 'response': 'Step 1: Evaluate each suggestion against the provided query rewrite rules.\n\n### Suggestion 1:\n1. **Filter conditions to `ON` clause or `LogicalFilter` nodes**: \n   - **Rule FILTER_INTO_JOIN**: This rule can be applied to move filter conditions that only reference columns from one side of the join into the `ON` clause.

Firstly, filter conditions that do not reference columns from both tables in an `INNER JOIN` can be moved to the `ON` clause or applied directly to the respective tables as `LogicalFilter` nodes, reducing dataset size before joins and improving execution efficiency. Secondly, complex `WHERE` clause conditions, such as `ca_state in (\'GA\', \'ME\', \'NC\')` and `cs_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 84 AND 89`, can be simplified using `SEARCH` predicates, allowing the query engine to leverage indexes for better performance. Thirdly, performing `GROUP BY` operations early through subqueries can reduce data size before joins, enhancing performance. Additionally, combining `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY` can optimize sorting by stopping once the required number of rows is obtained, especially if the columns in the `ORDER BY` clause are indexed. Lastly, repeated `CAST` operations in the `SELECT` clause can be optimized by pre-calculating these values using temporary tables or Common Table Expressions (CTEs), minimizing computational overhead during execution."""\n\nQuery Rewrite Rule Sets:\n### FILTER Operator Rules: ["FILTER_INTO_JOIN", "FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS", "PROJECT_FILTER_TRANSPOSE"]\n\n### JOIN Operator Rules: ["FILTER_INTO_JOIN"]\n\n### PROJECT Operator Rules: ["PROJECT_FILTER_TRANSPOSE"]\n\nQuery Rewrite Rule Explanations:\n### Rule FILTER_INTO_JOIN:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: This SQL query rewrite rule applies when a filter condition is placed on the result set of an INNER JOIN operation. The filter\'s expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there\'s a matching row in the non-preserving side\'s table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned."""\n\n### Rule FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains conditions that can be statically determined as always true (e.g., constant expressions like `1=1` or tautologies based on the column data types and constraints), then these conditions don\'t affect the result set.\n**Transformations**: Remove such conditions from the WHERE clause. If this results in an empty WHERE clause, remove the WHERE clause entirely.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause simplifies to conditions that are always false or involve comparisons with NULL in a way that the outcome is always false or NULL (e.g., `column != column` or `1=0`), indicating no rows can satisfy the filter.\n**Transformations**: Replace the query with one that selects no rows. This could be represented in different ways based on the SQL dialect. One universal method might be selecting from a dual table with a false condition.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains complex conditions that can be simplified based on known constraints, constants, or through logical simplification (e.g., `column IS NOT NULL AND column IS NOT NULL` simplifies to `column IS NOT NULL`).\n**Transformations**: Simplify the conditions according to logical rules and known constraints. Remove redundancy and unnecessary complexity."""\n\n### Rule PROJECT_FILTER_TRANSPOSE:\n"""**Conditions**: This rewrite rule can be applied when an SQL query contains a SELECT operation (acting as the `Project` operation) followed by a WHERE clause (acting as the `Filter` operation), provided that the SELECT does not contain window functions (such as RANK(), ROW_NUMBER(), etc.) and the columns selected do not affect the outcome of the WHERE clause.\n**Transformations**: To apply the rule, refactor the SQL query so that the conditions in the WHERE clause are evaluated before the columns are selected in the SELECT clause. This may involve moving computations or column transformations from the SELECT clause to a sub-query that the WHERE clause is applied on, ensuring the final SELECT clause on the outermost query matches the original query\'s expected outcome. - Before: SELECT col1, transformation_function(col2) FROM table WHERE condition; - After: SELECT col1, transformation_function(col2) FROM (SELECT col1, col2 FROM table WHERE condition) AS subquery;"""'}], 'response': 'Step 1: To align the query rewrite rules with the provided suggestions, we need to prioritize rules that directly address the suggestions.

The rules are designed to reduce the dataset size before performing expensive operations like joins and aggregations, simplify expressions, and ensure that filtering is done as early as possible.\n\nLet\'s analyze the rules and their sequences:\n\n1. **FILTER_INTO_JOIN**: This rule is crucial for moving filter conditions into the join conditions, which reduces the dataset size before the join operation. This is particularly effective when the filter conditions only involve columns from one side of the join.\n\n2. **FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS**: This rule simplifies the WHERE clause by removing redundant or always-true conditions, which can help in reducing unnecessary computations.\n\n3. **PROJECT_FILTER_TRANSPOSE**: This rule ensures that filtering is done before projection, which can be beneficial when the SELECT clause involves complex transformations that are not needed for filtering.\n\nGiven the rule subset sequences:\n- **Rule Sequence 1**: ["FILTER_INTO_JOIN", "FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS"]\n- **Rule Sequence 2**: ["FILTER_INTO_JOIN"]\n- **Rule Sequence 3**: ["PROJECT_FILTER_TRANSPOSE"]\n\nWe can deduce the overall sequence for all rules.

Firstly, filter conditions that do not reference columns from both tables in an `INNER JOIN` can be moved to the `ON` clause or applied directly to the respective tables as `LogicalFilter` nodes, reducing dataset size before joins and improving execution efficiency. Secondly, complex `WHERE` clause conditions, such as `ca_state in (\'GA\', \'ME\', \'NC\')` and `cs_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 84 AND 89`, can be simplified using `SEARCH` predicates, allowing the query engine to leverage indexes for better performance. Thirdly, performing `GROUP BY` operations early through subqueries can reduce data size before joins, enhancing performance. Additionally, combining `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY` can optimize sorting by stopping once the required number of rows is obtained, especially if the columns in the `ORDER BY` clause are indexed. Lastly, repeated `CAST` operations in the `SELECT` clause can be optimized by pre-calculating these values using temporary tables or Common Table Expressions (CTEs), minimizing computational overhead during execution."""\n\nQuery Rewrite Rules:\n### Rule FILTER_INTO_JOIN:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: This SQL query rewrite rule applies when a filter condition is placed on the result set of an INNER JOIN operation. The filter\'s expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there\'s a matching row in the non-preserving side\'s table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned."""\n\n### Rule FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains conditions that can be statically determined as always true (e.g., constant expressions like `1=1` or tautologies based on the column data types and constraints), then these conditions don\'t affect the result set.\n**Transformations**: Remove such conditions from the WHERE clause. If this results in an empty WHERE clause, remove the WHERE clause entirely.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause simplifies to conditions that are always false or involve comparisons with NULL in a way that the outcome is always false or NULL (e.g., `column != column` or `1=0`), indicating no rows can satisfy the filter.\n**Transformations**: Replace the query with one that selects no rows.

Finally, "FILTER_INTO_JOIN" can be applied to move applicable filter conditions to the `ON` clause.\n\n```python\n["FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS", "PROJECT_FILTER_TRANSPOSE", "FILTER_INTO_JOIN"]\n```', 'time': 4.480323553085327}
