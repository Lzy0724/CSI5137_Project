Transform `(x AND y) OR z` into `(x OR z) AND (y OR z)`.\n2. Transform `(x OR y) AND z` into `(x AND z) OR (y AND z)`.\n"""\nRule 2:\n"""\n**Conditions**: The SQL query utilizes traditional filtering mechanisms such as NOT EXISTS, NOT IN, EXISTS, IN, OR within JOINs and WHERE clauses.\n**Transformations**: - Replace IN with INTERSECT for querying intersecting datasets to potentially improve index usage and query speed.\n- Rewrite conditions using the OR operator into a series of UNION ALL operations to enhance code maintainability and performance.\n- Use EXCEPT instead of NOT IN or anti-joins to minimize duplicate row processing and optimize resource use, effectively reducing execution time.\n"""\nRule 3:\n"""\n**Conditions**: The SQL query optimization rules apply under the following conditions:\n1. When the `LIMIT` clause is used to fetch a specified number of rows.\n2. When `ORDER BY` is used in conjunction with `LIMIT` to sort and limit the number of rows retrieved, particularly when sorting can leverage an index.\n3. When `DISTINCT` is used along with `LIMIT` to quickly identify and return unique rows without scanning the full dataset.\n4. During the use of `GROUP BY`, where optimization might involve sorting or traversing indexes in order to efficiently compute group values without processing the entire dataset.\n5. When sorting a specific number of rows from a single table based on non-indexed columns, utilizing in-memory sorting (`filesort`) techniques.\n**Transformations**: The specific SQL transformations that emerge from applying these optimization rules are:\n1. Combining `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY` encourages the database engine to stop the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained, avoiding full table sorts.\n2. Using `LIMIT` with `DISTINCT` leads to an early termination of the search for unique rows as soon as the needed amount is gathered, reducing time and resources spent on scanning the entire dataset.\n3. In the context of `GROUP BY`, optimizations may include indexing strategies or modifications to the way sorting is handled, such as employing `filesort` mechanisms that do not require temporary tables, ensuring that the database engine processes only the necessary data for group computations.\n4. Efficiencies are gained by encouraging the use of indexed columns with `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT`, making queries more efficient by reducing the cost associated with sorting and filtering operations.\n"""\nRule 4:\n"""\n**Conditions**: The SQL query rewrite rule applies when there are:\n- Functions or operations (especially deterministic ones) within the SELECT, WHERE, JOIN conditions, or any part of the query that is executed multiple times for the same row.\n- The presence of potentially computationally expensive operations or function calls that are not dependent on the data of the specific row and thus can be optimized.\n**Transformations**: 1. Move repeated function calls or operations outside of loops, if applicable. For example, if a function that generates a calculated value based on constants or parameters (not row-specific data) is being called in a loop, calculate the value once before the loop and store the result for reuse.\n   \n2. Replace inline functions in the SELECT or WHERE clause with a pre-calculated column if the function is deterministic and the input data does not change frequently. This might involve:\n   - Creating a temporary table that includes the results of the expensive function calls.\n   - Using a subquery or a Common Table Expression (CTE) that calculates the value once and then joins it with the main query.\n   \n3. When using aggregate functions that are called multiple times with the same parameters, consider storing the result in a variable or a temporary table, especially if the data set is large.\n\n4. Avoid using functions on indexed columns in the WHERE clause. This prevents the database from using the index efficiently. If a function must be used, consider creating a computed column that pre-calculates the function\'s result and index that column instead.\n\n5. If possible, simplify expressions and calculations to reduce their complexity and execution time. This might involve algebraic simplification or breaking down complex calculations into simpler parts that can be calculated separately and then combined.\n\nExample:\nOriginal Query:\n```sql\nSELECT id, name, expensive_function(column) as expensive_result\nFROM table\nWHERE expensive_function(column) > 100;\n```\n\nTransformed Query using a CTE:\n```sql\nWITH PreCalculated AS (\n  SELECT id, name, column, expensive_function(column) as expensive_result\n  FROM table\n)\nSELECT id, name, expensive_sel as expensive_result\nFROM PreCalculated\nWHERE expensive_result > 100;\n```\n"""\nRule 5:\n"""\n**Conditions**: The rule applies when the original SQL query performs multiple scans or joins on the same table to retrieve different attributes for certain conditions, or when the query structure results in redundant data processing and complexity that could be reduced.\n**Transformations**: - Combine multiple joins into a single join operation by using `CASE` statements to conditionally select different attributes from the table in one pass. \n- Use the `COALESCE` function in conjunction with `CASE` statements to efficiently merge conditional attributes into distinct columns based on specific criteria without the need for additional joins.\n- Optimize the selection of conditional attributes by integrating `GROUP BY` with aggregate functions like `MAX` within `CASE` statements, thus condensing the result set to only the necessary data and avoiding needless retrieval and processing steps.\n- The overall transformation leads to a single, more efficient query that accomplishes the tasks of multiple, less efficient operations, improving performance, and simplifying the query for better readability and maintenance.\n"""'}], 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'stream': False, 'temperature': 0.1}}

The `LogicalAggregate` now directly uses `SUM($22)` instead of `SUM($0)`, which suggests that the projection layer was eliminated. Additionally, the `LogicalJoin` and `LogicalTableScan` operations remain largely unchanged, indicating that the main focus of the rewrite was on simplifying the aggregation process.\n\nStep 2: Parsing the logical plan changes, we observe that the SQL query initially had a projection layer (`LogicalProject`) that was projecting `cs_ext_discount_amt`. This layer has been removed, and the aggregation (`SUM`) is now applied directly to the column `cs_ext_discount_amt` from the `catalog_sales` table. The `LogicalFilter` conditions remain the same, indicating that the filtering logic was not altered. The `LogicalJoin` operations also remain unchanged, maintaining the joins between `catalog_sales`, `item`, and `date_dim` tables.\n\nStep 3: The query rewrite rule contains two cases. Case 1 involves simplifying a query with a `GROUP BY` clause, which does not apply here as there is no `GROUP BY` in the original query. Case 2 involves removing an inner `SELECT` layer when the outer query's `SELECT` clause matches the columns used in the inner query's `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions. The parsed changes show that the inner projection layer was removed, and the aggregation was applied directly, which aligns with Case 2.\n\nStep 4: The SQL query changes can be explained by Case 2 of the query rewrite rule. The original query had an inner projection layer that was projecting `cs_ext_discount_amt`, which was unnecessary since the outer query's `SELECT` clause directly used this column for aggregation. By removing this projection layer, the rewrite rule simplifies the query, allowing the `SUM` function to operate directly on `cs_ext_discount_amt` from the `catalog_sales` table. This transformation eliminates redundant operations and streamlines the query execution plan, resulting in a more efficient query.", 'time': 4.925083637237549}

The original plan had a scalar sub-query that calculated `1.3 * avg(cs_ext_discount_amt)` from `catalog_sales` and `date_dim` tables, which was then used in a comparison in the WHERE clause. The rewritten plan replaces this scalar sub-query with a LEFT JOIN, indicating that the query rewrite rule has been applied to transform the scalar sub-query into a join operation.\n\nStep 2: Parsing the logical plan changes, we see that the original scalar sub-query:\n```sql\nselect\n    1.3 * avg(cs_ext_discount_amt)\nfrom\n    catalog_sales\n    ,date_dim\nwhere\n    cs_item_sk = i_item_sk\n    and d_date between '2000-03-06' and cast('2000-03-06' as date) + interval '90' day\n    and d_date_sk = cs_sold_date_sk\n    and cs_list_price between 80 and 109\n    and cs_sales_price / cs_list_price BETWEEN 80 * 0.01 AND 100 * 0.01\n```\nhas been transformed into a LEFT JOIN operation.

The changes in the SQL query match Case 1 of the query rewrite rule. Case 1 applies when there is a scalar sub-query within the WHERE clause, which is transformed into a LEFT JOIN operation with an aggregate function. The transformation involves using the correlation ID (`cs_item_sk`) to join the sub-query result with the outer query.\n\nStep 4: The SQL query changes can be explained as follows: The original scalar sub-query that calculated `1.3 * avg(cs_ext_discount_amt)` was used in a comparison within the WHERE clause of the main query. This scalar sub-query was transformed into a LEFT JOIN operation. The transformation involved creating a sub-query that calculates the average of `cs_ext_discount_amt` grouped by `cs_item_sk` and then joining this result with the outer query using `cs_item_sk` as the join condition. This allows the main query to directly compare `cs_ext_discount_amt` with the aggregated result from the sub-query, thus eliminating the need for a scalar sub-query and improving query performance by leveraging join operations.", 'time': 5.190515756607056}

When the `LIMIT` clause is used to fetch a specified number of rows.\n2. When `ORDER BY` is used in conjunction with `LIMIT` to sort and limit the number of rows retrieved, particularly when sorting can leverage an index.\n3.

Using `LIMIT` with `DISTINCT` leads to an early termination of the search for unique rows as soon as the needed amount is gathered, reducing time and resources spent on scanning the entire dataset.\n3. In the context of `GROUP BY`, optimizations may include indexing strategies or modifications to the way sorting is handled, such as employing `filesort` mechanisms that do not require temporary tables, ensuring that the database engine processes only the necessary data for group computations.\n4. Efficiencies are gained by encouraging the use of indexed columns with `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT`, making queries more efficient by reducing the cost associated with sorting and filtering operations.\n"""\nRule 4:\n"""\n**Conditions**: The SQL query rewrite rule applies when there are:\n- Functions or operations (especially deterministic ones) within the SELECT, WHERE, JOIN conditions, or any part of the query that is executed multiple times for the same row.\n- The presence of potentially computationally expensive operations or function calls that are not dependent on the data of the specific row and thus can be optimized.\n**Transformations**: 1. Move repeated function calls or operations outside of loops, if applicable. For example, if a function that generates a calculated value based on constants or parameters (not row-specific data) is being called in a loop, calculate the value once before the loop and store the result for reuse.\n   \n2. Replace inline functions in the SELECT or WHERE clause with a pre-calculated column if the function is deterministic and the input data does not change frequently. This might involve:\n   - Creating a temporary table that includes the results of the expensive function calls.\n   - Using a subquery or a Common Table Expression (CTE) that calculates the value once and then joins it with the main query.\n   \n3. When using aggregate functions that are called multiple times with the same parameters, consider storing the result in a variable or a temporary table, especially if the data set is large.\n\n4. Avoid using functions on indexed columns in the WHERE clause. This prevents the database from using the index efficiently. If a function must be used, consider creating a computed column that pre-calculates the function\'s result and index that column instead.\n\n5. If possible, simplify expressions and calculations to reduce their complexity and execution time. This might involve algebraic simplification or breaking down complex calculations into simpler parts that can be calculated separately and then combined.\n\nExample:\nOriginal Query:\n```sql\nSELECT id, name, expensive_function(column) as expensive_result\nFROM table\nWHERE expensive_function(column) > 100;\n```\n\nTransformed Query using a CTE:\n```sql\nWITH PreCalculated AS (\n  SELECT id, name, column, expensive_function(column) as expensive_result\n  FROM table\n)\nSELECT id, name, expensive_sel as expensive_result\nFROM PreCalculated\nWHERE expensive_result > 100;\n```\n"""\nRule 5:\n"""\n**Conditions**: The rule applies when the original SQL query performs multiple scans or joins on the same table to retrieve different attributes for certain conditions, or when the query structure results in redundant data processing and complexity that could be reduced.\n**Transformations**: - Combine multiple joins into a single join operation by using `CASE` statements to conditionally select different attributes from the table in one pass. \n- Use the `COALESCE` function in conjunction with `CASE` statements to efficiently merge conditional attributes into distinct columns based on specific criteria without the need for additional joins.\n- Optimize the selection of conditional attributes by integrating `GROUP BY` with aggregate functions like `MAX` within `CASE` statements, thus condensing the result set to only the necessary data and avoiding needless retrieval and processing steps.\n- The overall transformation leads to a single, more efficient query that accomplishes the tasks of multiple, less efficient operations, improving performance, and simplifying the query for better readability and maintenance.\n"""'}], 'response': 'Step 1: Analyze the given SQL query against each rule\'s conditions to determine applicability.\n\n- **Rule 1**: The query contains a complex `WHERE` clause with `AND`/`OR` nesting, specifically `(i_manufact_id in (214, 376, 518, 755, 996) or i_manager_id BETWEEN 71 and 100)`. This matches the conditions for Rule 1.\n\n- **Rule 2**: The query uses `IN` within the `WHERE` clause, which matches the conditions for Rule 2. However, the query does not use `NOT EXISTS`, `NOT IN`, `EXISTS`, or `EXCEPT`, so only the `IN` condition is relevant.\n\n- **Rule 3**: The query uses `LIMIT` and `ORDER BY`, which matches the conditions for Rule 3. However, the query does not use `DISTINCT` or `GROUP BY`, so only the `LIMIT` and `ORDER BY` condition is relevant.\n\n- **Rule 4**: The query uses the `CAST` function and `INTERVAL` operation in the `WHERE` clause, which are deterministic and executed multiple times for the same row. This matches the conditions for Rule 4.\n\n- **Rule 5**: The query does not perform multiple scans or joins on the same table for different attributes, nor does it have redundant data processing that could be reduced by combining joins. Therefore, Rule 5 does not match.\n\nStep 2: Apply the transformations from the matched rules to the SQL query.\n\nQuery Rewrite 1:\n```sql\n-- Original condition: (i_manufact_id in (214, 376, 518, 755, 996) or i_manager_id BETWEEN 71 and 100)\n-- Apply transformation: (x OR y) AND z into (x AND z) OR (y AND z)\n-- However, this transformation does not directly apply to the current structure as it is already in a simplified form.\n-- No transformation is needed for this specific condition as it does not fit the exact pattern for transformation.\n```\n\nQuery Rewrite 2:\n```sql\n-- Original condition: i_manufact_id in (214, 376, 518, 755, 996)\n-- Transformation: Replace IN with INTERSECT for querying intersecting datasets\n-- However, INTERSECT is not directly applicable here as it is used for set operations between queries, not within a single condition.\n-- No transformation is applied as the condition does not involve intersecting datasets from multiple queries.\n```\n\nQuery Rewrite 3:\n```sql\n-- Original query uses ORDER BY sum(cs_ext_discount_amt) LIMIT 100\n-- Transformation: Combining LIMIT with ORDER BY encourages the database engine to stop the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained.\n-- This transformation is already implicitly applied by the query structure, so no explicit change is needed.\n```\n\nQuery Rewrite 4:\n```sql\n-- Original condition: d_date between \'2000-03-06\' and cast(\'2000-03-06\' as date) + interval \'90\' day\n-- Transformation: Move repeated function calls or operations outside of loops\n-- Pre-calculate the date range once and use it in the query\nWITH DateRange AS (\n  SELECT cast(\'2000-03-06\' as date) + interval \'90\' day as end_date\n)\nSELECT sum(cs_ext_discount_amt) as "excess discount amount"\nFROM catalog_sales, item, date_dim, DateRange\nWHERE (i_manufact_id in (214, 376, 518, 755, 996) or i_manager_id BETWEEN 71 and 100)\nAND i_item_sk = cs_item_sk\nAND d_date between \'2000-03-06\' and DateRange.end_date\nAND d_date_sk = cs_sold_date_sk\nAND cs_ext_discount_amt > (\n  SELECT 1.3 * avg(cs_ext_discount_amt)\n  FROM catalog_sales, date_dim\n  WHERE cs_item_sk = i_item_sk\n  AND d_date between \'2000-03-06\' and DateRange.end_date\n  AND d_date_sk = cs_sold_date_sk\n  AND cs_list_price between 80 and 109\n  AND cs_sales_price / cs_list_price BETWEEN 80 * 0.01 AND 100 * 0.01\n)\nORDER BY sum(cs_ext_discount_amt)\nLIMIT 100;\n```\n\nIn summary, the query primarily benefits from Rule 4 by pre-calculating the date range, which reduces redundant computation. Other rules either do not apply directly or are already implicitly optimized by the query structure.', 'time': 6.544660568237305}

When `ORDER BY` is used in conjunction with `LIMIT` to sort and limit the number of rows retrieved, particularly when sorting can leverage an index.\n3. When `DISTINCT` is used along with `LIMIT` to quickly identify and return unique rows without scanning the full dataset.\n4. During the use of `GROUP BY`, where optimization might involve sorting or traversing indexes in order to efficiently compute group values without processing the entire dataset.\n5. When sorting a specific number of rows from a single table based on non-indexed columns, utilizing in-memory sorting (`filesort`) techniques.\n**Transformations**: The specific SQL transformations that emerge from applying these optimization rules are:\n1. Combining `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY` encourages the database engine to stop the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained, avoiding full table sorts.\n2. Using `LIMIT` with `DISTINCT` leads to an early termination of the search for unique rows as soon as the needed amount is gathered, reducing time and resources spent on scanning the entire dataset.\n3. In the context of `GROUP BY`, optimizations may include indexing strategies or modifications to the way sorting is handled, such as employing `filesort` mechanisms that do not require temporary tables, ensuring that the database engine processes only the necessary data for group computations.\n4. Efficiencies are gained by encouraging the use of indexed columns with `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT`, making queries more efficient by reducing the cost associated with sorting and filtering operations.\n"""\nRule 4:\n"""\n**Conditions**: The SQL query rewrite rule applies when there are:\n- Functions or operations (especially deterministic ones) within the SELECT, WHERE, JOIN conditions, or any part of the query that is executed multiple times for the same row.\n- The presence of potentially computationally expensive operations or function calls that are not dependent on the data of the specific row and thus can be optimized.\n**Transformations**: 1. Move repeated function calls or operations outside of loops, if applicable. For example, if a function that generates a calculated value based on constants or parameters (not row-specific data) is being called in a loop, calculate the value once before the loop and store the result for reuse.\n   \n2. Replace inline functions in the SELECT or WHERE clause with a pre-calculated column if the function is deterministic and the input data does not change frequently. This might involve:\n   - Creating a temporary table that includes the results of the expensive function calls.\n   - Using a subquery or a Common Table Expression (CTE) that calculates the value once and then joins it with the main query.\n   \n3. When using aggregate functions that are called multiple times with the same parameters, consider storing the result in a variable or a temporary table, especially if the data set is large.\n\n4. Avoid using functions on indexed columns in the WHERE clause. This prevents the database from using the index efficiently. If a function must be used, consider creating a computed column that pre-calculates the function\'s result and index that column instead.\n\n5. If possible, simplify expressions and calculations to reduce their complexity and execution time. This might involve algebraic simplification or breaking down complex calculations into simpler parts that can be calculated separately and then combined.\n\nExample:\nOriginal Query:\n```sql\nSELECT id, name, expensive_function(column) as expensive_result\nFROM table\nWHERE expensive_function(column) > 100;\n```\n\nTransformed Query using a CTE:\n```sql\nWITH PreCalculated AS (\n  SELECT id, name, column, expensive_function(column) as expensive_result\n  FROM table\n)\nSELECT id, name, expensive_sel as expensive_result\nFROM PreCalculated\nWHERE expensive_result > 100;\n```\n"""\nRule 5:\n"""\n**Conditions**: The rule applies when the original SQL query performs multiple scans or joins on the same table to retrieve different attributes for certain conditions, or when the query structure results in redundant data processing and complexity that could be reduced.\n**Transformations**: - Combine multiple joins into a single join operation by using `CASE` statements to conditionally select different attributes from the table in one pass. \n- Use the `COALESCE` function in conjunction with `CASE` statements to efficiently merge conditional attributes into distinct columns based on specific criteria without the need for additional joins.\n- Optimize the selection of conditional attributes by integrating `GROUP BY` with aggregate functions like `MAX` within `CASE` statements, thus condensing the result set to only the necessary data and avoiding needless retrieval and processing steps.\n- The overall transformation leads to a single, more efficient query that accomplishes the tasks of multiple, less efficient operations, improving performance, and simplifying the query for better readability and maintenance.\n"""'}], 'response': 'Step 1: Analyze the given SQL query against each rule\'s conditions to determine applicability.\n\n- **Rule 1**: The query contains a complex `WHERE` clause with `AND`/`OR` nesting, specifically `(i_manufact_id in (214, 376, 518, 755, 996) or i_manager_id BETWEEN 71 and 100)`. This matches the condition for Rule 1, which deals with optimizing such nested conditions.\n\n- **Rule 2**: The query uses `IN` within the `WHERE` clause, but it does not use `EXISTS`, `NOT EXISTS`, or `NOT IN`.

Query 1: The SQL query changes can be explained by Case 2 of the query rewrite rule. The original query had an inner projection layer that was projecting `cs_ext_discount_amt`, which was unnecessary since the outer query's `SELECT` clause directly used this column for aggregation. By removing this projection layer, the rewrite rule simplifies the query, allowing the `SUM` function to operate directly on `cs_ext_discount_amt` from the `catalog_sales` table. This transformation eliminates redundant operations and streamlines the query execution plan, resulting in a more efficient query.
Query 2: The SQL query changes can be explained as follows: The original scalar sub-query that calculated `1.3 * avg(cs_ext_discount_amt)` was used in a comparison within the WHERE clause of the main query. This scalar sub-query was transformed into a LEFT JOIN operation. The transformation involved creating a sub-query that calculates the average of `cs_ext_discount_amt` grouped by `cs_item_sk` and then joining this result with the outer query using `cs_item_sk` as the join condition. This allows the main query to directly compare `cs_ext_discount_amt` with the aggregated result from the sub-query, thus eliminating the need for a scalar sub-query and improving query performance by leveraging join operations.
Query 3: The original query has a complex `WHERE` clause with `(i_manufact_id in (214, 376, 518, 755, 996) or i_manager_id BETWEEN 71 and 100)`. According to Rule 1, we can transform this using the distributive law of logic. However, since the transformation `(x AND y) OR z` into `(x OR z) AND (y OR z)` or `(x OR y) AND z` into `(x AND z) OR (y AND z)` does not simplify the logic in this specific context without additional context or simplification, the transformation might not be directly applicable. Therefore, no transformation is applied here as it would not optimize the query further.
Query 4: The query uses `LIMIT 100` and `ORDER BY sum(cs_ext_discount_amt)`. Rule 3 suggests that combining `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY` encourages the database engine to stop the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained, avoiding full table sorts. This is already implemented in the query, so no further transformation is needed. However, ensuring that `cs_ext_discount_amt` is indexed could further optimize the query.
Query 5: The query contains the operation `cast('2000-03-06' as date) + interval '90' day` in the `WHERE` clause, which is deterministic and repeated. According to Rule 4, we can pre-calculate this value and use it directly in the query to avoid recalculating it for each row. The transformed query would look like this:

```sql

          and d_date_sk = cs_sold_date_sk
          and cs_list_price between 80 and 109
          and cs_sales_price / cs_list_price BETWEEN 80 * 0.01 AND 100 * 0.01

"""The SQL query changes can be explained by Case 2 of the query rewrite rule. The original query had an inner projection layer that was projecting `cs_ext_discount_amt`, which was unnecessary since the outer query's `SELECT` clause directly used this column for aggregation. By removing this projection layer, the rewrite rule simplifies the query, allowing the `SUM` function to operate directly on `cs_ext_discount_amt` from the `catalog_sales` table. This transformation eliminates redundant operations and streamlines the query execution plan, resulting in a more efficient query."""

Query Rewrite 2:
"""The SQL query changes can be explained as follows: The original scalar sub-query that calculated `1.3 * avg(cs_ext_discount_amt)` was used in a comparison within the WHERE clause of the main query. This scalar sub-query was transformed into a LEFT JOIN operation. The transformation involved creating a sub-query that calculates the average of `cs_ext_discount_amt` grouped by `cs_item_sk` and then joining this result with the outer query using `cs_item_sk` as the join condition. This allows the main query to directly compare `cs_ext_discount_amt` with the aggregated result from the sub-query, thus eliminating the need for a scalar sub-query and improving query performance by leveraging join operations."""

Query Rewrite 3:

According to Rule 1, we can transform this using the distributive law of logic. However, since the transformation `(x AND y) OR z` into `(x OR z) AND (y OR z)` or `(x OR y) AND z` into `(x AND z) OR (y AND z)` does not simplify the logic in this specific context without additional context or simplification, the transformation might not be directly applicable. Therefore, no transformation is applied here as it would not optimize the query further."""

Query Rewrite 4:
"""The query uses `LIMIT 100` and `ORDER BY sum(cs_ext_discount_amt)`. Rule 3 suggests that combining `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY` encourages the database engine to stop the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained, avoiding full table sorts. This is already implemented in the query, so no further transformation is needed. However, ensuring that `cs_ext_discount_amt` is indexed could further optimize the query."""

Query Rewrite 5:

By removing this projection layer, the rewrite rule simplifies the query, allowing the `SUM` function to operate directly on `cs_ext_discount_amt` from the `catalog_sales` table. This transformation eliminates redundant operations and streamlines the query execution plan, resulting in a more efficient query."""\n\nQuery Rewrite 2:\n"""The SQL query changes can be explained as follows: The original scalar sub-query that calculated `1.3 * avg(cs_ext_discount_amt)` was used in a comparison within the WHERE clause of the main query. This scalar sub-query was transformed into a LEFT JOIN operation. The transformation involved creating a sub-query that calculates the average of `cs_ext_discount_amt` grouped by `cs_item_sk` and then joining this result with the outer query using `cs_item_sk` as the join condition. This allows the main query to directly compare `cs_ext_discount_amt` with the aggregated result from the sub-query, thus eliminating the need for a scalar sub-query and improving query performance by leveraging join operations."""\n\nQuery Rewrite 3:\n"""The original query has a complex `WHERE` clause with `(i_manufact_id in (214, 376, 518, 755, 996) or i_manager_id BETWEEN 71 and 100)`. According to Rule 1, we can transform this using the distributive law of logic. However, since the transformation `(x AND y) OR z` into `(x OR z) AND (y OR z)` or `(x OR y) AND z` into `(x AND z) OR (y AND z)` does not simplify the logic in this specific context without additional context or simplification, the transformation might not be directly applicable. Therefore, no transformation is applied here as it would not optimize the query further."""\n\nQuery Rewrite 4:\n"""The query uses `LIMIT 100` and `ORDER BY sum(cs_ext_discount_amt)`. Rule 3 suggests that combining `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY` encourages the database engine to stop the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained, avoiding full table sorts.

Second, the scalar sub-query calculating `1.3 * avg(cs_ext_discount_amt)` is transformed into a LEFT JOIN operation, which calculates the average grouped by `cs_item_sk` and joins this result with the main query, eliminating the need for a scalar sub-query and enhancing performance through join operations. Third, although the complex `WHERE` clause could theoretically be transformed using the distributive law of logic, no simplification is applied as it does not optimize the query further in this context. Fourth, the use of `LIMIT 100` combined with `ORDER BY` is already optimized, as it encourages the database engine to stop sorting once the required number of rows is obtained, though indexing `cs_ext_discount_amt` could further enhance performance. Lastly, the deterministic operation `cast(\'2000-03-06\' as date) + interval \'90\' day` is pre-calculated using a common table expression (CTE) to avoid repeated computation, reducing overhead by calculating the date range once and reusing it throughout the query."""\n\nQuery Rewrite Rules:\n### Rule AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: - The SQL query contains a `GROUP BY` clause that groups by simple columns (no expressions in the `GROUP BY` list).\n- The aggregate functions in the `SELECT` clause operate directly on columns (no expressions inside the aggregate functions).\n- The `SELECT` clause only contains the columns used in the `GROUP BY` clause and the aggregates without any transformations or additional expressions.\n**Transformations**: - Directly apply the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions to the data source referred to in the `FROM` clause of the inner query before the projection.\n- Eliminate the outer projection layer if it only renames the columns without transforming them.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: - The `SELECT` clause of an outer query precisely matches the columns used in the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions of an inner query, without any column transformations or renamings.\n- The inner `SELECT` only serves as a passthrough for these columns.\n**Transformations**: - Remove the inner `SELECT` layer, directly applying the aggregate functions and `GROUP BY` to the original data source."""\n\n### Rule FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: The query contains a scalar sub-query within the WHERE clause.\n**Transformations**: The scalar sub-query should be transformed into a LEFT JOIN operation with an aggregate function on the column(s) being selected in the sub-query.

The rule subset sequences provided suggest that the rules "AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE" and "FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE" are applied independently in different contexts.\n\n1. **AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE**: This rule is applied to simplify the query by removing unnecessary projection layers. In the given query, the `SUM` function operates directly on `cs_ext_discount_amt`, which aligns with the conditions of this rule. Therefore, this rule should be applied first to streamline the execution plan.\n\n2. **FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE**: This rule is applied to transform scalar sub-queries into join operations. The query contains a scalar sub-query within the `WHERE` clause that calculates `1.3 * avg(cs_ext_discount_amt)`. This sub-query can be transformed into a LEFT JOIN operation, which is more efficient. This rule should be applied after the projection merge to handle the sub-query transformation.\n\nThe rule subset sequences indicate that these rules are applied independently, but in the context of the entire query, they should be applied in the order that addresses the structure of the query most effectively. Since the projection merge simplifies the query structure, it should be applied first, followed by the transformation of the sub-query.\n\nThus, the overall sequence for applying the rules is:\n1. **AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE**\n2. **FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE**\n\nThis sequence ensures that the query is optimized by first simplifying the projection and then transforming the sub-query into a more efficient join operation.\n\n```python\n["AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE", "FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE"]\n```', 'time': 4.730265140533447}

If so, you should prioritize such unutilized potential rules over the utilized rules.\n\nStep 2: Determine the overall sequence for all the rules, so that the new arrangement can better match the provided query rewrite suggestions.\n\nOutput in the following format:\nStep 1: <step 1 reasoning>\nStep 2: <step 2 reasoning>\n, then a python list of re-arranged rule names encapsulated with ```python and ```, formatted as:\n```python\n["rule_name_1", "rule_name_2", ...]\n```\n, where the sequence of the list corresponds to the re-arranged order of all the provided rules.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': '\nSQL Query:\n```sql\nselect  sum(cs_ext_discount_amt)  as "excess discount amount"\nfrom\n   catalog_sales\n   ,item\n   ,date_dim\nwhere\n(i_manufact_id in (214, 376, 518, 755, 996)\nor i_manager_id BETWEEN 71 and 100)\nand i_item_sk = cs_item_sk\nand d_date between \'2000-03-06\' and\n        cast(\'2000-03-06\' as date) + interval \'90\' day\nand d_date_sk = cs_sold_date_sk\nand cs_ext_discount_amt\n     > (\n         select\n            1.3 * avg(cs_ext_discount_amt)\n         from\n            catalog_sales\n           ,date_dim\n         where\n              cs_item_sk = i_item_sk\n          and d_date between \'2000-03-06\' and\n                             cast(\'2000-03-06\' as date) + interval \'90\' day\n          and d_date_sk = cs_sold_date_sk\n          and cs_list_price between 80 and 109\n          and cs_sales_price / cs_list_price BETWEEN 80 * 0.01 AND 100 * 0.01\n      )\norder by sum(cs_ext_discount_amt)\nlimit 100;\n```\n\nQuery Rewrite Suggestions:\n### Suggestion 1:\n"""The provided SQL query can be optimized using several rewrite strategies. First, by removing an unnecessary inner projection layer that projected `cs_ext_discount_amt`, the query is simplified, allowing the `SUM` function to operate directly on this column, thus streamlining the execution plan. Second, the scalar sub-query calculating `1.3 * avg(cs_ext_discount_amt)` is transformed into a LEFT JOIN operation, which calculates the average grouped by `cs_item_sk` and joins this result with the main query, eliminating the need for a scalar sub-query and enhancing performance through join operations. Third, although the complex `WHERE` clause could theoretically be transformed using the distributive law of logic, no simplification is applied as it does not optimize the query further in this context. Fourth, the use of `LIMIT 100` combined with `ORDER BY` is already optimized, as it encourages the database engine to stop sorting once the required number of rows is obtained, though indexing `cs_ext_discount_amt` could further enhance performance. Lastly, the deterministic operation `cast(\'2000-03-06\' as date) + interval \'90\' day` is pre-calculated using a common table expression (CTE) to avoid repeated computation, reducing overhead by calculating the date range once and reusing it throughout the query."""\n\nQuery Rewrite Rules:\n### Rule AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: - The SQL query contains a `GROUP BY` clause that groups by simple columns (no expressions in the `GROUP BY` list).\n- The aggregate functions in the `SELECT` clause operate directly on columns (no expressions inside the aggregate functions).\n- The `SELECT` clause only contains the columns used in the `GROUP BY` clause and the aggregates without any transformations or additional expressions.\n**Transformations**: - Directly apply the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions to the data source referred to in the `FROM` clause of the inner query before the projection.\n- Eliminate the outer projection layer if it only renames the columns without transforming them.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: - The `SELECT` clause of an outer query precisely matches the columns used in the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions of an inner query, without any column transformations or renamings.\n- The inner `SELECT` only serves as a passthrough for these columns.\n**Transformations**: - Remove the inner `SELECT` layer, directly applying the aggregate functions and `GROUP BY` to the original data source."""\n\n### Rule FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: The query contains a scalar sub-query within the WHERE clause.\n**Transformations**: The scalar sub-query should be transformed into a LEFT JOIN operation with an aggregate function on the column(s) being selected in the sub-query. The JOIN condition uses the correlation ID (the matching column(s) in both outer and sub-query).\n  - Original Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 WHERE column = (SELECT AGG_FUNCTION(column2) FROM table2 WHERE table1.join_column = table2.join_column)\n  - Transformed Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 LEFT JOIN (SELECT join_column, AGG_FUNCTION(column2) AS agg_result FROM table2 GROUP BY join_column) AS sub_query ON table1.join_column = sub_query.join_column WHERE column = sub_query.agg_result\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: The query contains `IN`, `EXISTS`, or `UNIQUE` sub-queries within the WHERE clause that are correlated with the outer query.\n**Transformations**: - For `IN` Sub-queries: Replace the `IN` clause with a JOIN operation and a WHERE condition that checks for non-null values on the side of the sub-query.\n    - Original Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 WHERE column IN (SELECT column2 FROM table2 WHERE table1.join_column = table2.join_column)\n    - Transformed Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.join_column = table2.join_column WHERE table2.column2 IS NOT NULL\n  - For `EXISTS` Sub-queries: Convert the `EXISTS` condition into a JOIN operation, using WHERE to filter rows that match the JOIN condition.\n    - Original Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM table2 WHERE table1.join_column = table2.join_class)\n    - Transformed Query Structure: SELECT DISTINCT table1.* FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.join_column = table2.join_column\n  - For `UNIQUE` Sub-queries: Since `UNIQUE` requires a bit more complex handling not directly mappable to a standard JOIN, it should be considered a special case where the goal is to ensure that rows from the outer query match a unique set in the sub-query. This might not translate directly into SQL syntax without additional sub-query or DISTINCT aggregation."""\n\nArranged Rule Sequence: ["AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE", "FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE"]\n\nUtilized Rules: ["AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE", "FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE"]\n\nUnutilized Rules: []'}], 'response': 'Step 1: Since there are no unutilized rules in the provided arrangement, we don\'t need to prioritize any unutilized potential rules over the utilized ones.
