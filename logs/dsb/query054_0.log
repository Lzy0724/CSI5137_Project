When the `LIMIT` clause is used to fetch a specified number of rows.\n2. When `ORDER BY` is used in conjunction with `LIMIT` to sort and limit the number of rows retrieved, particularly when sorting can leverage an index.\n3. When `DISTINCT` is used along with `LIMIT` to quickly identify and return unique rows without scanning the full dataset.\n4. During the use of `GROUP BY`, where optimization might involve sorting or traversing indexes in order to efficiently compute group values without processing the entire dataset.\n5. When sorting a specific number of rows from a single table based on non-indexed columns, utilizing in-memory sorting (`filesort`) techniques.\n**Transformations**: The specific SQL transformations that emerge from applying these optimization rules are:\n1. Combining `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY` encourages the database engine to stop the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained, avoiding full table sorts.\n2. Using `LIMIT` with `DISTINCT` leads to an early termination of the search for unique rows as soon as the needed amount is gathered, reducing time and resources spent on scanning the entire dataset.\n3. In the context of `GROUP BY`, optimizations may include indexing strategies or modifications to the way sorting is handled, such as employing `filesort` mechanisms that do not require temporary tables, ensuring that the database engine processes only the necessary data for group computations.\n4. Efficiencies are gained by encouraging the use of indexed columns with `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT`, making queries more efficient by reducing the cost associated with sorting and filtering operations.\n"""\nRule 4:\n"""\n**Conditions**: The SQL query rewrite rule applies when a query uses `DISTINCT` to remove duplicates, especially in the presence of multiple columns and when `ORDER BY` is involved. Additionally, this rule is particularly relevant when the columns in the `DISTINCT` query are supported by indexes.\n**Transformations**: - Rewriting the query to replace `DISTINCT` with a `GROUP BY` clause on the same columns used in the `DISTINCT` operation. This can improve execution efficiency by potentially taking advantage of indexes on these columns more effectively.\n- Ensuring that indexes match the columns specified in the `DISTINCT` operations to facilitate more efficient query processing. This transformation aims to reduce the need for the creation of temporary tables and, in turn, speed up query execution.\n"""\nRule 5:\n"""\n**Conditions**: The SQL query rewrite rule applies when there are:\n- Functions or operations (especially deterministic ones) within the SELECT, WHERE, JOIN conditions, or any part of the query that is executed multiple times for the same row.\n- The presence of potentially computationally expensive operations or function calls that are not dependent on the data of the specific row and thus can be optimized.\n**Transformations**: 1. Move repeated function calls or operations outside of loops, if applicable. For example, if a function that generates a calculated value based on constants or parameters (not row-specific data) is being called in a loop, calculate the value once before the loop and store the result for reuse.\n   \n2. Replace inline functions in the SELECT or WHERE clause with a pre-calculated column if the function is deterministic and the input data does not change frequently. This might involve:\n   - Creating a temporary table that includes the results of the expensive function calls.\n   - Using a subquery or a Common Table Expression (CTE) that calculates the value once and then joins it with the main query.\n   \n3. When using aggregate functions that are called multiple times with the same parameters, consider storing the result in a variable or a temporary table, especially if the data set is large.\n\n4. Avoid using functions on indexed columns in the WHERE clause. This prevents the database from using the index efficiently. If a function must be used, consider creating a computed column that pre-calculates the function\'s result and index that column instead.\n\n5. If possible, simplify expressions and calculations to reduce their complexity and execution time. This might involve algebraic simplification or breaking down complex calculations into simpler parts that can be calculated separately and then combined.\n\nExample:\nOriginal Query:\n```sql\nSELECT id, name, expensive_function(column) as expensive_result\nFROM table\nWHERE expensive_function(column) > 100;\n```\n\nTransformed Query using a CTE:\n```sql\nWITH PreCalculated AS (\n  SELECT id, name, column, expensive_function(column) as expensive_result\n  FROM table\n)\nSELECT id, name, expensive_sel as expensive_result\nFROM PreCalculated\nWHERE expensive_result > 100;\n```\n"""\nRule 6:\n"""\n**Conditions**: The rule applies when the original SQL query performs multiple scans or joins on the same table to retrieve different attributes for certain conditions, or when the query structure results in redundant data processing and complexity that could be reduced.\n**Transformations**: - Combine multiple joins into a single join operation by using `CASE` statements to conditionally select different attributes from the table in one pass. \n- Use the `COALESCE` function in conjunction with `CASE` statements to efficiently merge conditional attributes into distinct columns based on specific criteria without the need for additional joins.\n- Optimize the selection of conditional attributes by integrating `GROUP BY` with aggregate functions like `MAX` within `CASE` statements, thus condensing the result set to only the necessary data and avoiding needless retrieval and processing steps.\n- The overall transformation leads to a single, more efficient query that accomplishes the tasks of multiple, less efficient operations, improving performance, and simplifying the query for better readability and maintenance.\n"""'}], 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'stream': False, 'temperature': 0.1}}

The filter's expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there's a matching row in the non-preserving side's table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned.\n```\n\nLogical Plan Changes After Rewrite: ```\n  LogicalSort(sort0=[$0(ss_ext_sales_price)], sort1=[$1], dir0=[ASC], dir1=[ASC], fetch=[100])\r\n    LogicalProject(segment=[$0(ss_ext_sales_price)], num_customers=[$1], segment_base=[*($0(ss_ext_sales_price), 50)])\r\n      LogicalAggregate(group=[{0}], num_customers=[COUNT()])\r\n        LogicalProject(segment=[CAST(/($1(ss_ext_sales_price), 50)):INTEGER])\r\n          LogicalAggregate(group=[{0}], revenue=[SUM($1)])\r\n            LogicalProject(c_customer_sk=[$0(c_customer_sk)], ss_ext_sales_price=[$17(ss_ext_sales_price)])\r\n-             LogicalFilter(condition=[AND(=($1(c_current_addr_sk), $25(ca_address_sk)), =($32(ca_county), $61(s_county)), =($33(ca_state), $62(s_state)), =($2(ss_sold_date_sk), $67(d_date_sk)), =($0(c_customer_sk), $5(ss_customer_sk)), >=($13(ss_wholesale_cost), 70), <=($13(ss_wholesale_cost), 100), OR(=(CAST($62(s_state)):CHAR(2), 'GA'), =(CAST($62(s_state)):CHAR(2), 'IA'), =(CAST($62(s_state)):CHAR(2), 'IL'), =(CAST($62(s_state)):CHAR(2), 'KS'), =(CAST($62(s_state)):CHAR(2), 'LA'), =(CAST($62(s_state)):CHAR(2), 'ME'), =(CAST($62(s_state)):CHAR(2), 'MI'), =(CAST($62(s_state)):CHAR(2), 'NC'), =(CAST($62(s_state)):CHAR(2), 'ND'), =(CAST($62(s_state)):CHAR(2), 'OK')), >=($70(d_month_seq), $SCALAR_QUERY({\n+             LogicalJoin(condition=[=($2(ss_sold_date_sk), $67(d_date_sk))], joinType=[inner])\r\n+               LogicalJoin(condition=[AND(=($32(ca_county), $61(s_county)), =($33(ca_state), $62(s_state)))], joinType=[inner])\r\n+                 LogicalJoin(condition=[=($1(c_current_addr_sk), $25(ca_address_sk))], joinType=[inner])\r\n+                   LogicalJoin(condition=[=($0(c_customer_sk), $5(ss_customer_sk))], joinType=[inner])\r\n+                     LogicalAggregate(group=[{0, 1}])\r\n+                       LogicalProject(c_customer_sk=[$54(c_customer_sk)], c_current_addr_sk=[$58(c_current_addr_sk)])\r\n+                         LogicalJoin(condition=[=($54(c_customer_sk), $1)], joinType=[inner])\r\n+                           LogicalJoin(condition=[=($0, $26(d_date_sk))], joinType=[inner])\r\n+                             LogicalJoin(condition=[=($2, $4(i_item_sk))], joinType=[inner])\r\n+                               LogicalFilter(condition=[SEARCH($3, Sarg[[70..100]])])\r\n+                                 LogicalUnion(all=[true])\r\n+                                   LogicalProject(sold_date_sk=[$0(cs_sold_date_sk)], customer_sk=[$3(cs_bill_customer_sk)], item_sk=[$15(cs_item_sk)], wholesale_cost=[$19(cs_wholesale_cost)])\r\n+                                     LogicalTableScan(table=[[catalog_sales]])\r\n+                                   LogicalProject(sold_date_sk=[$0(ws_sold_date_sk)], customer_sk=[$4(ws_bill_customer_sk)], item_sk=[$3(ws_item_sk)], wholesale_cost=[$19(ws_wholesale_cost)])\r\n+                                     LogicalTableScan(table=[[web_sales]])\r\n+                               LogicalFilter(condition=[AND(=(CAST($12(i_category)):CHAR(4), 'Home'), =(CAST($10(i_class)):CHAR(9), 'furniture'))])\r\n+                                 LogicalTableScan(table=[[item]])\r\n+                             LogicalFilter(condition=[AND(=($8(d_moy), 12), =($6(d_year), 1999))])\r\n+                               LogicalTableScan(table=[[date_dim]])\r\n+                           LogicalFilter(condition=[SEARCH($13(c_birth_year), Sarg[[1980..1993]])])\r\n+                             LogicalTableScan(table=[[customer]])\r\n+                     LogicalFilter(condition=[SEARCH($11(ss_wholesale_cost), Sarg[[70..100]])])\r\n+                       LogicalTableScan(table=[[store_sales]])\r\n+                   LogicalTableScan(table=[[customer_address]])\r\n+                 LogicalFilter(condition=[SEARCH(CAST($24(s_state)):CHAR(2), Sarg['GA', 'IA', 'IL', 'KS', 'LA', 'ME', 'MI', 'NC', 'ND', 'OK']:CHAR(2))])\r\n+                   LogicalTableScan(table=[[store]])\r\n+               LogicalFilter(condition=[AND(>=($3(d_month_seq), $SCALAR_QUERY({\n  LogicalAggregate(group=[{0}])\r\n    LogicalProject(EXPR$0=[+($3(d_month_seq), 1)])\r\n      LogicalFilter(condition=[AND(=($6(d_year), 1999), =($8(d_moy), 12))])\r\n        LogicalTableScan(table=[[date_dim]])\r\n- })), <=($70(d_month_seq), $SCALAR_QUERY({\n?

If this results in an empty WHERE clause, remove the WHERE clause entirely.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause simplifies to conditions that are always false or involve comparisons with NULL in a way that the outcome is always false or NULL (e.g., `column != column` or `1=0`), indicating no rows can satisfy the filter.\n**Transformations**: Replace the query with one that selects no rows. This could be represented in different ways based on the SQL dialect. One universal method might be selecting from a dual table with a false condition.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains complex conditions that can be simplified based on known constraints, constants, or through logical simplification (e.g., `column IS NOT NULL AND column IS NOT NULL` simplifies to `column IS NOT NULL`).\n**Transformations**: Simplify the conditions according to logical rules and known constraints.

The key changes include the removal of an outer projection layer and the direct application of aggregate functions and `GROUP BY` clauses to the data source. Specifically, the `LogicalAggregate` and `LogicalProject` operations have been adjusted to eliminate unnecessary layers and directly use the data from the `store_sales` table.\n\nStep 2: Parsing the logical plan changes, we observe that the `LogicalAggregate` operation now directly sums the `ss_ext_sales_price` from the `store_sales` table, bypassing the intermediate `my_revenue` CTE. The `LogicalProject` operation that previously selected `c_customer_sk` and `ss_ext_sales_price` has been removed, and the aggregation is now performed directly on the `store_sales` data. Additionally, the `LogicalJoin` operations have been streamlined, removing unnecessary joins and directly accessing the required tables.\n\nStep 3: The query rewrite rule contains two cases. Based on the parsed SQL query changes, the rewrite matches Case 2. This is because the `SELECT` clause of the outer query in the original SQL matches the columns used in the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions of the inner query (`my_revenue` CTE), and the inner `SELECT` only serves as a passthrough for these columns without any transformations or renamings.\n\nStep 4: In Case 2, the transformation involves removing the inner `SELECT` layer and directly applying the aggregate functions and `GROUP BY` to the original data source. This is evident in the logical plan changes where the `LogicalAggregate` now directly sums `ss_ext_sales_price` from `store_sales`, and the `LogicalProject` that previously selected columns from `my_revenue` has been eliminated. The `GROUP BY` operation is applied directly to the `c_customer_sk` column from `store_sales`, and the aggregation is performed without the intermediate CTE layer. This results in a more efficient query execution plan by reducing unnecessary intermediate steps.', 'time': 4.626253366470337}

You should cite the detailed changes of the given SQL query to explain this query rewrite process concisely and detailedly.\n\nOutput in the following format:\nStep 1: <step 1 reasoning>\nStep 2: <step 2 reasoning>\nStep 3: <step 3 reasoning>\nStep 4: <step 4 reasoning>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': "\nSQL Query: ```sql\nwith my_customers as (\n select distinct c_customer_sk\n        , c_current_addr_sk\n from\n        ( select cs_sold_date_sk sold_date_sk,\n                 cs_bill_customer_sk customer_sk,\n                 cs_item_sk item_sk,\n                 cs_wholesale_cost wholesale_cost\n          from   catalog_sales\n          union all\n          select ws_sold_date_sk sold_date_sk,\n                 ws_bill_customer_sk customer_sk,\n                 ws_item_sk item_sk,\n                 ws_wholesale_cost wholesale_cost\n          from   web_sales\n         ) cs_or_ws_sales,\n         item,\n         date_dim,\n         customer\n where   sold_date_sk = d_date_sk\n         and item_sk = i_item_sk\n         and i_category = 'Home'\n         and i_class = 'furniture'\n         and c_customer_sk = cs_or_ws_sales.customer_sk\n         and d_moy = 12\n         and d_year = 1999\n         and wholesale_cost BETWEEN 70 AND 100\n         and c_birth_year BETWEEN 1980 AND 1993\n )\n , my_revenue as (\n select c_customer_sk,\n        sum(ss_ext_sales_price) as revenue\n from   my_customers,\n        store_sales,\n        customer_address,\n        store,\n        date_dim\n where  c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk\n        and ca_county = s_county\n        and ca_state = s_state\n        and ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk\n        and c_customer_sk = ss_customer_sk\n        and ss_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 70 AND 100\n        and s_state in ('GA','IA','IL'\n                    ,'KS','LA','ME'\n                    ,'MI','NC','ND'\n                    ,'OK')\n        and d_month_seq between (select distinct d_month_seq+1\n                                 from   date_dim where d_year = 1999 and d_moy = 12)\n                           and  (select distinct d_month_seq+3\n                                 from   date_dim where d_year = 1999 and d_moy = 12)\n group by c_customer_sk\n )\n , segments as\n (select cast((revenue/50) as int) as segment\n  from   my_revenue\n )\n  select  segment, count(*) as num_customers, segment*50 as segment_base\n from segments\n group by segment\n order by segment, num_customers\n limit 100;\n```\n\nQuery Rewrite Rule: ```\nCase 1:\n**Conditions**: The query contains a scalar sub-query within the WHERE clause.\n**Transformations**: The scalar sub-query should be transformed into a LEFT JOIN operation with an aggregate function on the column(s) being selected in the sub-query. The JOIN condition uses the correlation ID (the matching column(s) in both outer and sub-query).\n  - Original Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 WHERE column = (SELECT AGG_FUNCTION(column2) FROM table2 WHERE table1.join_column = table2.join_column)\n  - Transformed Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 LEFT JOIN (SELECT join_column, AGG_FUNCTION(column2) AS agg_result FROM table2 GROUP BY join_column) AS sub_query ON table1.join_column = sub_query.join_column WHERE column = sub_query.agg_result\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: The query contains `IN`, `EXISTS`, or `UNIQUE` sub-queries within the WHERE clause that are correlated with the outer query.\n**Transformations**: - For `IN` Sub-queries: Replace the `IN` clause with a JOIN operation and a WHERE condition that checks for non-null values on the side of the sub-query.\n    - Original Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 WHERE column IN (SELECT column2 FROM table2 WHERE table1.join_column = table2.join_column)\n    - Transformed Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.join_column = table2.join_column WHERE table2.column2 IS NOT NULL\n  - For `EXISTS` Sub-queries: Convert the `EXISTS` condition into a JOIN operation, using WHERE to filter rows that match the JOIN condition.\n    - Original Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM table2 WHERE table1.join_column = table2.join_class)\n    - Transformed Query Structure: SELECT DISTINCT table1.* FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.join_column = table2.join_column\n  - For `UNIQUE` Sub-queries: Since `UNIQUE` requires a bit more complex handling not directly mappable to a standard JOIN, it should be considered a special case where the goal is to ensure that rows from the outer query match a unique set in the sub-query. This might not translate directly into SQL syntax without additional sub-query or DISTINCT aggregation.\n```\n\nLogical Plan Changes After Rewrite: ```\n  LogicalSort(sort0=[$0(ss_ext_sales_price)],

Specifically, the conditions involving range checks on `wholesale_cost` and `c_birth_year` have been replaced with a more efficient search argument (Sargable) form. This suggests that the query rewrite rule has optimized these conditions for better performance.\n\nStep 2: Parsing the logical plan changes, we observe the following detailed changes in the SQL query:\n- The condition `wholesale_cost BETWEEN 70 AND 100` has been transformed into `SEARCH($13(ss_wholesale_cost), Sarg[[70..100]])`.\n- The condition `c_birth_year BETWEEN 1980 AND 1993` has been transformed into `SEARCH($67(c_birth_year), Sarg[[1980..1993]])`.\n\nThese transformations indicate that the conditions have been optimized to use search arguments, which are typically more efficient for query execution.\n\nStep 3: The query rewrite rule contains multiple cases. In this scenario, the changes match Case 3 of the query rewrite rule. Case 3 involves simplifying complex conditions based on known constraints or logical simplifications. The transformation of the BETWEEN conditions into SEARCH arguments aligns with this case, as it simplifies the conditions for more efficient processing.\n\nStep 4: In Case 3, the SQL query changes involve simplifying the WHERE clause conditions by transforming range checks into search arguments. This is done to optimize the query execution by making the conditions more Sargable, which allows the database engine to use indexes more effectively. The specific changes in the SQL query are:\n- The condition `wholesale_cost BETWEEN 70 AND 100` is simplified to `SEARCH($13(ss_wholesale_cost), Sarg[[70..100]])`, which allows for more efficient range checking.\n- Similarly, `c_birth_year BETWEEN 1980 AND 1993` is simplified to `SEARCH($67(c_birth_year), Sarg[[1980..1993]])`.\n\nThese transformations reduce redundancy and unnecessary complexity in the WHERE clause, leading to potentially faster query execution by leveraging database indexing capabilities.', 'time': 4.6419970989227295}

The filter's expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there's a matching row in the non-preserving side's table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned.\n```\n\nLogical Plan Changes After Rewrite: ```\n  LogicalSort(sort0=[$0(ss_ext_sales_price)], sort1=[$1], dir0=[ASC], dir1=[ASC], fetch=[100])\r\n    LogicalProject(segment=[$0(ss_ext_sales_price)], num_customers=[$1], segment_base=[*($0(ss_ext_sales_price), 50)])\r\n      LogicalAggregate(group=[{0}], num_customers=[COUNT()])\r\n        LogicalProject(segment=[CAST(/($1(ss_ext_sales_price), 50)):INTEGER])\r\n          LogicalAggregate(group=[{0}], revenue=[SUM($1)])\r\n            LogicalProject(c_customer_sk=[$0(c_customer_sk)], ss_ext_sales_price=[$17(ss_ext_sales_price)])\r\n-             LogicalFilter(condition=[AND(=($1(c_current_addr_sk), $25(ca_address_sk)), =($32(ca_county), $61(s_county)), =($33(ca_state), $62(s_state)), =($2(ss_sold_date_sk), $67(d_date_sk)), =($0(c_customer_sk), $5(ss_customer_sk)), >=($13(ss_wholesale_cost), 70), <=($13(ss_wholesale_cost), 100), OR(=(CAST($62(s_state)):CHAR(2), 'GA'), =(CAST($62(s_state)):CHAR(2), 'IA'), =(CAST($62(s_state)):CHAR(2), 'IL'), =(CAST($62(s_state)):CHAR(2), 'KS'), =(CAST($62(s_state)):CHAR(2), 'LA'), =(CAST($62(s_state)):CHAR(2), 'ME'), =(CAST($62(s_state)):CHAR(2), 'MI'), =(CAST($62(s_state)):CHAR(2), 'NC'), =(CAST($62(s_state)):CHAR(2), 'ND'), =(CAST($62(s_state)):CHAR(2), 'OK')), >=($70(d_month_seq), $SCALAR_QUERY({\n+             LogicalJoin(condition=[=($2(ss_sold_date_sk), $67(d_date_sk))], joinType=[inner])\r\n+               LogicalJoin(condition=[AND(=($32(ca_county), $61(s_county)), =($33(ca_state), $62(s_state)))], joinType=[inner])\r\n+                 LogicalJoin(condition=[=($1(c_current_addr_sk), $25(ca_address_sk))], joinType=[inner])\r\n+                   LogicalJoin(condition=[=($0(c_customer_sk), $5(ss_customer_sk))], joinType=[inner])\r\n+                     LogicalAggregate(group=[{0, 1}])\r\n+                       LogicalProject(c_customer_sk=[$54(c_customer_sk)], c_current_addr_sk=[$58(c_current_addr_sk)])\r\n+                         LogicalJoin(condition=[=($54(c_customer_sk), $1)], joinType=[inner])\r\n+                           LogicalJoin(condition=[=($0, $26(d_date_sk))], joinType=[inner])\r\n+                             LogicalJoin(condition=[=($2, $4(i_item_sk))], joinType=[inner])\r\n+                               LogicalFilter(condition=[SEARCH($3, Sarg[[70..100]])])\r\n+                                 LogicalUnion(all=[true])\r\n+                                   LogicalProject(sold_date_sk=[$0(cs_sold_date_sk)], customer_sk=[$3(cs_bill_customer_sk)], item_sk=[$15(cs_item_sk)], wholesale_cost=[$19(cs_wholesale_cost)])\r\n+                                     LogicalTableScan(table=[[catalog_sales]])\r\n+                                   LogicalProject(sold_date_sk=[$0(ws_sold_date_sk)], customer_sk=[$4(ws_bill_customer_sk)], item_sk=[$3(ws_item_sk)], wholesale_cost=[$19(ws_wholesale_cost)])\r\n+                                     LogicalTableScan(table=[[web_sales]])\r\n+                               LogicalFilter(condition=[AND(=(CAST($12(i_category)):CHAR(4), 'Home'), =(CAST($10(i_class)):CHAR(9), 'furniture'))])\r\n+                                 LogicalTableScan(table=[[item]])\r\n+                             LogicalFilter(condition=[AND(=($8(d_moy), 12), =($6(d_year), 1999))])\r\n+                               LogicalTableScan(table=[[date_dim]])\r\n+                           LogicalFilter(condition=[SEARCH($13(c_birth_year), Sarg[[1980..1993]])])\r\n+                             LogicalTableScan(table=[[customer]])\r\n+                     LogicalFilter(condition=[SEARCH($11(ss_wholesale_cost), Sarg[[70..100]])])\r\n+                       LogicalTableScan(table=[[store_sales]])\r\n+                   LogicalTableScan(table=[[customer_address]])\r\n+                 LogicalFilter(condition=[SEARCH(CAST($24(s_state)):CHAR(2), Sarg['GA', 'IA', 'IL', 'KS', 'LA', 'ME', 'MI', 'NC', 'ND', 'OK']:CHAR(2))])\r\n+                   LogicalTableScan(table=[[store]])\r\n+               LogicalFilter(condition=[AND(>=($3(d_month_seq), $SCALAR_QUERY({\n  LogicalAggregate(group=[{0}])\r\n    LogicalProject(EXPR$0=[+($3(d_month_seq), 1)])\r\n      LogicalFilter(condition=[AND(=($6(d_year), 1999), =($8(d_moy), 12))])\r\n        LogicalTableScan(table=[[date_dim]])\r\n- })), <=($70(d_month_seq), $SCALAR_QUERY({\n?

Specifically, conditions that were previously applied after the joins in the `LogicalFilter` have been pushed down into the `LogicalJoin` conditions. This suggests that the query rewrite rule has been applied to optimize the joins by moving applicable filter conditions closer to the data source, reducing the size of intermediate datasets.\n\nStep 2: Parsing the logical plan changes, we observe the following detailed changes in the SQL query:\n- The condition `c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk` has been moved into the `ON` clause of the join between `my_customers` and `customer_address`.\n- The conditions `ca_county = s_county` and `ca_state = s_state` have been moved into the `ON` clause of the join between `customer_address` and `store`.\n- The condition `ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk` has been moved into the `ON` clause of the join between `store_sales` and `date_dim`.\n- The condition `c_customer_sk = ss_customer_sk` has been moved into the `ON` clause of the join between `my_customers` and `store_sales`.\n- The condition `ss_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 70 AND 100` has been moved into a filter directly on `store_sales`.\n- The condition `s_state in ('GA','IA','IL','KS','LA','ME','MI','NC','ND','OK')` has been moved into a filter directly on `store`.\n\nStep 3: The SQL query rewrite rule contains multiple cases. Based on the parsed SQL query changes, the matched case is Case 1. This case applies when a filter condition is placed on the result set of an INNER JOIN operation, and the filter's expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join. The transformations involve moving these conditions into the `ON` clause of the INNER JOIN.\n\nStep 4: The SQL query changes can be explained by Case 1 of the query rewrite rule. The conditions `c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk`, `ca_county = s_county`, `ca_state = s_state`, `ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk`, and `c_customer_sk = ss_customer_sk` were initially applied after the joins in the `WHERE` clause. These conditions only involve columns from one side of their respective joins and can be logically applied to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs. By moving these conditions into the `ON` clause of the INNER JOINs, the query optimizer can potentially reduce the amount of data processed in subsequent operations, leading to more efficient query execution. Additionally, the conditions `ss_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 70 AND 100` and `s_state in ('GA','IA','IL','KS','LA','ME','MI','NC','ND','OK')` were moved to filters directly on `store_sales` and `store`, respectively, further optimizing the query by reducing the data size before the join operations.", 'time': 5.421840190887451}

When the `LIMIT` clause is used to fetch a specified number of rows.\n2. When `ORDER BY` is used in conjunction with `LIMIT` to sort and limit the number of rows retrieved, particularly when sorting can leverage an index.\n3. When `DISTINCT` is used along with `LIMIT` to quickly identify and return unique rows without scanning the full dataset.\n4. During the use of `GROUP BY`, where optimization might involve sorting or traversing indexes in order to efficiently compute group values without processing the entire dataset.\n5. When sorting a specific number of rows from a single table based on non-indexed columns, utilizing in-memory sorting (`filesort`) techniques.\n**Transformations**: The specific SQL transformations that emerge from applying these optimization rules are:\n1. Combining `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY` encourages the database engine to stop the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained, avoiding full table sorts.\n2. Using `LIMIT` with `DISTINCT` leads to an early termination of the search for unique rows as soon as the needed amount is gathered, reducing time and resources spent on scanning the entire dataset.\n3. In the context of `GROUP BY`, optimizations may include indexing strategies or modifications to the way sorting is handled, such as employing `filesort` mechanisms that do not require temporary tables, ensuring that the database engine processes only the necessary data for group computations.\n4. Efficiencies are gained by encouraging the use of indexed columns with `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT`, making queries more efficient by reducing the cost associated with sorting and filtering operations.\n"""\nRule 4:\n"""\n**Conditions**: The SQL query rewrite rule applies when a query uses `DISTINCT` to remove duplicates, especially in the presence of multiple columns and when `ORDER BY` is involved. Additionally, this rule is particularly relevant when the columns in the `DISTINCT` query are supported by indexes.\n**Transformations**: - Rewriting the query to replace `DISTINCT` with a `GROUP BY` clause on the same columns used in the `DISTINCT` operation. This can improve execution efficiency by potentially taking advantage of indexes on these columns more effectively.\n- Ensuring that indexes match the columns specified in the `DISTINCT` operations to facilitate more efficient query processing. This transformation aims to reduce the need for the creation of temporary tables and, in turn, speed up query execution.\n"""\nRule 5:\n"""\n**Conditions**: The SQL query rewrite rule applies when there are:\n- Functions or operations (especially deterministic ones) within the SELECT, WHERE, JOIN conditions, or any part of the query that is executed multiple times for the same row.\n- The presence of potentially computationally expensive operations or function calls that are not dependent on the data of the specific row and thus can be optimized.\n**Transformations**: 1. Move repeated function calls or operations outside of loops, if applicable. For example, if a function that generates a calculated value based on constants or parameters (not row-specific data) is being called in a loop, calculate the value once before the loop and store the result for reuse.\n   \n2. Replace inline functions in the SELECT or WHERE clause with a pre-calculated column if the function is deterministic and the input data does not change frequently. This might involve:\n   - Creating a temporary table that includes the results of the expensive function calls.\n   - Using a subquery or a Common Table Expression (CTE) that calculates the value once and then joins it with the main query.\n   \n3. When using aggregate functions that are called multiple times with the same parameters, consider storing the result in a variable or a temporary table, especially if the data set is large.\n\n4. Avoid using functions on indexed columns in the WHERE clause. This prevents the database from using the index efficiently. If a function must be used, consider creating a computed column that pre-calculates the function\'s result and index that column instead.\n\n5. If possible, simplify expressions and calculations to reduce their complexity and execution time. This might involve algebraic simplification or breaking down complex calculations into simpler parts that can be calculated separately and then combined.\n\nExample:\nOriginal Query:\n```sql\nSELECT id, name, expensive_function(column) as expensive_result\nFROM table\nWHERE expensive_function(column) > 100;\n```\n\nTransformed Query using a CTE:\n```sql\nWITH PreCalculated AS (\n  SELECT id, name, column, expensive_function(column) as expensive_result\n  FROM table\n)\nSELECT id, name, expensive_sel as expensive_result\nFROM PreCalculated\nWHERE expensive_result > 100;\n```\n"""\nRule 6:\n"""\n**Conditions**: The rule applies when the original SQL query performs multiple scans or joins on the same table to retrieve different attributes for certain conditions, or when the query structure results in redundant data processing and complexity that could be reduced.\n**Transformations**: - Combine multiple joins into a single join operation by using `CASE` statements to conditionally select different attributes from the table in one pass. \n- Use the `COALESCE` function in conjunction with `CASE` statements to efficiently merge conditional attributes into distinct columns based on specific criteria without the need for additional joins.\n- Optimize the selection of conditional attributes by integrating `GROUP BY` with aggregate functions like `MAX` within `CASE` statements, thus condensing the result set to only the necessary data and avoiding needless retrieval and processing steps.\n- The overall transformation leads to a single, more efficient query that accomplishes the tasks of multiple, less efficient operations, improving performance, and simplifying the query for better readability and maintenance.\n"""'}], 'response': 'Step 1: Analyze the given SQL query against each provided rewrite rule\'s conditions to determine applicability.\n\n- **Rule 1**: The query does not use NOT EXISTS, NOT IN, EXISTS, IN, or OR within JOINs and WHERE clauses.

This rule is applicable as it suggests performing `GROUP BY` operations earlier to reduce intermediate dataset sizes, which could enhance performance.\n\n- **Rule 3**: The query uses `LIMIT` and `ORDER BY` in the final selection, which matches the conditions of Rule 3. This rule can be applied to optimize the sorting and limiting process.\n\n- **Rule 4**: The query uses `DISTINCT` in the `my_customers` CTE. This rule is applicable as it suggests replacing `DISTINCT` with `GROUP BY` to potentially improve execution efficiency.\n\n- **Rule 5**: The query does not contain repeated function calls or operations that are computationally expensive and executed multiple times for the same row. Therefore, Rule 5 does not match the SQL query.\n\n- **Rule 6**: The query does not perform multiple scans or joins on the same table to retrieve different attributes for certain conditions. Therefore, Rule 6 does not match the SQL query.\n\nStep 2: Apply the transformations of the matched rules to the SQL query.\n\nQuery Rewrite 2:\n"""\nThe query performs `GROUP BY` operations in the `my_revenue` CTE after joining multiple tables. According to Rule 2, we can optimize the query by performing `GROUP BY` operations earlier to reduce the size of intermediate datasets. Specifically, we can pre-aggregate the `store_sales` data before joining with other tables. This involves creating a subquery or CTE that groups `store_sales` by `ss_customer_sk` and calculates the sum of `ss_ext_sales_price` and then joining this pre-aggregated result with `my_customers`, `customer_address`, `store`, and `date_dim`. This reduces the amount of data processed in subsequent joins, potentially improving performance.\n"""\n\nQuery Rewrite 3:\n"""\nThe query uses `LIMIT` and `ORDER BY` in the final selection. Rule 3 suggests that combining `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY` encourages the database engine to stop the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained, avoiding full table sorts. This transformation does not require a structural change to the query but highlights the importance of ensuring that the `ORDER BY` columns are indexed to leverage this optimization effectively. If the `segment` column is indexed, the database can efficiently sort and limit the results, improving query performance.\n"""\n\nQuery Rewrite 4:\n"""\nThe `my_customers` CTE uses `DISTINCT` to remove duplicates based on `c_customer_sk` and `c_current_addr_sk`. Rule 4 suggests replacing `DISTINCT` with a `GROUP BY` clause on the same columns.

The rewritten CTE would look like this:\n\n```sql\nwith my_customers as (\n select c_customer_sk, c_current_addr_sk\n from\n        ( select cs_sold_date_sk sold_date_sk,\n                 cs_bill_customer_sk customer_sk,\n                 cs_item_sk item_sk,\n                 cs_wholesale_cost wholesale_cost\n          from   catalog_sales\n          union all\n          select ws_sold_date_sk sold_date_sk,\n                 ws_bill_customer_sk customer_sk,\n                 ws_item_sk item_sk,\n                 ws_wholesale_cost wholesale_cost\n          from   web_sales\n         ) cs_or_ws_sales,\n         item,\n         date_dim,\n         customer\n where   sold_date_sk = d_date_sk\n         and item_sk = i_item_sk\n         and i_category = \'Home\'\n         and i_class = \'furniture\'\n         and c_customer_sk = cs_or_ws_sales.customer_sk\n         and d_moy = 12\n         and d_year = 1999\n         and wholesale_cost BETWEEN 70 AND 100\n         and c_birth_year BETWEEN 1980 AND 1993\n group by c_customer_sk, c_current_addr_sk\n )\n```\nThis change may improve performance by utilizing any existing indexes on `c_customer_sk` and `c_current_addr_sk`.\n"""', 'time': 6.976745367050171}

clause into LEFT JOIN operations. Specifically, the scalar sub-queries that calculate `d_month_seq+1` and `d_month_seq+3` have been replaced by LEFT JOINs with aggregate functions.\n\nStep 2: Parsing the logical plan changes, we observe the following detailed changes in the SQL query:\n- The original scalar sub-queries `(select distinct d_month_seq+1 from date_dim where d_year = 1999 and d_moy = 12)` and `(select distinct d_month_seq+3 from date_dim where d_year = 1999 and d_moy = 12)` have been replaced by LEFT JOIN operations.\n- The LEFT JOINs involve aggregate functions (`SINGLE_VALUE`) on the `d_month_seq` column from the `date_dim` table, grouped by the `d_month_seq` column.\n- The JOIN condition uses the `d_month_seq` column as the correlation ID.\n\nStep 3: The SQL query rewrite rule contains two cases. The changes in the SQL query match Case 1, where scalar sub-queries within the WHERE clause are transformed into LEFT JOIN operations with aggregate functions. The transformation involves the `d_month_seq` column from the `date_dim` table, which is consistent with the conditions and transformations described in Case 1.\n\nStep 4: The query rewrite process involves transforming the scalar sub-queries `(select distinct d_month_seq+1 from date_dim where d_year = 1999 and d_moy = 12)` and `(select distinct d_month_seq+3 from date_dim where d_year = 1999 and d_moy = 12)` into LEFT JOIN operations. These sub-queries are replaced by LEFT JOINs with aggregate functions (`SINGLE_VALUE`) on the `d_month_seq` column, grouped by `d_month_seq`. The JOIN condition uses `d_month_seq` as the correlation ID, ensuring that the outer query can access the aggregated results directly. This transformation optimizes the query by eliminating scalar sub-queries and leveraging JOIN operations for better performance.', 'time': 4.975080728530884}
05:36:20,856 root INFO Generated queries:
Query 1: The SQL query changes can be explained by Case 1 of the query rewrite rule. The conditions `c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk`, `ca_county = s_county`, `ca_state = s_state`, `ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk`, and `c_customer_sk = ss_customer_sk` were initially applied after the joins in the `WHERE` clause. These conditions only involve columns from one side of their respective joins and can be logically applied to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs. By moving these conditions into the `ON` clause of the INNER JOINs, the query optimizer can potentially reduce the amount of data processed in subsequent operations, leading to more efficient query execution. Additionally, the conditions `ss_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 70 AND 100` and `s_state in ('GA','IA','IL','KS','LA','ME','MI','NC','ND','OK')` were moved to filters directly on `store_sales` and `store`, respectively, further optimizing the query by reducing the data size before the join operations.
Query 2: In Case 2, the transformation involves removing the inner `SELECT` layer and directly applying the aggregate functions and `GROUP BY` to the original data source. This is evident in the logical plan changes where the `LogicalAggregate` now directly sums `ss_ext_sales_price` from `store_sales`, and the `LogicalProject` that previously selected columns from `my_revenue` has been eliminated. The `GROUP BY` operation is applied directly to the `c_customer_sk` column from `store_sales`, and the aggregation is performed without the intermediate CTE layer. This results in a more efficient query execution plan by reducing unnecessary intermediate steps.
Query 3: In Case 3, the SQL query changes involve simplifying the WHERE clause conditions by transforming range checks into search arguments. This is done to optimize the query execution by making the conditions more Sargable, which allows the database engine to use indexes more effectively. The specific changes in the SQL query are:
- The condition `wholesale_cost BETWEEN 70 AND 100` is simplified to `SEARCH($13(ss_wholesale_cost), Sarg[[70..100]])`, which allows for more efficient range checking.
- Similarly, `c_birth_year BETWEEN 1980 AND 1993` is simplified to `SEARCH($67(c_birth_year), Sarg[[1980..1993]])`.

These transformations reduce redundancy and unnecessary complexity in the WHERE clause, leading to potentially faster query execution by leveraging database indexing capabilities.
Query 4: The query rewrite process involves transforming the scalar sub-queries `(select distinct d_month_seq+1 from date_dim where d_year = 1999 and d_moy = 12)` and `(select distinct d_month_seq+3 from date_dim where d_year = 1999 and d_moy = 12)` into LEFT JOIN operations. These sub-queries are replaced by LEFT JOINs with aggregate functions (`SINGLE_VALUE`) on the `d_month_seq` column, grouped by `d_month_seq`. The JOIN condition uses `d_month_seq` as the correlation ID, ensuring that the outer query can access the aggregated results directly. This transformation optimizes the query by eliminating scalar sub-queries and leveraging JOIN operations for better performance.
Query 5: The query performs `GROUP BY` operations in the `my_revenue` CTE after joining multiple tables. According to Rule 2, we can optimize the query by performing `GROUP BY` operations earlier to reduce the size of intermediate datasets. Specifically, we can pre-aggregate the `store_sales` data before joining with other tables. This involves creating a subquery or CTE that groups `store_sales` by `ss_customer_sk` and calculates the sum of `ss_ext_sales_price` and then joining this pre-aggregated result with `my_customers`, `customer_address`, `store`, and `date_dim`. This reduces the amount of data processed in subsequent joins, potentially improving performance.
Query 6: The query uses `LIMIT` and `ORDER BY` in the final selection. Rule 3 suggests that combining `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY` encourages the database engine to stop the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained, avoiding full table sorts. This transformation does not require a structural change to the query but highlights the importance of ensuring that the `ORDER BY` columns are indexed to leverage this optimization effectively. If the `segment` column is indexed, the database can efficiently sort and limit the results, improving query performance.
Query 7: The `my_customers` CTE uses `DISTINCT` to remove duplicates based on `c_customer_sk` and `c_current_addr_sk`. Rule 4 suggests replacing `DISTINCT` with a `GROUP BY` clause on the same columns. This transformation can improve execution efficiency by potentially taking advantage of indexes on these columns more effectively. The rewritten CTE would look like this:

```sql
with my_customers as (
 select c_customer_sk, c_current_addr_sk
 from
        ( select cs_sold_date_sk sold_date_sk,
                 cs_bill_customer_sk customer_sk,
                 cs_item_sk item_sk,
                 cs_wholesale_cost wholesale_cost
          from   catalog_sales
          union all
          select ws_sold_date_sk sold_date_sk,
                 ws_bill_customer_sk customer_sk,
                 ws_item_sk item_sk,
                 ws_wholesale_cost wholesale_cost
          from   web_sales
         ) cs_or_ws_sales,
         item,
         date_dim,
         customer
 where   sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
         and item_sk = i_item_sk
         and i_category = 'Home'
         and i_class = 'furniture'
         and c_customer_sk = cs_or_ws_sales.customer_sk
         and d_moy = 12
         and d_year = 1999
         and wholesale_cost BETWEEN 70 AND 100
         and c_birth_year BETWEEN 1980 AND 1993
 group by c_customer_sk, c_current_addr_sk
 )
```

"""The SQL query changes can be explained by Case 1 of the query rewrite rule. The conditions `c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk`, `ca_county = s_county`, `ca_state = s_state`, `ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk`, and `c_customer_sk = ss_customer_sk` were initially applied after the joins in the `WHERE` clause. These conditions only involve columns from one side of their respective joins and can be logically applied to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs. By moving these conditions into the `ON` clause of the INNER JOINs, the query optimizer can potentially reduce the amount of data processed in subsequent operations, leading to more efficient query execution. Additionally, the conditions `ss_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 70 AND 100` and `s_state in ('GA','IA','IL','KS','LA','ME','MI','NC','ND','OK')` were moved to filters directly on `store_sales` and `store`, respectively, further optimizing the query by reducing the data size before the join operations."""

Query Rewrite 2:
"""In Case 2, the transformation involves removing the inner `SELECT` layer and directly applying the aggregate functions and `GROUP BY` to the original data source. This is evident in the logical plan changes where the `LogicalAggregate` now directly sums `ss_ext_sales_price` from `store_sales`, and the `LogicalProject` that previously selected columns from `my_revenue` has been eliminated. The `GROUP BY` operation is applied directly to the `c_customer_sk` column from `store_sales`, and the aggregation is performed without the intermediate CTE layer. This results in a more efficient query execution plan by reducing unnecessary intermediate steps."""

Query Rewrite 3:
"""In Case 3, the SQL query changes involve simplifying the WHERE clause conditions by transforming range checks into search arguments. This is done to optimize the query execution by making the conditions more Sargable, which allows the database engine to use indexes more effectively. The specific changes in the SQL query are:
- The condition `wholesale_cost BETWEEN 70 AND 100` is simplified to `SEARCH($13(ss_wholesale_cost), Sarg[[70..100]])`, which allows for more efficient range checking.
- Similarly, `c_birth_year BETWEEN 1980 AND 1993` is simplified to `SEARCH($67(c_birth_year), Sarg[[1980..1993]])`.

These transformations reduce redundancy and unnecessary complexity in the WHERE clause, leading to potentially faster query execution by leveraging database indexing capabilities."""

Query Rewrite 4:
"""The query rewrite process involves transforming the scalar sub-queries `(select distinct d_month_seq+1 from date_dim where d_year = 1999 and d_moy = 12)` and `(select distinct d_month_seq+3 from date_dim where d_year = 1999 and d_moy = 12)` into LEFT JOIN operations. These sub-queries are replaced by LEFT JOINs with aggregate functions (`SINGLE_VALUE`) on the `d_month_seq` column, grouped by `d_month_seq`. The JOIN condition uses `d_month_seq` as the correlation ID, ensuring that the outer query can access the aggregated results directly. This transformation optimizes the query by eliminating scalar sub-queries and leveraging JOIN operations for better performance."""

Query Rewrite 5:
"""The query performs `GROUP BY` operations in the `my_revenue` CTE after joining multiple tables. According to Rule 2, we can optimize the query by performing `GROUP BY` operations earlier to reduce the size of intermediate datasets. Specifically, we can pre-aggregate the `store_sales` data before joining with other tables. This involves creating a subquery or CTE that groups `store_sales` by `ss_customer_sk` and calculates the sum of `ss_ext_sales_price` and then joining this pre-aggregated result with `my_customers`, `customer_address`, `store`, and `date_dim`. This reduces the amount of data processed in subsequent joins, potentially improving performance."""

Query Rewrite 6:
"""The query uses `LIMIT` and `ORDER BY` in the final selection. Rule 3 suggests that combining `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY` encourages the database engine to stop the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained, avoiding full table sorts. This transformation does not require a structural change to the query but highlights the importance of ensuring that the `ORDER BY` columns are indexed to leverage this optimization effectively. If the `segment` column is indexed, the database can efficiently sort and limit the results, improving query performance."""

Query Rewrite 7:
"""The `my_customers` CTE uses `DISTINCT` to remove duplicates based on `c_customer_sk` and `c_current_addr_sk`. Rule 4 suggests replacing `DISTINCT` with a `GROUP BY` clause on the same columns. This transformation can improve execution efficiency by potentially taking advantage of indexes on these columns more effectively. The rewritten CTE would look like this:

```sql

 select c_customer_sk, c_current_addr_sk

                 ws_wholesale_cost wholesale_cost

         ) cs_or_ws_sales,
         item,
         date_dim,
         customer

         and item_sk = i_item_sk
         and i_category = 'Home'
         and i_class = 'furniture'
         and c_customer_sk = cs_or_ws_sales.customer_sk
         and d_moy = 12
         and d_year = 1999
         and wholesale_cost BETWEEN 70 AND 100
         and c_birth_year BETWEEN 1980 AND 1993
 group by c_customer_sk, c_current_addr_sk

This change may improve performance by utilizing any existing indexes on `c_customer_sk` and `c_current_addr_sk`."""

The conditions `c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk`, `ca_county = s_county`, `ca_state = s_state`, `ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk`, and `c_customer_sk = ss_customer_sk` were initially applied after the joins in the `WHERE` clause. These conditions only involve columns from one side of their respective joins and can be logically applied to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs. By moving these conditions into the `ON` clause of the INNER JOINs, the query optimizer can potentially reduce the amount of data processed in subsequent operations, leading to more efficient query execution. Additionally, the conditions `ss_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 70 AND 100` and `s_state in (\'GA\',\'IA\',\'IL\',\'KS\',\'LA\',\'ME\',\'MI\',\'NC\',\'ND\',\'OK\')` were moved to filters directly on `store_sales` and `store`, respectively, further optimizing the query by reducing the data size before the join operations."""\n\nQuery Rewrite 2:\n"""In Case 2, the transformation involves removing the inner `SELECT` layer and directly applying the aggregate functions and `GROUP BY` to the original data source. This is evident in the logical plan changes where the `LogicalAggregate` now directly sums `ss_ext_sales_price` from `store_sales`, and the `LogicalProject` that previously selected columns from `my_revenue` has been eliminated. The `GROUP BY` operation is applied directly to the `c_customer_sk` column from `store_sales`, and the aggregation is performed without the intermediate CTE layer. This results in a more efficient query execution plan by reducing unnecessary intermediate steps."""\n\nQuery Rewrite 3:\n"""In Case 3, the SQL query changes involve simplifying the WHERE clause conditions by transforming range checks into search arguments. This is done to optimize the query execution by making the conditions more Sargable, which allows the database engine to use indexes more effectively. The specific changes in the SQL query are:\n- The condition `wholesale_cost BETWEEN 70 AND 100` is simplified to `SEARCH($13(ss_wholesale_cost), Sarg[[70..100]])`, which allows for more efficient range checking.\n- Similarly, `c_birth_year BETWEEN 1980 AND 1993` is simplified to `SEARCH($67(c_birth_year), Sarg[[1980..1993]])`.\n\nThese transformations reduce redundancy and unnecessary complexity in the WHERE clause, leading to potentially faster query execution by leveraging database indexing capabilities."""\n\nQuery Rewrite 4:\n"""The query rewrite process involves transforming the scalar sub-queries `(select distinct d_month_seq+1 from date_dim where d_year = 1999 and d_moy = 12)` and `(select distinct d_month_seq+3 from date_dim where d_year = 1999 and d_moy = 12)` into LEFT JOIN operations. These sub-queries are replaced by LEFT JOINs with aggregate functions (`SINGLE_VALUE`) on the `d_month_seq` column, grouped by `d_month_seq`. The JOIN condition uses `d_month_seq` as the correlation ID, ensuring that the outer query can access the aggregated results directly. This transformation optimizes the query by eliminating scalar sub-queries and leveraging JOIN operations for better performance."""\n\nQuery Rewrite 5:\n"""The query performs `GROUP BY` operations in the `my_revenue` CTE after joining multiple tables. According to Rule 2, we can optimize the query by performing `GROUP BY` operations earlier to reduce the size of intermediate datasets. Specifically, we can pre-aggregate the `store_sales` data before joining with other tables. This involves creating a subquery or CTE that groups `store_sales` by `ss_customer_sk` and calculates the sum of `ss_ext_sales_price` and then joining this pre-aggregated result with `my_customers`, `customer_address`, `store`, and `date_dim`. This reduces the amount of data processed in subsequent joins, potentially improving performance."""\n\nQuery Rewrite 6:\n"""The query uses `LIMIT` and `ORDER BY` in the final selection. Rule 3 suggests that combining `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY` encourages the database engine to stop the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained, avoiding full table sorts. This transformation does not require a structural change to the query but highlights the importance of ensuring that the `ORDER BY` columns are indexed to leverage this optimization effectively. If the `segment` column is indexed, the database can efficiently sort and limit the results, improving query performance."""\n\nQuery Rewrite 7:\n"""The `my_customers` CTE uses `DISTINCT` to remove duplicates based on `c_customer_sk` and `c_current_addr_sk`.

These conditions only involve columns from one side of their respective joins and can be logically applied to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs. By moving these conditions into the `ON` clause of the INNER JOINs, the query optimizer can potentially reduce the amount of data processed in subsequent operations, leading to more efficient query execution.

The specific changes in the SQL query are:\n- The condition `wholesale_cost BETWEEN 70 AND 100` is simplified to `SEARCH($13(ss_wholesale_cost), Sarg[[70..100]])`, which allows for more efficient range checking.\n- Similarly, `c_birth_year BETWEEN 1980 AND 1993` is simplified to `SEARCH($67(c_birth_year), Sarg[[1980..1993]])`.\n\nThese transformations reduce redundancy and unnecessary complexity in the WHERE clause, leading to potentially faster query execution by leveraging database indexing capabilities."""\n\nQuery Rewrite 4:\n"""The query rewrite process involves transforming the scalar sub-queries `(select distinct d_month_seq+1 from date_dim where d_year = 1999 and d_moy = 12)` and `(select distinct d_month_seq+3 from date_dim where d_year = 1999 and d_moy = 12)` into LEFT JOIN operations. These sub-queries are replaced by LEFT JOINs with aggregate functions (`SINGLE_VALUE`) on the `d_month_seq` column, grouped by `d_month_seq`.

The conditions `c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk`, `ca_county = s_county`, `ca_state = s_state`, `ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk`, and `c_customer_sk = ss_customer_sk` were initially applied after the joins in the `WHERE` clause. These conditions only involve columns from one side of their respective joins and can be logically applied to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs. By moving these conditions into the `ON` clause of the INNER JOINs, the query optimizer can potentially reduce the amount of data processed in subsequent operations, leading to more efficient query execution. Additionally, the conditions `ss_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 70 AND 100` and `s_state in (\'GA\',\'IA\',\'IL\',\'KS\',\'LA\',\'ME\',\'MI\',\'NC\',\'ND\',\'OK\')` were moved to filters directly on `store_sales` and `store`, respectively, further optimizing the query by reducing the data size before the join operations."""\n\nQuery Rewrite 2:\n"""In Case 2, the transformation involves removing the inner `SELECT` layer and directly applying the aggregate functions and `GROUP BY` to the original data source. This is evident in the logical plan changes where the `LogicalAggregate` now directly sums `ss_ext_sales_price` from `store_sales`, and the `LogicalProject` that previously selected columns from `my_revenue` has been eliminated. The `GROUP BY` operation is applied directly to the `c_customer_sk` column from `store_sales`, and the aggregation is performed without the intermediate CTE layer. This results in a more efficient query execution plan by reducing unnecessary intermediate steps."""\n\nQuery Rewrite 3:\n"""In Case 3, the SQL query changes involve simplifying the WHERE clause conditions by transforming range checks into search arguments. This is done to optimize the query execution by making the conditions more Sargable, which allows the database engine to use indexes more effectively. The specific changes in the SQL query are:\n- The condition `wholesale_cost BETWEEN 70 AND 100` is simplified to `SEARCH($13(ss_wholesale_cost), Sarg[[70..100]])`, which allows for more efficient range checking.\n- Similarly, `c_birth_year BETWEEN 1980 AND 1993` is simplified to `SEARCH($67(c_birth_year), Sarg[[1980..1993]])`.\n\nThese transformations reduce redundancy and unnecessary complexity in the WHERE clause, leading to potentially faster query execution by leveraging database indexing capabilities."""\n\nQuery Rewrite 4:\n"""The query rewrite process involves transforming the scalar sub-queries `(select distinct d_month_seq+1 from date_dim where d_year = 1999 and d_moy = 12)` and `(select distinct d_month_seq+3 from date_dim where d_year = 1999 and d_moy = 12)` into LEFT JOIN operations. These sub-queries are replaced by LEFT JOINs with aggregate functions (`SINGLE_VALUE`) on the `d_month_seq` column, grouped by `d_month_seq`. The JOIN condition uses `d_month_seq` as the correlation ID, ensuring that the outer query can access the aggregated results directly. This transformation optimizes the query by eliminating scalar sub-queries and leveraging JOIN operations for better performance."""\n\nQuery Rewrite 5:\n"""The query performs `GROUP BY` operations in the `my_revenue` CTE after joining multiple tables. According to Rule 2, we can optimize the query by performing `GROUP BY` operations earlier to reduce the size of intermediate datasets. Specifically, we can pre-aggregate the `store_sales` data before joining with other tables. This involves creating a subquery or CTE that groups `store_sales` by `ss_customer_sk` and calculates the sum of `ss_ext_sales_price` and then joining this pre-aggregated result with `my_customers`, `customer_address`, `store`, and `date_dim`. This reduces the amount of data processed in subsequent joins, potentially improving performance."""\n\nQuery Rewrite 6:\n"""The query uses `LIMIT` and `ORDER BY` in the final selection. Rule 3 suggests that combining `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY` encourages the database engine to stop the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained, avoiding full table sorts. This transformation does not require a structural change to the query but highlights the importance of ensuring that the `ORDER BY` columns are indexed to leverage this optimization effectively. If the `segment` column is indexed, the database can efficiently sort and limit the results, improving query performance."""\n\nQuery Rewrite 7:\n"""The `my_customers` CTE uses `DISTINCT` to remove duplicates based on `c_customer_sk` and `c_current_addr_sk`. Rule 4 suggests replacing `DISTINCT` with a `GROUP BY` clause on the same columns. This transformation can improve execution efficiency by potentially taking advantage of indexes on these columns more effectively. The rewritten CTE would look like this:\n\n```sql\nwith my_customers as (\n select c_customer_sk, c_current_addr_sk\n from\n        ( select cs_sold_date_sk sold_date_sk,\n                 cs_bill_customer_sk customer_sk,\n                 cs_item_sk item_sk,\n                 cs_wholesale_cost wholesale_cost\n          from   catalog_sales\n          union all\n          select ws_sold_date_sk sold_date_sk,\n                 ws_bill_customer_sk customer_sk,\n                 ws_item_sk item_sk,\n                 ws_wholesale_cost wholesale_cost\n          from   web_sales\n         ) cs_or_ws_sales,\n         item,\n         date_dim,\n         customer\n where   sold_date_sk = d_date_sk\n         and item_sk = i_item_sk\n         and i_category = \'Home\'\n         and i_class = \'furniture\'\n         and c_customer_sk = cs_or_ws_sales.customer_sk\n         and d_moy = 12\n         and d_year = 1999\n         and wholesale_cost BETWEEN 70 AND 100\n         and c_birth_year BETWEEN 1980 AND 1993\n group by c_customer_sk, c_current_addr_sk\n )\n```\nThis change may improve performance by utilizing any existing indexes on `c_customer_sk` and `c_current_addr_sk`."""'}], 'response': 'The provided SQL query can be optimized using several rewrite strategies.

The filter's expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN.

Firstly, conditions that only involve columns from one side of their respective joins can be moved from the `WHERE` clause to the `ON` clause of INNER JOINs, reducing data size before joins and enhancing efficiency. Secondly, removing intermediate CTE layers and directly applying aggregate functions and `GROUP BY` operations to the original data source can streamline the execution plan. Simplifying range checks into search arguments makes conditions more Sargable, allowing better use of indexes. Scalar sub-queries can be transformed into LEFT JOIN operations with aggregate functions, eliminating unnecessary sub-queries and improving performance. Pre-aggregating data before joining with other tables can reduce intermediate dataset sizes, enhancing query efficiency. Combining `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY` can optimize sorting by stopping once the required rows are obtained, especially if the `ORDER BY` columns are indexed. Lastly, replacing `DISTINCT` with `GROUP BY` in the `my_customers` CTE can leverage indexes more effectively, potentially improving execution efficiency. These strategies collectively aim to reduce data processing, leverage indexing, and streamline query execution for better performance."""\n\nQuery Rewrite Rules:\n### Rule FILTER_INTO_JOIN:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: This SQL query rewrite rule applies when a filter condition is placed on the result set of an INNER JOIN operation. The filter\'s expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there\'s a matching row in the non-preserving side\'s table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned."""\n\n### Rule AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: - The SQL query contains a `GROUP BY` clause that groups by simple columns (no expressions in the `GROUP BY` list).\n- The aggregate functions in the `SELECT` clause operate directly on columns (no expressions inside the aggregate functions).\n- The `SELECT` clause only contains the columns used in the `GROUP BY` clause and the aggregates without any transformations or additional expressions.\n**Transformations**: - Directly apply the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions to the data source referred to in the `FROM` clause of the inner query before the projection.\n- Eliminate the outer projection layer if it only renames the columns without transforming them.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: - The `SELECT` clause of an outer query precisely matches the columns used in the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions of an inner query, without any column transformations or renamings.\n- The inner `SELECT` only serves as a passthrough for these columns.\n**Transformations**: - Remove the inner `SELECT` layer, directly applying the aggregate functions and `GROUP BY` to the original data source."""\n\n### Rule FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains conditions that can be statically determined as always true (e.g., constant expressions like `1=1` or tautologies based on the column data types and constraints), then these conditions don\'t affect the result set.\n**Transformations**: Remove such conditions from the WHERE clause. If this results in an empty WHERE clause, remove the WHERE clause entirely.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause simplifies to conditions that are always false or involve comparisons with NULL in a way that the outcome is always false or NULL (e.g., `column != column` or `1=0`), indicating no rows can satisfy the filter.\n**Transformations**: Replace the query with one that selects no rows. This could be represented in different ways based on the SQL dialect. One universal method might be selecting from a dual table with a false condition.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains complex conditions that can be simplified based on known constraints, constants, or through logical simplification (e.g., `column IS NOT NULL AND column IS NOT NULL` simplifies to `column IS NOT NULL`).\n**Transformations**: Simplify the conditions according to logical rules and known constraints. Remove redundancy and unnecessary complexity."""\n\n### Rule FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: The query contains a scalar sub-query within the WHERE clause.\n**Transformations**: The scalar sub-query should be transformed into a LEFT JOIN operation with an aggregate function on the column(s) being selected in the sub-query. The JOIN condition uses the correlation ID (the matching column(s) in both outer and sub-query).\n  - Original Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 WHERE column = (SELECT AGG_FUNCTION(column2) FROM table2 WHERE table1.join_column = table2.join_column)\n  - Transformed Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 LEFT JOIN (SELECT join_column, AGG_FUNCTION(column2) AS agg_result FROM table2 GROUP BY join_column) AS sub_query ON table1.join_column = sub_query.join_column WHERE column = sub_query.agg_result\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: The query contains `IN`, `EXISTS`, or `UNIQUE` sub-queries within the WHERE clause that are correlated with the outer query.\n**Transformations**: - For `IN` Sub-queries: Replace the `IN` clause with a JOIN operation and a WHERE condition that checks for non-null values on the side of the sub-query.\n    - Original Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 WHERE column IN (SELECT column2 FROM table2 WHERE table1.join_column = table2.join_column)\n    - Transformed Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.join_column = table2.join_column WHERE table2.column2 IS NOT NULL\n  - For `EXISTS` Sub-queries: Convert the `EXISTS` condition into a JOIN operation, using WHERE to filter rows that match the JOIN condition.\n    - Original Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM table2 WHERE table1.join_column = table2.join_class)\n    - Transformed Query Structure: SELECT DISTINCT table1.* FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.join_column = table2.join_column\n  - For `UNIQUE` Sub-queries: Since `UNIQUE` requires a bit more complex handling not directly mappable to a standard JOIN, it should be considered a special case where the goal is to ensure that rows from the outer query match a unique set in the sub-query. This might not translate directly into SQL syntax without additional sub-query or DISTINCT aggregation."""\n\n### Rule SORT_PROJECT_TRANSPOSE:\n"""**Conditions**: If a SQL query executes a sort operation on columns that are directly referenced in the SELECT list or through expressions that are strictly monotonic transformations of these columns, and the sort operation directly follows these projections (SELECT statements), the sort operation can be pushed to operate directly on the table (FROM clause) before the projection.\n**Transformations**: 1. Check Compatibility: Ensure both sort and project (SELECT and ORDER BY clauses) involve compatible operations that relate directly to the raw column data or involve monotonic transformations.\n2. Analyze Order By Fields: Verify that each column in the ORDER BY clause is directly represented in the SELECT list or is a derived column through a monotonic transformation (e.g., casting integers to floats where the order is preserved).\n3. Adjust SQL Query: Rewrite the query so that sorting (ORDER BY clause) is applied to the raw table data in the FROM clause rather than after the projection. This might involve introducing a subquery or CTE (Common Table Expression) where the sorting is applied first, followed by the projections.\n4. Optimize Projection: Ensure that the SELECT list in the outer query matches the original projection, applying on top of the sorted data now."""\n\n### Rule PROJECT_FILTER_TRANSPOSE:\n"""**Conditions**: This rewrite rule can be applied when an SQL query contains a SELECT operation (acting as the `Project` operation) followed by a WHERE clause (acting as the `Filter` operation), provided that the SELECT does not contain window functions (such as RANK(), ROW_NUMBER(), etc.) and the columns selected do not affect the outcome of the WHERE clause.\n**Transformations**: To apply the rule, refactor the SQL query so that the conditions in the WHERE clause are evaluated before the columns are selected in the SELECT clause. This may involve moving computations or column transformations from the SELECT clause to a sub-query that the WHERE clause is applied on, ensuring the final SELECT clause on the outermost query matches the original query\'s expected outcome. - Before: SELECT col1, transformation_function(col2) FROM table WHERE condition; - After: SELECT col1, transformation_function(col2) FROM (SELECT col1, col2 FROM table WHERE condition) AS subquery;"""\n\n### Rule AGGREGATE_REDUCE_FUNCTIONS:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: any SELECT statement or subquery using the AVG aggregate function\n**Transformations**: AVG(x) as SUM(x) / COUNT(x)\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: computing the population standard deviation\n**Transformations**: STDDEV_POP(x) as the square root of (`SUM(x^2) - SUM(x)^2 / COUNT(x)`) / COUNT(x)\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: for the sample standard deviation computation\n**Transformations**: STDDEV_SAMP(x) as the square root of (`SUM(x^2) - SUM(x)^2 / COUNT(x)`) / (COUNT(x) - 1)\nCase 4:\n**Conditions**: for the population variance computation\n**Transformations**: VAR_POP(x) as (`SUM(x^2) - SUM(x)^2 / COUNT(x)`) / COUNT(x)\nCase 5:\n**Conditions**: for the sample variance computation\n**Transformations**: VAR_SAMP(x) as (`SUM(x^2) - SUM(x)^2 / COUNT(x)`) / (COUNT(x) - 1)\nCase 6:\n**Conditions**: to compute population covariance\n**Transformations**: COVAR_POP(x, y) by applying a formula involving SUM and COUNT\nCase 7:\n**Conditions**: using a formula for sample covariance\n**Transformations**: COVAR_SAMP(x, y) using a formula involving SUM, COUNT, and an adjustment for sample calculations\nCase 8:\n**Conditions**: for transforming REGR_SXX(x, y) and REGR_SYY(x, y)\n**Transformations**: into expressions involving the computation of VAR_POP(x) or VAR_POP(y) respectively, multiplied by REGR_COUNT(x, y)"""\n\n### Rule JOIN_TO_CORRELATE:\n"""**Conditions**: The join type is either INNER JOIN or LEFT JOIN. There are no requirements in the query that would inherently create NULL values on the left side when there are no matching rows on the right side (for INNER JOIN, this condition is naturally met; for LEFT JOIN, it is met if every row on the left side has at least one corresponding row on the right side according to the join condition).\n**Transformations**: 1. Identify the INNER JOIN or LEFT JOIN condition in the SQL query. 2. Extract the ON clause representing the join condition. 3. For INNER JOIN: - Replace the INNER JOIN with a WHERE EXISTS clause, moving the original join condition into the WHERE clause of a subquery that selects from the right side table. Reference the left side columns as correlation variables in the subquery\'s WHERE clause. - Example Transformation: SELECT * FROM left_table INNER JOIN right_table ON left_table.id = right_table.foreign_id Becomes: SELECT * FROM left_table WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM right_table WHERE left_table.id = right_table.foreign_id) 4. For LEFT JOIN: - Replace the LEFT JOIN with a LEFT OUTER JOIN subquery that is correlated to the outer query. In the SELECT clause of the outer query, include a CASE statement or similar logic to handle selection from the subquery result. - Example Transformation: SELECT left_table.*, right_table.* FROM left_table LEFT JOIN right_table ON left_table.id = right_table.foreign_id Becomes: SELECT left_table.*, COALESCE(subquery.alias1, \'default\') FROM left_table LEFT OUTER JOIN (SELECT foreign_id, column1 AS alias1 FROM right_table) subquery ON left_table.id = subquery.foreign_id"""\n\n### Rule JOIN_LEFT_UNION_TRANSPOSE:\n"""**Conditions**: The SQL join operation has a `UNION ALL` on its left side. The join operation contains no correlated subqueries (i.e., no subqueries referencing columns from the outer query) in its ON clause. The join is not part of an outer join on the null-producing side, ensuring it doesn\'t unintentionally omit rows that should produce nulls on the outer side when no match is found.\n**Transformations**: For each input branch of the original `UNION ALL`, create a separate join operation with the right-hand side of the original join. This results in two or more join operations depending on the number of branches in the `UNION ALL`. Retain the same join type and join conditions for each new join operation as in the original join. Combine the results of these new join operations using `UNION ALL`."""'}], 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'stream': False, 'temperature': 0.1}}

For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN.

The filter\'s expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there\'s a matching row in the non-preserving side\'s table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned."""\n\n### Rule AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: - The SQL query contains a `GROUP BY` clause that groups by simple columns (no expressions in the `GROUP BY` list).\n- The aggregate functions in the `SELECT` clause operate directly on columns (no expressions inside the aggregate functions).\n- The `SELECT` clause only contains the columns used in the `GROUP BY` clause and the aggregates without any transformations or additional expressions.\n**Transformations**: - Directly apply the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions to the data source referred to in the `FROM` clause of the inner query before the projection.\n- Eliminate the outer projection layer if it only renames the columns without transforming them.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: - The `SELECT` clause of an outer query precisely matches the columns used in the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions of an inner query, without any column transformations or renamings.\n- The inner `SELECT` only serves as a passthrough for these columns.\n**Transformations**: - Remove the inner `SELECT` layer, directly applying the aggregate functions and `GROUP BY` to the original data source."""\n\n### Rule FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains conditions that can be statically determined as always true (e.g., constant expressions like `1=1` or tautologies based on the column data types and constraints), then these conditions don\'t affect the result set.\n**Transformations**: Remove such conditions from the WHERE clause. If this results in an empty WHERE clause, remove the WHERE clause entirely.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause simplifies to conditions that are always false or involve comparisons with NULL in a way that the outcome is always false or NULL (e.g., `column != column` or `1=0`), indicating no rows can satisfy the filter.\n**Transformations**: Replace the query with one that selects no rows. This could be represented in different ways based on the SQL dialect. One universal method might be selecting from a dual table with a false condition.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains complex conditions that can be simplified based on known constraints, constants, or through logical simplification (e.g., `column IS NOT NULL AND column IS NOT NULL` simplifies to `column IS NOT NULL`).\n**Transformations**: Simplify the conditions according to logical rules and known constraints. Remove redundancy and unnecessary complexity."""\n\n### Rule FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: The query contains a scalar sub-query within the WHERE clause.\n**Transformations**: The scalar sub-query should be transformed into a LEFT JOIN operation with an aggregate function on the column(s) being selected in the sub-query. The JOIN condition uses the correlation ID (the matching column(s) in both outer and sub-query).\n  - Original Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 WHERE column = (SELECT AGG_FUNCTION(column2) FROM table2 WHERE table1.join_column = table2.join_column)\n  - Transformed Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 LEFT JOIN (SELECT join_column, AGG_FUNCTION(column2) AS agg_result FROM table2 GROUP BY join_column) AS sub_query ON table1.join_column = sub_query.join_column WHERE column = sub_query.agg_result\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: The query contains `IN`, `EXISTS`, or `UNIQUE` sub-queries within the WHERE clause that are correlated with the outer query.\n**Transformations**: - For `IN` Sub-queries: Replace the `IN` clause with a JOIN operation and a WHERE condition that checks for non-null values on the side of the sub-query.\n    - Original Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 WHERE column IN (SELECT column2 FROM table2 WHERE table1.join_column = table2.join_column)\n    - Transformed Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.join_column = table2.join_column WHERE table2.column2 IS NOT NULL\n  - For `EXISTS` Sub-queries: Convert the `EXISTS` condition into a JOIN operation, using WHERE to filter rows that match the JOIN condition.\n    - Original Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM table2 WHERE table1.join_column = table2.join_class)\n    - Transformed Query Structure: SELECT DISTINCT table1.* FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.join_column = table2.join_column\n  - For `UNIQUE` Sub-queries: Since `UNIQUE` requires a bit more complex handling not directly mappable to a standard JOIN, it should be considered a special case where the goal is to ensure that rows from the outer query match a unique set in the sub-query. This might not translate directly into SQL syntax without additional sub-query or DISTINCT aggregation."""\n\n### Rule SORT_PROJECT_TRANSPOSE:\n"""**Conditions**: If a SQL query executes a sort operation on columns that are directly referenced in the SELECT list or through expressions that are strictly monotonic transformations of these columns, and the sort operation directly follows these projections (SELECT statements), the sort operation can be pushed to operate directly on the table (FROM clause) before the projection.\n**Transformations**: 1. Check Compatibility: Ensure both sort and project (SELECT and ORDER BY clauses) involve compatible operations that relate directly to the raw column data or involve monotonic transformations.\n2. Analyze Order By Fields: Verify that each column in the ORDER BY clause is directly represented in the SELECT list or is a derived column through a monotonic transformation (e.g., casting integers to floats where the order is preserved).\n3. Adjust SQL Query: Rewrite the query so that sorting (ORDER BY clause) is applied to the raw table data in the FROM clause rather than after the projection. This might involve introducing a subquery or CTE (Common Table Expression) where the sorting is applied first, followed by the projections.\n4. Optimize Projection: Ensure that the SELECT list in the outer query matches the original projection, applying on top of the sorted data now."""'}], 'response': 'Step 1: To align the query rewrite rules with the provided suggestions, we need to prioritize the rules that directly relate to the suggestions.

Firstly, conditions that only involve columns from one side of their respective joins can be moved from the `WHERE` clause to the `ON` clause of INNER JOINs, reducing data size before joins and enhancing efficiency. Secondly, removing intermediate CTE layers and directly applying aggregate functions and `GROUP BY` operations to the original data source can streamline the execution plan. Simplifying range checks into search arguments makes conditions more Sargable, allowing better use of indexes. Scalar sub-queries can be transformed into LEFT JOIN operations with aggregate functions, eliminating unnecessary sub-queries and improving performance. Pre-aggregating data before joining with other tables can reduce intermediate dataset sizes, enhancing query efficiency. Combining `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY` can optimize sorting by stopping once the required rows are obtained, especially if the `ORDER BY` columns are indexed. Lastly, replacing `DISTINCT` with `GROUP BY` in the `my_customers` CTE can leverage indexes more effectively, potentially improving execution efficiency. These strategies collectively aim to reduce data processing, leverage indexing, and streamline query execution for better performance."""\n\nQuery Rewrite Rules:\n### Rule FILTER_INTO_JOIN:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: This SQL query rewrite rule applies when a filter condition is placed on the result set of an INNER JOIN operation. The filter\'s expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN.

Firstly, conditions that only involve columns from one side of their respective joins can be moved from the `WHERE` clause to the `ON` clause of INNER JOINs, reducing data size before joins and enhancing efficiency. Secondly, removing intermediate CTE layers and directly applying aggregate functions and `GROUP BY` operations to the original data source can streamline the execution plan. Simplifying range checks into search arguments makes conditions more Sargable, allowing better use of indexes. Scalar sub-queries can be transformed into LEFT JOIN operations with aggregate functions, eliminating unnecessary sub-queries and improving performance. Pre-aggregating data before joining with other tables can reduce intermediate dataset sizes, enhancing query efficiency. Combining `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY` can optimize sorting by stopping once the required rows are obtained, especially if the `ORDER BY` columns are indexed. Lastly, replacing `DISTINCT` with `GROUP BY` in the `my_customers` CTE can leverage indexes more effectively, potentially improving execution efficiency. These strategies collectively aim to reduce data processing, leverage indexing, and streamline query execution for better performance."""\n\nQuery Rewrite Rules:\n### Rule FILTER_INTO_JOIN:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: This SQL query rewrite rule applies when a filter condition is placed on the result set of an INNER JOIN operation. The filter\'s expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there\'s a matching row in the non-preserving side\'s table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned."""\n\n### Rule AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: - The SQL query contains a `GROUP BY` clause that groups by simple columns (no expressions in the `GROUP BY` list).\n- The aggregate functions in the `SELECT` clause operate directly on columns (no expressions inside the aggregate functions).\n- The `SELECT` clause only contains the columns used in the `GROUP BY` clause and the aggregates without any transformations or additional expressions.\n**Transformations**: - Directly apply the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions to the data source referred to in the `FROM` clause of the inner query before the projection.\n- Eliminate the outer projection layer if it only renames the columns without transforming them.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: - The `SELECT` clause of an outer query precisely matches the columns used in the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions of an inner query, without any column transformations or renamings.\n- The inner `SELECT` only serves as a passthrough for these columns.\n**Transformations**: - Remove the inner `SELECT` layer, directly applying the aggregate functions and `GROUP BY` to the original data source."""\n\n### Rule FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains conditions that can be statically determined as always true (e.g., constant expressions like `1=1` or tautologies based on the column data types and constraints), then these conditions don\'t affect the result set.\n**Transformations**: Remove such conditions from the WHERE clause. If this results in an empty WHERE clause, remove the WHERE clause entirely.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause simplifies to conditions that are always false or involve comparisons with NULL in a way that the outcome is always false or NULL (e.g., `column != column` or `1=0`), indicating no rows can satisfy the filter.\n**Transformations**: Replace the query with one that selects no rows. This could be represented in different ways based on the SQL dialect. One universal method might be selecting from a dual table with a false condition.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains complex conditions that can be simplified based on known constraints, constants, or through logical simplification (e.g., `column IS NOT NULL AND column IS NOT NULL` simplifies to `column IS NOT NULL`).\n**Transformations**: Simplify the conditions according to logical rules and known constraints. Remove redundancy and unnecessary complexity."""\n\n### Rule FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: The query contains a scalar sub-query within the WHERE clause.\n**Transformations**: The scalar sub-query should be transformed into a LEFT JOIN operation with an aggregate function on the column(s) being selected in the sub-query. The JOIN condition uses the correlation ID (the matching column(s) in both outer and sub-query).\n  - Original Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 WHERE column = (SELECT AGG_FUNCTION(column2) FROM table2 WHERE table1.join_column = table2.join_column)\n  - Transformed Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 LEFT JOIN (SELECT join_column, AGG_FUNCTION(column2) AS agg_result FROM table2 GROUP BY join_column) AS sub_query ON table1.join_column = sub_query.join_column WHERE column = sub_query.agg_result\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: The query contains `IN`, `EXISTS`, or `UNIQUE` sub-queries within the WHERE clause that are correlated with the outer query.\n**Transformations**: - For `IN` Sub-queries: Replace the `IN` clause with a JOIN operation and a WHERE condition that checks for non-null values on the side of the sub-query.\n    - Original Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 WHERE column IN (SELECT column2 FROM table2 WHERE table1.join_column = table2.join_column)\n    - Transformed Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.join_column = table2.join_column WHERE table2.column2 IS NOT NULL\n  - For `EXISTS` Sub-queries: Convert the `EXISTS` condition into a JOIN operation, using WHERE to filter rows that match the JOIN condition.\n    - Original Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM table2 WHERE table1.join_column = table2.join_class)\n    - Transformed Query Structure: SELECT DISTINCT table1.* FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.join_column = table2.join_column\n  - For `UNIQUE` Sub-queries: Since `UNIQUE` requires a bit more complex handling not directly mappable to a standard JOIN, it should be considered a special case where the goal is to ensure that rows from the outer query match a unique set in the sub-query. This might not translate directly into SQL syntax without additional sub-query or DISTINCT aggregation."""\n\n### Rule SORT_PROJECT_TRANSPOSE:\n"""**Conditions**: If a SQL query executes a sort operation on columns that are directly referenced in the SELECT list or through expressions that are strictly monotonic transformations of these columns, and the sort operation directly follows these projections (SELECT statements), the sort operation can be pushed to operate directly on the table (FROM clause) before the projection.\n**Transformations**: 1. Check Compatibility: Ensure both sort and project (SELECT and ORDER BY clauses) involve compatible operations that relate directly to the raw column data or involve monotonic transformations.\n2. Analyze Order By Fields: Verify that each column in the ORDER BY clause is directly represented in the SELECT list or is a derived column through a monotonic transformation (e.g., casting integers to floats where the order is preserved).\n3. Adjust SQL Query: Rewrite the query so that sorting (ORDER BY clause) is applied to the raw table data in the FROM clause rather than after the projection. This might involve introducing a subquery or CTE (Common Table Expression) where the sorting is applied first, followed by the projections.\n4. Optimize Projection: Ensure that the SELECT list in the outer query matches the original projection, applying on top of the sorted data now."""\n\nArranged Rule Sequence: ["FILTER_INTO_JOIN", "FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE", "FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS", "AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE", "SORT_PROJECT_TRANSPOSE"]\n\nUtilized Rules: ["FILTER_INTO_JOIN", "FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE", "AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE", "SORT_PROJECT_TRANSPOSE"]\n\nUnutilized Rules: ["FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS"]'}], 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'stream': False, 'temperature': 0.1}}

Firstly, conditions that only involve columns from one side of their respective joins can be moved from the `WHERE` clause to the `ON` clause of INNER JOINs, reducing data size before joins and enhancing efficiency. Secondly, removing intermediate CTE layers and directly applying aggregate functions and `GROUP BY` operations to the original data source can streamline the execution plan. Simplifying range checks into search arguments makes conditions more Sargable, allowing better use of indexes. Scalar sub-queries can be transformed into LEFT JOIN operations with aggregate functions, eliminating unnecessary sub-queries and improving performance. Pre-aggregating data before joining with other tables can reduce intermediate dataset sizes, enhancing query efficiency. Combining `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY` can optimize sorting by stopping once the required rows are obtained, especially if the `ORDER BY` columns are indexed. Lastly, replacing `DISTINCT` with `GROUP BY` in the `my_customers` CTE can leverage indexes more effectively, potentially improving execution efficiency. These strategies collectively aim to reduce data processing, leverage indexing, and streamline query execution for better performance."""\n\nQuery Rewrite Rules:\n### Rule FILTER_INTO_JOIN:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: This SQL query rewrite rule applies when a filter condition is placed on the result set of an INNER JOIN operation. The filter\'s expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there\'s a matching row in the non-preserving side\'s table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned."""\n\n### Rule AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: - The SQL query contains a `GROUP BY` clause that groups by simple columns (no expressions in the `GROUP BY` list).\n- The aggregate functions in the `SELECT` clause operate directly on columns (no expressions inside the aggregate functions).\n- The `SELECT` clause only contains the columns used in the `GROUP BY` clause and the aggregates without any transformations or additional expressions.\n**Transformations**: - Directly apply the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions to the data source referred to in the `FROM` clause of the inner query before the projection.\n- Eliminate the outer projection layer if it only renames the columns without transforming them.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: - The `SELECT` clause of an outer query precisely matches the columns used in the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions of an inner query, without any column transformations or renamings.\n- The inner `SELECT` only serves as a passthrough for these columns.\n**Transformations**: - Remove the inner `SELECT` layer, directly applying the aggregate functions and `GROUP BY` to the original data source."""\n\n### Rule FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains conditions that can be statically determined as always true (e.g., constant expressions like `1=1` or tautologies based on the column data types and constraints), then these conditions don\'t affect the result set.\n**Transformations**: Remove such conditions from the WHERE clause. If this results in an empty WHERE clause, remove the WHERE clause entirely.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause simplifies to conditions that are always false or involve comparisons with NULL in a way that the outcome is always false or NULL (e.g., `column != column` or `1=0`), indicating no rows can satisfy the filter.\n**Transformations**: Replace the query with one that selects no rows. This could be represented in different ways based on the SQL dialect. One universal method might be selecting from a dual table with a false condition.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains complex conditions that can be simplified based on known constraints, constants, or through logical simplification (e.g., `column IS NOT NULL AND column IS NOT NULL` simplifies to `column IS NOT NULL`).\n**Transformations**: Simplify the conditions according to logical rules and known constraints. Remove redundancy and unnecessary complexity."""\n\n### Rule FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: The query contains a scalar sub-query within the WHERE clause.\n**Transformations**: The scalar sub-query should be transformed into a LEFT JOIN operation with an aggregate function on the column(s) being selected in the sub-query. The JOIN condition uses the correlation ID (the matching column(s) in both outer and sub-query).\n  - Original Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 WHERE column = (SELECT AGG_FUNCTION(column2) FROM table2 WHERE table1.join_column = table2.join_column)\n  - Transformed Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 LEFT JOIN (SELECT join_column, AGG_FUNCTION(column2) AS agg_result FROM table2 GROUP BY join_column) AS sub_query ON table1.join_column = sub_query.join_column WHERE column = sub_query.agg_result\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: The query contains `IN`, `EXISTS`, or `UNIQUE` sub-queries within the WHERE clause that are correlated with the outer query.\n**Transformations**: - For `IN` Sub-queries: Replace the `IN` clause with a JOIN operation and a WHERE condition that checks for non-null values on the side of the sub-query.\n    - Original Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 WHERE column IN (SELECT column2 FROM table2 WHERE table1.join_column = table2.join_column)\n    - Transformed Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.join_column = table2.join_column WHERE table2.column2 IS NOT NULL\n  - For `EXISTS` Sub-queries: Convert the `EXISTS` condition into a JOIN operation, using WHERE to filter rows that match the JOIN condition.\n    - Original Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM table2 WHERE table1.join_column = table2.join_class)\n    - Transformed Query Structure: SELECT DISTINCT table1.* FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.join_column = table2.join_column\n  - For `UNIQUE` Sub-queries: Since `UNIQUE` requires a bit more complex handling not directly mappable to a standard JOIN, it should be considered a special case where the goal is to ensure that rows from the outer query match a unique set in the sub-query. This might not translate directly into SQL syntax without additional sub-query or DISTINCT aggregation."""\n\n### Rule SORT_PROJECT_TRANSPOSE:\n"""**Conditions**: If a SQL query executes a sort operation on columns that are directly referenced in the SELECT list or through expressions that are strictly monotonic transformations of these columns, and the sort operation directly follows these projections (SELECT statements), the sort operation can be pushed to operate directly on the table (FROM clause) before the projection.\n**Transformations**: 1. Check Compatibility: Ensure both sort and project (SELECT and ORDER BY clauses) involve compatible operations that relate directly to the raw column data or involve monotonic transformations.\n2. Analyze Order By Fields: Verify that each column in the ORDER BY clause is directly represented in the SELECT list or is a derived column through a monotonic transformation (e.g., casting integers to floats where the order is preserved).\n3. Adjust SQL Query: Rewrite the query so that sorting (ORDER BY clause) is applied to the raw table data in the FROM clause rather than after the projection. This might involve introducing a subquery or CTE (Common Table Expression) where the sorting is applied first, followed by the projections.\n4. Optimize Projection: Ensure that the SELECT list in the outer query matches the original projection, applying on top of the sorted data now."""\n\nArranged Rule Sequence: ["FILTER_INTO_JOIN", "FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE", "FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS", "AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE", "SORT_PROJECT_TRANSPOSE"]\n\nUtilized Rules: ["FILTER_INTO_JOIN", "FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE", "AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE", "SORT_PROJECT_TRANSPOSE"]\n\nUnutilized Rules: ["FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS"]'}], 'response': 'Step 1: The unutilized rule "FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS" does not match any of the provided query rewrite suggestions.
