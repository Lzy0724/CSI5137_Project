Application of methods such as table pullout, duplicate weedout, first match, loose scan, and materialization.\n   - Transformation involves discarding non-matching rows in the outer query earlier, possibly by pulling relevant data into a temporary structure or scanning data in a manner that avoids processing duplicate information unnecessarily.\n   \n2. **Anti-Join Optimizations:**\n   - Utilization of explicit JOINs for negated subqueries, especially transforming `NOT IN` and `NOT EXISTS` into configurations that efficiently exclude non-matching rows.\n   - Optimization might include the use of LEFT OUTER JOIN combined with WHERE clauses that filter on NULL values from the right table of the JOIN, effectively implementing the anti-join pattern.\n   \n3. **General JOIN Optimizations:**\n   - Recommending explicit JOINs over `EXISTS` or `IN` operators to leverage database optimizations for JOIN operations, which might include better use of indexes and optimized data access paths.\n   - Optimization through the selection of appropriate JOIN types (e.g., INNER JOIN, LEFT OUTER JOIN) based on the query\'s requirements and the expected data distributions, ensuring that the execution strategy minimizes resource usage while maximizing performance.\n\nThis approach underscores a tailored execution strategy selection, prioritizing JOIN transformations that align with the query\'s specific predicates and the correlation dynamics between queries and subqueries.\n"""\nRule 2:\n"""\n**Conditions**: The SQL query utilizes traditional filtering mechanisms such as NOT EXISTS, NOT IN, EXISTS, IN, OR within JOINs and WHERE clauses.\n**Transformations**: - Replace IN with INTERSECT for querying intersecting datasets to potentially improve index usage and query speed.\n- Rewrite conditions using the OR operator into a series of UNION ALL operations to enhance code maintainability and performance.\n- Use EXCEPT instead of NOT IN or anti-joins to minimize duplicate row processing and optimize resource use, effectively reducing execution time.\n"""\nRule 3:\n"""\n**Conditions**: - The SQL query performs a `GROUP BY` operation along with other operations like `JOIN`.\n- Query performance could be enhanced by reducing the size of intermediate datasets.\n- Suitable for queries involving large datasets or attributes from Entity-Attribute-Value (EAV) tables.\n- Applicable when reordering the sequence of operations can lead to performance improvements.\n**Transformations**: - Rearrange the query to perform `GROUP BY` operations at the earliest stage, ideally before executing operations like `JOIN`.\n- Utilize subqueries for pre-aggregation to reduce the dataset size early in the execution process.\n- Directly restructure the query to prioritize grouping operations to minimize the workload on subsequent operations like `JOIN`, thereby enhancing overall execution speed and efficiency.\n"""\nRule 4:\n"""\n**Conditions**: The SQL query optimization rules apply under the following conditions:\n1. When the `LIMIT` clause is used to fetch a specified number of rows.\n2. When `ORDER BY` is used in conjunction with `LIMIT` to sort and limit the number of rows retrieved, particularly when sorting can leverage an index.\n3. When `DISTINCT` is used along with `LIMIT` to quickly identify and return unique rows without scanning the full dataset.\n4. During the use of `GROUP BY`, where optimization might involve sorting or traversing indexes in order to efficiently compute group values without processing the entire dataset.\n5. When sorting a specific number of rows from a single table based on non-indexed columns, utilizing in-memory sorting (`filesort`) techniques.\n**Transformations**: The specific SQL transformations that emerge from applying these optimization rules are:\n1. Combining `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY` encourages the database engine to stop the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained, avoiding full table sorts.\n2. Using `LIMIT` with `DISTINCT` leads to an early termination of the search for unique rows as soon as the needed amount is gathered, reducing time and resources spent on scanning the entire dataset.\n3. In the context of `GROUP BY`, optimizations may include indexing strategies or modifications to the way sorting is handled, such as employing `filesort` mechanisms that do not require temporary tables, ensuring that the database engine processes only the necessary data for group computations.\n4. Efficiencies are gained by encouraging the use of indexed columns with `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT`, making queries more efficient by reducing the cost associated with sorting and filtering operations.\n"""\nRule 5:\n"""\n**Conditions**: The rule applies when the original SQL query performs multiple scans or joins on the same table to retrieve different attributes for certain conditions, or when the query structure results in redundant data processing and complexity that could be reduced.\n**Transformations**: - Combine multiple joins into a single join operation by using `CASE` statements to conditionally select different attributes from the table in one pass. \n- Use the `COALESCE` function in conjunction with `CASE` statements to efficiently merge conditional attributes into distinct columns based on specific criteria without the need for additional joins.\n- Optimize the selection of conditional attributes by integrating `GROUP BY` with aggregate functions like `MAX` within `CASE` statements, thus condensing the result set to only the necessary data and avoiding needless retrieval and processing steps.\n- The overall transformation leads to a single, more efficient query that accomplishes the tasks of multiple, less efficient operations, improving performance, and simplifying the query for better readability and maintenance.\n"""\nRule 6:\n"""\n**Conditions**: The rule applies when there is a use of `IN` or `=ANY` comparison involving a subquery. It is also applicable for scenarios dealing with composite keys or multiple columns, and there is a consideration for handling `NULL` values in subqueries to maintain logical integrity.\n**Transformations**: 1. Convert `outer_expr IN (SELECT inner_expr FROM ... WHERE subquery_where)` into an equivalent `EXISTS` query, adding an `AND outer_expr=inner_expr` condition within the subquery\'s `WHERE` clause. This narrows down the rows the database needs to evaluate.\n2. For composite keys or conditions involving multiple columns, expand the added equality condition to include comparisons for all relevant columns, i.e., `AND outer_col1=inner_col1 AND outer_col2=inner_col2 AND ...`.\n3. Include conditions to handle `NULL` values appropriately, ensuring the query accounts for scenarios where `inner_expr` might be `NULL`. This can involve adding conditions like `OR inner_expr IS NULL` within the subquery to ensure the integrity and completeness of the logic.\n"""'}], 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'stream': False, 'temperature': 0.1}}

The filter's expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there's a matching row in the non-preserving side's table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned.\n```\n\nLogical Plan Changes After Rewrite: ```\n  LogicalSort(sort0=[$0(i_item_id)], sort1=[$1(sr_return_quantity)], dir0=[ASC], dir1=[ASC], fetch=[100])\r\n    LogicalProject(item_id=[$0(i_item_id)], sr_item_qty=[$1(sr_return_quantity)], sr_dev=[*(/(/($1(sr_return_quantity), +(+($1(sr_return_quantity), $3(cr_return_quantity)), $5(wr_return_quantity))), 3.0:DECIMAL(2, 1)), 100)], cr_item_qty=[$3(cr_return_quantity)], cr_dev=[*(/(/($3(cr_return_quantity), +(+($1(sr_return_quantity), $3(cr_return_quantity)), $5(wr_return_quantity))), 3.0:DECIMAL(2, 1)), 100)], wr_item_qty=[$5(wr_return_quantity)], wr_dev=[*(/(/($5(wr_return_quantity), +(+($1(sr_return_quantity), $3(cr_return_quantity)), $5(wr_return_quantity))), 3.0:DECIMAL(2, 1)), 100)], average=[/(+(+($1(sr_return_quantity), $3(cr_return_quantity)), $5(wr_return_quantity)), 3.0:DECIMAL(2, 1))])\r\n-     LogicalFilter(condition=[AND(=($0(i_item_id), $2(i_item_id)), =($0(i_item_id), $4(i_item_id)))])\r\n+     LogicalJoin(condition=[=($0(i_item_id), $4(i_item_id))], joinType=[inner])\r\n-       LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n?

the columns used in the `GROUP BY` clause and the aggregates without any transformations or additional expressions.\n**Transformations**: - Directly apply the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions to the data source referred to in the `FROM` clause of the inner query before the projection.\n- Eliminate the outer projection layer if it only renames the columns without transforming them.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: - The `SELECT` clause of an outer query precisely matches the columns used in the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions of an inner query, without any column transformations or

This could be represented in different ways based on the SQL dialect. One universal method might be selecting from a dual table with a false condition.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains complex conditions that can be simplified based on known constraints, constants, or through logical simplification (e.g., `column IS NOT NULL AND column IS NOT NULL` simplifies to `column IS NOT NULL`).\n**Transformations**: Simplify the conditions according to logical rules and known constraints.

the columns used in the `GROUP BY` clause and the aggregates without any transformations or additional expressions.\n**Transformations**: - Directly apply the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions to the data source referred to in the `FROM` clause of the inner query before the projection.\n- Eliminate the outer projection layer if it only renames the columns without transforming them.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: - The `SELECT` clause of an outer query precisely matches the columns used in the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions of an inner query, without any column transformations or renamings.\n- The inner `SELECT` only serves as a passthrough for these columns.\n**Transformations**: - Remove the inner `SELECT` layer, directly applying the aggregate functions and `GROUP BY` to

The main changes involve the removal of the `LogicalProject` nodes that were previously used to rename columns after aggregation. Instead, the `LogicalAggregate` nodes now directly use the columns from the data sources, and the `LogicalFilter` nodes are applied directly to the data sources without an intermediate projection.\n\nStep 2: Parsing the logical plan changes, we observe the following detailed changes:\n- The `LogicalAggregate` nodes now directly group by the item ID columns from the respective tables (`store_returns`, `catalog_returns`, `web_returns`) without an intermediate projection.\n- The `LogicalProject` nodes that were previously used to rename columns after aggregation have been removed.\n- The `LogicalFilter` nodes are now directly applied to the data sources (`store_returns`, `catalog_returns`, `web_returns`, `item`, `date_dim`) without an intermediate projection.\n- The joins between the tables are now directly performed without an intermediate projection layer.\n\nStep 3: The SQL query rewrite rule contains two cases. Based on the parsed SQL query changes, the rewrite matches Case 1. This is because:\n- The original SQL query contains `GROUP BY` clauses that group by simple columns (`i_item_id`).\n- The aggregate functions (`SUM`) operate directly on columns (`sr_return_quantity`, `cr_return_quantity`, `wr_return_quantity`).\n- The `SELECT` clause in the CTEs (`sr_items`, `cr_items`, `wr_items`) only contains the columns used in the `GROUP BY` clause and the aggregates without any transformations or additional expressions.\n\nStep 4: In Case 1, the rewrite rule applies the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions directly to the data sources referred to in the `FROM` clause of the inner query before the projection. The outer projection layer is eliminated if it only renames the columns without transforming them. In the given SQL query, the `LogicalProject` nodes that were used to rename columns after aggregation have been removed, and the `LogicalAggregate` nodes now directly use the columns from the data sources. This results in a more efficient query execution plan by reducing unnecessary intermediate steps and directly applying the necessary operations to the data sources.', 'time': 4.62492299079895}

The filter's expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there's a matching row in the non-preserving side's table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned.\n```\n\nLogical Plan Changes After Rewrite: ```\n  LogicalSort(sort0=[$0(i_item_id)], sort1=[$1(sr_return_quantity)], dir0=[ASC], dir1=[ASC], fetch=[100])\r\n    LogicalProject(item_id=[$0(i_item_id)], sr_item_qty=[$1(sr_return_quantity)], sr_dev=[*(/(/($1(sr_return_quantity), +(+($1(sr_return_quantity), $3(cr_return_quantity)), $5(wr_return_quantity))), 3.0:DECIMAL(2, 1)), 100)], cr_item_qty=[$3(cr_return_quantity)], cr_dev=[*(/(/($3(cr_return_quantity), +(+($1(sr_return_quantity), $3(cr_return_quantity)), $5(wr_return_quantity))), 3.0:DECIMAL(2, 1)), 100)], wr_item_qty=[$5(wr_return_quantity)], wr_dev=[*(/(/($5(wr_return_quantity), +(+($1(sr_return_quantity), $3(cr_return_quantity)), $5(wr_return_quantity))), 3.0:DECIMAL(2, 1)), 100)], average=[/(+(+($1(sr_return_quantity), $3(cr_return_quantity)), $5(wr_return_quantity)), 3.0:DECIMAL(2, 1))])\r\n-     LogicalFilter(condition=[AND(=($0(i_item_id), $2(i_item_id)), =($0(i_item_id), $4(i_item_id)))])\r\n+     LogicalJoin(condition=[=($0(i_item_id), $4(i_item_id))], joinType=[inner])\r\n-       LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n?

Specifically, the filters that were previously applied after the joins are now pushed down to be part of the join conditions themselves. This is evident from the transformation of `LogicalFilter` conditions into `LogicalJoin` conditions, where the join conditions now include additional filtering logic.\n\nStep 2: Parsing the logical plan changes, we observe the following detailed changes in the SQL query:\n- The original query had filter conditions applied in the WHERE clause after the joins, such as `sr_item_sk = i_item_sk`, `cr_item_sk = i_item_sk`, and `wr_item_sk = i_item_sk`, along with conditions on `d_date`, `i_category`, `i_manager_id`, and return amount calculations.\n- These conditions have been moved into the ON clause of the INNER JOINs. For example, conditions like `sr_item_sk = i_item_sk` and `sr_returned_date_sk = d_date_sk` are now part of the join conditions in the rewritten query.\n\nStep 3: The query rewrite rule contains multiple cases, but the changes observed match Case 1. This case applies when a filter condition is placed on the result set of an INNER JOIN operation, and the filter's expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join. The conditions can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs. In this query, the conditions involve columns from only one side of the join (e.g., `sr_item_sk = i_item_sk`), allowing them to be moved into the ON clause.\n\nStep 4: The SQL query changes can be explained by Case 1 of the query rewrite rule. The original query had filter conditions applied after the joins, which could be logically associated with columns from one side of the join. By moving these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOINs, the query optimizer can potentially reduce the size of the datasets before performing the join operations. This transformation improves query efficiency by filtering data earlier in the execution plan, thus reducing the amount of data processed in subsequent operations. The detailed changes, such as moving conditions like `sr_item_sk = i_item_sk` into the join conditions, illustrate this optimization process.", 'time': 5.998478651046753}

Specifically, the changes involve the transformation of range and set membership conditions into more efficient search arguments (SARGs). This is evident from the transformation of conditions like `i_manager_id BETWEEN 47 and 56` and `sr_reason_sk in (9, 13, 26, 40, 44)` into `SEARCH($40(i_manager_id), Sarg[[47..56]])` and `SEARCH($8(sr_reason_sk), Sarg[9, 13, 26, 40, 44])`, respectively.\n\nStep 2: Parsing the logical plan changes, we identify that the SQL query's WHERE clause conditions involving the `BETWEEN` and `IN` operators have been optimized. The conditions `i_manager_id BETWEEN 47 and 56` and `sr_reason_sk in (9, 13, 26, 40, 44)` in the `store_returns` subquery, as well as similar conditions in the `catalog_returns` and `web_returns` subqueries, have been transformed into search arguments. This optimization is applied to the columns `i_manager_id` and `sr_reason_sk` (and their equivalents in other subqueries).\n\nStep 3: The query rewrite rule contains multiple cases. The parsed SQL query changes match Case 3 of the query rewrite rule. Case 3 involves simplifying complex conditions based on known constraints or logical simplifications. The transformation of `BETWEEN` and `IN` conditions into SARGs is a form of logical simplification that optimizes the query execution.\n\nStep 4: In this query rewrite process, the SQL query's WHERE clause conditions involving `BETWEEN` and `IN` operators have been simplified into search arguments (SARGs). This transformation is a logical simplification that enhances query performance by allowing the database engine to use more efficient index-based searches. The conditions `i_manager_id BETWEEN 47 and 56` and `sr_reason_sk in (9, 13, 26, 40, 44)` in the `store_returns` subquery, as well as similar conditions in the `catalog_returns` and `web_returns` subqueries, have been rewritten to `SEARCH($40(i_manager_id), Sarg[[47..56]])` and `SEARCH($8(sr_reason_sk), Sarg[9, 13, 26, 40, 44])`, respectively. This optimization reduces the complexity of the query and improves its execution efficiency.", 'time': 6.1785948276519775}

Application of methods such as table pullout, duplicate weedout, first match, loose scan, and materialization.\n   - Transformation involves discarding non-matching rows in the outer query earlier, possibly by pulling relevant data into a temporary structure or scanning data in a manner that avoids processing duplicate information unnecessarily.\n   \n2. **Anti-Join Optimizations:**\n   - Utilization of explicit JOINs for negated subqueries, especially transforming `NOT IN` and `NOT EXISTS` into configurations that efficiently exclude non-matching rows.\n   - Optimization might include the use of LEFT OUTER JOIN combined with WHERE clauses that filter on NULL values from the right table of the JOIN, effectively implementing the anti-join pattern.\n   \n3. **General JOIN Optimizations:**\n   - Recommending explicit JOINs over `EXISTS` or `IN` operators to leverage database optimizations for JOIN operations, which might include better use of indexes and optimized data access paths.\n   - Optimization through the selection of appropriate JOIN types (e.g., INNER JOIN, LEFT OUTER JOIN) based on the query\'s requirements and the expected data distributions, ensuring that the execution strategy minimizes resource usage while maximizing performance.\n\nThis approach underscores a tailored execution strategy selection, prioritizing JOIN transformations that align with the query\'s specific predicates and the correlation dynamics between queries and subqueries.\n"""\nRule 2:\n"""\n**Conditions**: The SQL query utilizes traditional filtering mechanisms such as NOT EXISTS, NOT IN, EXISTS, IN, OR within JOINs and WHERE clauses.\n**Transformations**: - Replace IN with INTERSECT for querying intersecting datasets to potentially improve index usage and query speed.\n- Rewrite conditions using the OR operator into a series of UNION ALL operations to enhance code maintainability and performance.\n- Use EXCEPT instead of NOT IN or anti-joins to minimize duplicate row processing and optimize resource use, effectively reducing execution time.\n"""\nRule 3:\n"""\n**Conditions**: - The SQL query performs a `GROUP BY` operation along with other operations like `JOIN`.\n- Query performance could be enhanced by reducing the size of intermediate datasets.\n- Suitable for queries involving large datasets or attributes from Entity-Attribute-Value (EAV) tables.\n- Applicable when reordering the sequence of operations can lead to performance improvements.\n**Transformations**: - Rearrange the query to perform `GROUP BY` operations at the earliest stage, ideally before executing operations like `JOIN`.\n- Utilize subqueries for pre-aggregation to reduce the dataset size early in the execution process.\n- Directly restructure the query to prioritize grouping operations to minimize the workload on subsequent operations like `JOIN`, thereby enhancing overall execution speed and efficiency.\n"""\nRule 4:\n"""\n**Conditions**: The SQL query optimization rules apply under the following conditions:\n1. When the `LIMIT` clause is used to fetch a specified number of rows.\n2. When `ORDER BY` is used in conjunction with `LIMIT` to sort and limit the number of rows retrieved, particularly when sorting can leverage an index.\n3. When `DISTINCT` is used along with `LIMIT` to quickly identify and return unique rows without scanning the full dataset.\n4. During the use of `GROUP BY`, where optimization might involve sorting or traversing indexes in order to efficiently compute group values without processing the entire dataset.\n5. When sorting a specific number of rows from a single table based on non-indexed columns, utilizing in-memory sorting (`filesort`) techniques.\n**Transformations**: The specific SQL transformations that emerge from applying these optimization rules are:\n1. Combining `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY` encourages the database engine to stop the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained, avoiding full table sorts.\n2. Using `LIMIT` with `DISTINCT` leads to an early termination of the search for unique rows as soon as the needed amount is gathered, reducing time and resources spent on scanning the entire dataset.\n3. In the context of `GROUP BY`, optimizations may include indexing strategies or modifications to the way sorting is handled, such as employing `filesort` mechanisms that do not require temporary tables, ensuring that the database engine processes only the necessary data for group computations.\n4. Efficiencies are gained by encouraging the use of indexed columns with `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT`, making queries more efficient by reducing the cost associated with sorting and filtering operations.\n"""\nRule 5:\n"""\n**Conditions**: The rule applies when the original SQL query performs multiple scans or joins on the same table to retrieve different attributes for certain conditions, or when the query structure results in redundant data processing and complexity that could be reduced.\n**Transformations**: - Combine multiple joins into a single join operation by using `CASE` statements to conditionally select different attributes from the table in one pass. \n- Use the `COALESCE` function in conjunction with `CASE` statements to efficiently merge conditional attributes into distinct columns based on specific criteria without the need for additional joins.\n- Optimize the selection of conditional attributes by integrating `GROUP BY` with aggregate functions like `MAX` within `CASE` statements, thus condensing the result set to only the necessary data and avoiding needless retrieval and processing steps.\n- The overall transformation leads to a single, more efficient query that accomplishes the tasks of multiple, less efficient operations, improving performance, and simplifying the query for better readability and maintenance.\n"""\nRule 6:\n"""\n**Conditions**: The rule applies when there is a use of `IN` or `=ANY` comparison involving a subquery. It is also applicable for scenarios dealing with composite keys or multiple columns, and there is a consideration for handling `NULL` values in subqueries to maintain logical integrity.\n**Transformations**: 1. Convert `outer_expr IN (SELECT inner_expr FROM ... WHERE subquery_where)` into an equivalent `EXISTS` query, adding an `AND outer_expr=inner_expr` condition within the subquery\'s `WHERE` clause. This narrows down the rows the database needs to evaluate.\n2. For composite keys or conditions involving multiple columns, expand the added equality condition to include comparisons for all relevant columns, i.e., `AND outer_col1=inner_col1 AND outer_col2=inner_col2 AND ...`.\n3.

This matches the conditions for Rule 1, which focuses on optimizing such subqueries using JOIN transformations.\n\n- **Rule 2**: The query uses `IN` within subqueries, which matches the conditions for Rule 2. However, Rule 2 suggests replacing `IN` with `INTERSECT`, which may not be directly applicable here as the subqueries are not intended to find intersecting datasets but rather to filter based on specific date sequences.\n\n- **Rule 3**: The query performs `GROUP BY` operations within each CTE before joining them, which matches the conditions for Rule 3. However, the `GROUP BY` is already applied early in each CTE, so the transformation suggested by Rule 3 (reordering operations to perform `GROUP BY` earlier) is already in place.\n\n- **Rule 4**: The query uses `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY`, which matches the conditions for Rule 4. However, the transformation focuses on optimizing sorting and limiting operations, which may not significantly alter the query structure as the `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT` are already appropriately used.\n\n- **Rule 5**: The query does not perform multiple scans or joins on the same table to retrieve different attributes, nor does it have redundant data processing that could be reduced by combining joins. Therefore, Rule 5 does not match.\n\n- **Rule 6**: The query uses `IN` with subqueries, which matches the conditions for Rule 6.

Specifically, the sub-queries that were filtering dates based on a list of specific dates have been replaced by `JOIN` operations with aggregated results from the `date_dim` table.\n\nStep 2: Parsing the logical plan changes, we observe the following detailed changes:\n- The original sub-query structure using `IN` clauses:\n  ```sql\n  d_date in (select d_date from date_dim where d_month_seq in (select d_month_seq from date_dim where d_date in ('1998-03-09','1998-05-10','1998-07-15','1998-10-07')))\n  ```\n  has been replaced by:\n  ```sql\n  INNER JOIN (SELECT d_date FROM date_dim INNER JOIN (SELECT d_month_seq FROM date_dim WHERE d_date IN ('1998-03-09','1998-05-10','1998-07-15','1998-10-07')) AS sub_query ON date_dim.d_month_seq = sub_query.d_month_seq) AS date_filter ON date_dim.d_date = date_filter.d_date\n  ```\n- This transformation is applied to all three CTEs (`sr_items`, `cr_items`, `wr_items`) in the query.\n\nStep 3: The query rewrite rule contains two cases.

05:49:21,333 root INFO Generated queries:
Query 1: The SQL query changes can be explained by Case 1 of the query rewrite rule. The original query had filter conditions applied after the joins, which could be logically associated with columns from one side of the join. By moving these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOINs, the query optimizer can potentially reduce the size of the datasets before performing the join operations. This transformation improves query efficiency by filtering data earlier in the execution plan, thus reducing the amount of data processed in subsequent operations. The detailed changes, such as moving conditions like `sr_item_sk = i_item_sk` into the join conditions, illustrate this optimization process.
Query 2: In Case 1, the rewrite rule applies the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions directly to the data sources referred to in the `FROM` clause of the inner query before the projection. The outer projection layer is eliminated if it only renames the columns without transforming them. In the given SQL query, the `LogicalProject` nodes that were used to rename columns after aggregation have been removed, and the `LogicalAggregate` nodes now directly use the columns from the data sources. This results in a more efficient query execution plan by reducing unnecessary intermediate steps and directly applying the necessary operations to the data sources.
Query 3: In this query rewrite process, the SQL query's WHERE clause conditions involving `BETWEEN` and `IN` operators have been simplified into search arguments (SARGs). This transformation is a logical simplification that enhances query performance by allowing the database engine to use more efficient index-based searches. The conditions `i_manager_id BETWEEN 47 and 56` and `sr_reason_sk in (9, 13, 26, 40, 44)` in the `store_returns` subquery, as well as similar conditions in the `catalog_returns` and `web_returns` subqueries, have been rewritten to `SEARCH($40(i_manager_id), Sarg[[47..56]])` and `SEARCH($8(sr_reason_sk), Sarg[9, 13, 26, 40, 44])`, respectively. This optimization reduces the complexity of the query and improves its execution efficiency.
Query 4: The SQL query changes can be explained as follows:
- The original query used `IN` sub-queries to filter dates based on specific conditions. These sub-queries were correlated with the outer query through the `d_date` and `d_month_seq` columns.
- According to Case 2 of the query rewrite rule, these `IN` sub-queries have been transformed into `JOIN` operations. This involves creating a sub-query that aggregates the necessary columns (`d_date` and `d_month_seq`) and then joining this result with the main query using an `INNER JOIN`.
- The transformation ensures that the filtering logic remains the same, but the execution plan is optimized by using joins instead of sub-queries, which can be more efficient in certain database systems.
- This transformation is applied consistently across all three CTEs (`sr_items`, `cr_items`, `wr_items`), ensuring uniform optimization of the query.
Query 5: The SQL query contains subqueries with `IN` predicates, which can be optimized using semi-join transformations as suggested by Rule 1. The subqueries in the `store_returns`, `catalog_returns`, and `web_returns` CTEs filter dates based on month sequences. By applying semi-join optimizations, the query can potentially reduce the result set size earlier in the processing. This can be achieved by transforming the subqueries into JOINs that discard non-matching rows earlier, possibly by pulling relevant data into a temporary structure or scanning data in a manner that avoids processing duplicate information unnecessarily. This transformation aligns with the conditions and transformations outlined in Rule 1, focusing on optimizing the use of `IN` predicates within subqueries.
Query 6: The query uses `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY`, which matches the conditions for Rule 4. The transformation involves optimizing the sorting and limiting operations by encouraging the database engine to stop the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained, avoiding full table sorts. This optimization can be achieved by ensuring that the `ORDER BY` clause leverages indexed columns, if available, to reduce the cost associated with sorting and filtering operations. However, since the `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT` are already appropriately used in the query, the transformation may not significantly alter the query structure but can enhance performance by ensuring efficient execution of these operations.

"""The SQL query changes can be explained by Case 1 of the query rewrite rule. The original query had filter conditions applied after the joins, which could be logically associated with columns from one side of the join. By moving these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOINs, the query optimizer can potentially reduce the size of the datasets before performing the join operations. This transformation improves query efficiency by filtering data earlier in the execution plan, thus reducing the amount of data processed in subsequent operations. The detailed changes, such as moving conditions like `sr_item_sk = i_item_sk` into the join conditions, illustrate this optimization process."""

Query Rewrite 2:
"""In Case 1, the rewrite rule applies the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions directly to the data sources referred to in the `FROM` clause of the inner query before the projection. The outer projection layer is eliminated if it only renames the columns without transforming them. In the given SQL query, the `LogicalProject` nodes that were used to rename columns after aggregation have been removed, and the `LogicalAggregate` nodes now directly use the columns from the data sources. This results in a more efficient query execution plan by reducing unnecessary intermediate steps and directly applying the necessary operations to the data sources."""

Query Rewrite 3:
"""In this query rewrite process, the SQL query's WHERE clause conditions involving `BETWEEN` and `IN` operators have been simplified into search arguments (SARGs). This transformation is a logical simplification that enhances query performance by allowing the database engine to use more efficient index-based searches. The conditions `i_manager_id BETWEEN 47 and 56` and `sr_reason_sk in (9, 13, 26, 40, 44)` in the `store_returns` subquery, as well as similar conditions in the `catalog_returns` and `web_returns` subqueries, have been rewritten to `SEARCH($40(i_manager_id), Sarg[[47..56]])` and `SEARCH($8(sr_reason_sk), Sarg[9, 13, 26, 40, 44])`, respectively. This optimization reduces the complexity of the query and improves its execution efficiency."""

Query Rewrite 4:
"""The SQL query changes can be explained as follows:
- The original query used `IN` sub-queries to filter dates based on specific conditions. These sub-queries were correlated with the outer query through the `d_date` and `d_month_seq` columns.
- According to Case 2 of the query rewrite rule, these `IN` sub-queries have been transformed into `JOIN` operations. This involves creating a sub-query that aggregates the necessary columns (`d_date` and `d_month_seq`) and then joining this result with the main query using an `INNER JOIN`.
- The transformation ensures that the filtering logic remains the same, but the execution plan is optimized by using joins instead of sub-queries, which can be more efficient in certain database systems.
- This transformation is applied consistently across all three CTEs (`sr_items`, `cr_items`, `wr_items`), ensuring uniform optimization of the query."""

Query Rewrite 5:
"""The SQL query contains subqueries with `IN` predicates, which can be optimized using semi-join transformations as suggested by Rule 1. The subqueries in the `store_returns`, `catalog_returns`, and `web_returns` CTEs filter dates based on month sequences. By applying semi-join optimizations, the query can potentially reduce the result set size earlier in the processing. This can be achieved by transforming the subqueries into JOINs that discard non-matching rows earlier, possibly by pulling relevant data into a temporary structure or scanning data in a manner that avoids processing duplicate information unnecessarily. This transformation aligns with the conditions and transformations outlined in Rule 1, focusing on optimizing the use of `IN` predicates within subqueries."""

Query Rewrite 6:
"""The query uses `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY`, which matches the conditions for Rule 4. The transformation involves optimizing the sorting and limiting operations by encouraging the database engine to stop the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained, avoiding full table sorts. This optimization can be achieved by ensuring that the `ORDER BY` clause leverages indexed columns, if available, to reduce the cost associated with sorting and filtering operations. However, since the `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT` are already appropriately used in the query, the transformation may not significantly alter the query structure but can enhance performance by ensuring efficient execution of these operations."""

The original query had filter conditions applied after the joins, which could be logically associated with columns from one side of the join. By moving these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOINs, the query optimizer can potentially reduce the size of the datasets before performing the join operations. This transformation improves query efficiency by filtering data earlier in the execution plan, thus reducing the amount of data processed in subsequent operations. The detailed changes, such as moving conditions like `sr_item_sk = i_item_sk` into the join conditions, illustrate this optimization process."""\n\nQuery Rewrite 2:\n"""In Case 1, the rewrite rule applies the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions directly to the data sources referred to in the `FROM` clause of the inner query before the projection. The outer projection layer is eliminated if it only renames the columns without transforming them. In the given SQL query, the `LogicalProject` nodes that were used to rename columns after aggregation have been removed, and the `LogicalAggregate` nodes now directly use the columns from the data sources. This results in a more efficient query execution plan by reducing unnecessary intermediate steps and directly applying the necessary operations to the data sources."""\n\nQuery Rewrite 3:\n"""In this query rewrite process, the SQL query\'s WHERE clause conditions involving `BETWEEN` and `IN` operators have been simplified into search arguments (SARGs). This transformation is a logical simplification that enhances query performance by allowing the database engine to use more efficient index-based searches. The conditions `i_manager_id BETWEEN 47 and 56` and `sr_reason_sk in (9, 13, 26, 40, 44)` in the `store_returns` subquery, as well as similar conditions in the `catalog_returns` and `web_returns` subqueries, have been rewritten to `SEARCH($40(i_manager_id), Sarg[[47..56]])` and `SEARCH($8(sr_reason_sk), Sarg[9, 13, 26, 40, 44])`, respectively. This optimization reduces the complexity of the query and improves its execution efficiency."""\n\nQuery Rewrite 4:\n"""The SQL query changes can be explained as follows:\n- The original query used `IN` sub-queries to filter dates based on specific conditions. These sub-queries were correlated with the outer query through the `d_date` and `d_month_seq` columns.\n- According to Case 2 of the query rewrite rule, these `IN` sub-queries have been transformed into `JOIN` operations. This involves creating a sub-query that aggregates the necessary columns (`d_date` and `d_month_seq`) and then joining this result with the main query using an `INNER JOIN`.\n- The transformation ensures that the filtering logic remains the same, but the execution plan is optimized by using joins instead of sub-queries, which can be more efficient in certain database systems.\n- This transformation is applied consistently across all three CTEs (`sr_items`, `cr_items`, `wr_items`), ensuring uniform optimization of the query."""\n\nQuery Rewrite 5:\n"""The SQL query contains subqueries with `IN` predicates, which can be optimized using semi-join transformations as suggested by Rule 1. The subqueries in the `store_returns`, `catalog_returns`, and `web_returns` CTEs filter dates based on month sequences. By applying semi-join optimizations, the query can potentially reduce the result set size earlier in the processing. This can be achieved by transforming the subqueries into JOINs that discard non-matching rows earlier, possibly by pulling relevant data into a temporary structure or scanning data in a manner that avoids processing duplicate information unnecessarily. This transformation aligns with the conditions and transformations outlined in Rule 1, focusing on optimizing the use of `IN` predicates within subqueries."""\n\nQuery Rewrite 6:\n"""The query uses `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY`, which matches the conditions for Rule 4. The transformation involves optimizing the sorting and limiting operations by encouraging the database engine to stop the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained, avoiding full table sorts. This optimization can be achieved by ensuring that the `ORDER BY` clause leverages indexed columns, if available, to reduce the cost associated with sorting and filtering operations. However, since the `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT` are already appropriately used in the query, the transformation may not significantly alter the query structure but can enhance performance by ensuring efficient execution of these operations."""'}], 'response': "To cluster the provided query rewrite strategies, we can group them based on the type of optimization or transformation they focus on.

The filter's expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there's a matching row in the non-preserving side's table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned."}, {'name': 'AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE', 'rewrite': 'Case 1:\n**Conditions**: - The SQL query contains a `GROUP BY` clause that groups by simple columns (no expressions in the `GROUP BY` list).\n- The aggregate functions in the `SELECT` clause operate directly on columns (no expressions inside the aggregate functions).\n- The `SELECT` clause only contains the columns used in the `GROUP BY` clause and the aggregates without any transformations or additional expressions.\n**Transformations**: - Directly apply the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions to the data source referred to in the `FROM` clause of the inner query before the projection.\n- Eliminate the outer projection layer if it only renames the columns without transforming them.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: - The `SELECT` clause of an outer query precisely matches the columns used in the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions of an inner query, without any column transformations or renamings.\n- The inner `SELECT` only serves as a passthrough for these columns.\n**Transformations**: - Remove the inner `SELECT` layer, directly applying the aggregate functions and `GROUP BY` to the original data source.'}, {'name': 'FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS', 'rewrite': "Case 1:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains conditions that can be statically determined as always true (e.g., constant expressions like `1=1` or tautologies based on the column data types and constraints), then these conditions don't affect the result set.\n**Transformations**: Remove such conditions from the WHERE clause.

Originally, the query used `IN` sub-queries to filter dates, which were correlated with the outer query through `d_date` and `d_month_seq` columns. By transforming these into `JOIN` operations, the query maintains the same filtering logic but benefits from a potentially more efficient execution plan, as joins can be more performant in certain database systems. This transformation is applied uniformly across all three common table expressions (CTEs) in the query, ensuring consistent optimization."""\n\n### Suggestion 4:\n"""The SQL query contains subqueries with `IN` predicates, which can be optimized using semi-join transformations as suggested by Rule 1. The subqueries in the `store_returns`, `catalog_returns`, and `web_returns` CTEs filter dates based on month sequences. By applying semi-join optimizations, the query can potentially reduce the result set size earlier in the processing. This can be achieved by transforming the subqueries into JOINs that discard non-matching rows earlier, possibly by pulling relevant data into a temporary structure or scanning data in a manner that avoids processing duplicate information unnecessarily. This transformation aligns with the conditions and transformations outlined in Rule 1, focusing on optimizing the use of `IN` predicates within subqueries."""\n\n### Suggestion 5:\n"""The query uses `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY`, which matches the conditions for Rule 4. The transformation involves optimizing the sorting and limiting operations by encouraging the database engine to stop the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained, avoiding full table sorts. This optimization can be achieved by ensuring that the `ORDER BY` clause leverages indexed columns, if available, to reduce the cost associated with sorting and filtering operations. However, since the `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT` are already appropriately used in the query, the transformation may not significantly alter the query structure but can enhance performance by ensuring efficient execution of these operations."""\n\nQuery Rewrite Rules:\n### Rule FILTER_INTO_JOIN:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: This SQL query rewrite rule applies when a filter condition is placed on the result set of an INNER JOIN operation. The filter\'s expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there\'s a matching row in the non-preserving side\'s table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned."""\n\n### Rule AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: - The SQL query contains a `GROUP BY` clause that groups by simple columns (no expressions in the `GROUP BY` list).\n- The aggregate functions in the `SELECT` clause operate directly on columns (no expressions inside the aggregate functions).\n- The `SELECT` clause only contains the columns used in the `GROUP BY` clause and the aggregates without any transformations or additional expressions.\n**Transformations**: - Directly apply the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions to the data source referred to in the `FROM` clause of the inner query before the projection.\n- Eliminate the outer projection layer if it only renames the columns without transforming them.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: - The `SELECT` clause of an outer query precisely matches the columns used in the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions of an inner query, without any column transformations or renamings.\n- The inner `SELECT` only serves as a passthrough for these columns.\n**Transformations**: - Remove the inner `SELECT` layer, directly applying the aggregate functions and `GROUP BY` to the original data source."""\n\n### Rule FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains conditions that can be statically determined as always true (e.g., constant expressions like `1=1` or tautologies based on the column data types and constraints), then these conditions don\'t affect the result set.\n**Transformations**: Remove such conditions from the WHERE clause. If this results in an empty WHERE clause, remove the WHERE clause entirely.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause simplifies to conditions that are always false or involve comparisons with NULL in a way that the outcome is always false or NULL (e.g., `column != column` or `1=0`), indicating no rows can satisfy the filter.\n**Transformations**: Replace the query with one that selects no rows. This could be represented in different ways based on the SQL dialect. One universal method might be selecting from a dual table with a false condition.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains complex conditions that can be simplified based on known constraints, constants, or through logical simplification (e.g., `column IS NOT NULL AND column IS NOT NULL` simplifies to `column IS NOT NULL`).\n**Transformations**: Simplify the conditions according to logical rules and known constraints. Remove redundancy and unnecessary complexity."""\n\n### Rule FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: The query contains a scalar sub-query within the WHERE clause.\n**Transformations**: The scalar sub-query should be transformed into a LEFT JOIN operation with an aggregate function on the column(s) being selected in the sub-query. The JOIN condition uses the correlation ID (the matching column(s) in both outer and sub-query).\n  - Original Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 WHERE column = (SELECT AGG_FUNCTION(column2) FROM table2 WHERE table1.join_column = table2.join_column)\n  - Transformed Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 LEFT JOIN (SELECT join_column, AGG_FUNCTION(column2) AS agg_result FROM table2 GROUP BY join_column) AS sub_query ON table1.join_column = sub_query.join_column WHERE column = sub_query.agg_result\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: The query contains `IN`, `EXISTS`, or `UNIQUE` sub-queries within the WHERE clause that are correlated with the outer query.\n**Transformations**: - For `IN` Sub-queries: Replace the `IN` clause with a JOIN operation and a WHERE condition that checks for non-null values on the side of the sub-query.\n    - Original Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 WHERE column IN (SELECT column2 FROM table2 WHERE table1.join_column = table2.join_column)\n    - Transformed Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.join_column = table2.join_column WHERE table2.column2 IS NOT NULL\n  - For `EXISTS` Sub-queries: Convert the `EXISTS` condition into a JOIN operation, using WHERE to filter rows that match the JOIN condition.\n    - Original Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM table2 WHERE table1.join_column = table2.join_class)\n    - Transformed Query Structure: SELECT DISTINCT table1.* FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.join_column = table2.join_column\n  - For `UNIQUE` Sub-queries: Since `UNIQUE` requires a bit more complex handling not directly mappable to a standard JOIN, it should be considered a special case where the goal is to ensure that rows from the outer query match a unique set in the sub-query. This might not translate directly into SQL syntax without additional sub-query or DISTINCT aggregation."""\n\n### Rule SORT_PROJECT_TRANSPOSE:\n"""**Conditions**: If a SQL query executes a sort operation on columns that are directly referenced in the SELECT list or through expressions that are strictly monotonic transformations of these columns, and the sort operation directly follows these projections (SELECT statements), the sort operation can be pushed to operate directly on the table (FROM clause) before the projection.\n**Transformations**: 1. Check Compatibility: Ensure both sort and project (SELECT and ORDER BY clauses) involve compatible operations that relate directly to the raw column data or involve monotonic transformations.\n2. Analyze Order By Fields: Verify that each column in the ORDER BY clause is directly represented in the SELECT list or is a derived column through a monotonic transformation (e.g., casting integers to floats where the order is preserved).\n3. Adjust SQL Query: Rewrite the query so that sorting (ORDER BY clause) is applied to the raw table data in the FROM clause rather than after the projection. This might involve introducing a subquery or CTE (Common Table Expression) where the sorting is applied first, followed by the projections.\n4. Optimize Projection: Ensure that the SELECT list in the outer query matches the original projection, applying on top of the sorted data now."""\n\n### Rule PROJECT_FILTER_TRANSPOSE:\n"""**Conditions**: This rewrite rule can be applied when an SQL query contains a SELECT operation (acting as the `Project` operation) followed by a WHERE clause (acting as the `Filter` operation), provided that the SELECT does not contain window functions (such as RANK(), ROW_NUMBER(), etc.) and the columns selected do not affect the outcome of the WHERE clause.\n**Transformations**: To apply the rule, refactor the SQL query so that the conditions in the WHERE clause are evaluated before the columns are selected in the SELECT clause. This may involve moving computations or column transformations from the SELECT clause to a sub-query that the WHERE clause is applied on, ensuring the final SELECT clause on the outermost query matches the original query\'s expected outcome. - Before: SELECT col1, transformation_function(col2) FROM table WHERE condition; - After: SELECT col1, transformation_function(col2) FROM (SELECT col1, col2 FROM table WHERE condition) AS subquery;"""\n\n### Rule AGGREGATE_REDUCE_FUNCTIONS:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: any SELECT statement or subquery using the AVG aggregate function\n**Transformations**: AVG(x) as SUM(x) / COUNT(x)\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: computing the population standard deviation\n**Transformations**: STDDEV_POP(x) as the square root of (`SUM(x^2) - SUM(x)^2 / COUNT(x)`) / COUNT(x)\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: for the sample standard deviation computation\n**Transformations**: STDDEV_SAMP(x) as the square root of (`SUM(x^2) - SUM(x)^2 / COUNT(x)`) / (COUNT(x) - 1)\nCase 4:\n**Conditions**: for the population variance computation\n**Transformations**: VAR_POP(x) as (`SUM(x^2) - SUM(x)^2 / COUNT(x)`) / COUNT(x)\nCase 5:\n**Conditions**: for the sample variance computation\n**Transformations**: VAR_SAMP(x) as (`SUM(x^2) - SUM(x)^2 / COUNT(x)`) / (COUNT(x) - 1)\nCase 6:\n**Conditions**: to compute population covariance\n**Transformations**: COVAR_POP(x, y) by applying a formula involving SUM and COUNT\nCase 7:\n**Conditions**: using a formula for sample covariance\n**Transformations**: COVAR_SAMP(x, y) using a formula involving SUM, COUNT, and an adjustment for sample calculations\nCase 8:\n**Conditions**: for transforming REGR_SXX(x, y) and REGR_SYY(x, y)\n**Transformations**: into expressions involving the computation of VAR_POP(x) or VAR_POP(y) respectively, multiplied by REGR_COUNT(x, y)"""\n\n### Rule JOIN_TO_CORRELATE:\n"""**Conditions**: The join type is either INNER JOIN or LEFT JOIN. There are no requirements in the query that would inherently create NULL values on the left side when there are no matching rows on the right side (for INNER JOIN, this condition is naturally met; for LEFT JOIN, it is met if every row on the left side has at least one corresponding row on the right side according to the join condition).\n**Transformations**: 1. Identify the INNER JOIN or LEFT JOIN condition in the SQL query. 2. Extract the ON clause representing the join condition. 3. For INNER JOIN: - Replace the INNER JOIN with a WHERE EXISTS clause, moving the original join condition into the WHERE clause of a subquery that selects from the right side table. Reference the left side columns as correlation variables in the subquery\'s WHERE clause. - Example Transformation: SELECT * FROM left_table INNER JOIN right_table ON left_table.id = right_table.foreign_id Becomes: SELECT * FROM left_table WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM right_table WHERE left_table.id = right_table.foreign_id) 4. For LEFT JOIN: - Replace the LEFT JOIN with a LEFT OUTER JOIN subquery that is correlated to the outer query. In the SELECT clause of the outer query, include a CASE statement or similar logic to handle selection from the subquery result. - Example Transformation: SELECT left_table.*, right_table.* FROM left_table LEFT JOIN right_table ON left_table.id = right_table.foreign_id Becomes: SELECT left_table.*, COALESCE(subquery.alias1, \'default\') FROM left_table LEFT OUTER JOIN (SELECT foreign_id, column1 AS alias1 FROM right_table) subquery ON left_table.id = subquery.foreign_id"""'}], 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'stream': False, 'temperature': 0.1}}

Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set.

The original query had filter conditions applied after the joins, which could be logically associated with columns from one side of the join. By moving these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOINs, the query optimizer can potentially reduce the size of the datasets before performing the join operations. This transformation improves query efficiency by filtering data earlier in the execution plan, thus reducing the amount of data processed in subsequent operations. The detailed changes, such as moving conditions like `sr_item_sk = i_item_sk` into the join conditions, illustrate this optimization process."""\n\n### Suggestion 2:\n"""In Case 1, the rewrite rule applies the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions directly to the data sources referred to in the `FROM` clause of the inner query before the projection. The outer projection layer is eliminated if it only renames the columns without transforming them. In the given SQL query, the `LogicalProject` nodes that were used to rename columns after aggregation have been removed, and the `LogicalAggregate` nodes now directly use the columns from the data sources. This results in a more efficient query execution plan by reducing unnecessary intermediate steps and directly applying the necessary operations to the data sources."""\n\n### Suggestion 3:\n"""The provided SQL query has been optimized using two main strategies. The first strategy involves transforming the WHERE clause conditions that use `BETWEEN` and `IN` operators into search arguments (SARGs), which allows the database engine to perform more efficient index-based searches. Specifically, conditions like `i_manager_id BETWEEN 47 and 56` and `sr_reason_sk in (9, 13, 26, 40, 44)` have been rewritten to use SARGs, reducing query complexity and enhancing execution efficiency. The second strategy involves replacing `IN` sub-queries with `JOIN` operations. Originally, the query used `IN` sub-queries to filter dates, which were correlated with the outer query through `d_date` and `d_month_seq` columns. By transforming these into `JOIN` operations, the query maintains the same filtering logic but benefits from a potentially more efficient execution plan, as joins can be more performant in certain database systems. This transformation is applied uniformly across all three common table expressions (CTEs) in the query, ensuring consistent optimization."""\n\n### Suggestion 4:\n"""The SQL query contains subqueries with `IN` predicates, which can be optimized using semi-join transformations as suggested by Rule 1. The subqueries in the `store_returns`, `catalog_returns`, and `web_returns` CTEs filter dates based on month sequences. By applying semi-join optimizations, the query can potentially reduce the result set size earlier in the processing. This can be achieved by transforming the subqueries into JOINs that discard non-matching rows earlier, possibly by pulling relevant data into a temporary structure or scanning data in a manner that avoids processing duplicate information unnecessarily. This transformation aligns with the conditions and transformations outlined in Rule 1, focusing on optimizing the use of `IN` predicates within subqueries."""\n\n### Suggestion 5:\n"""The query uses `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY`, which matches the conditions for Rule 4. The transformation involves optimizing the sorting and limiting operations by encouraging the database engine to stop the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained, avoiding full table sorts. This optimization can be achieved by ensuring that the `ORDER BY` clause leverages indexed columns, if available, to reduce the cost associated with sorting and filtering operations. However, since the `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT` are already appropriately used in the query, the transformation may not significantly alter the query structure but can enhance performance by ensuring efficient execution of these operations."""\n\nQuery Rewrite Rule Sets:\n### AGGREGATE Operator Rules: ["AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE"]\n\n### CORRELATE Operator Rules: ["FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE"]\n\n### FILTER Operator Rules: ["FILTER_INTO_JOIN", "FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS", "FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE"]\n\n### JOIN Operator Rules: ["FILTER_INTO_JOIN"]\n\n### PROJECT Operator Rules: ["AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE", "SORT_PROJECT_TRANSPOSE"]\n\n### SORT Operator Rules: ["SORT_PROJECT_TRANSPOSE"]\n\nQuery Rewrite Rule Explanations:\n### Rule FILTER_INTO_JOIN:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: This SQL query rewrite rule applies when a filter condition is placed on the result set of an INNER JOIN operation.

Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN.

The original query had filter conditions applied after the joins, which could be logically associated with columns from one side of the join. By moving these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOINs, the query optimizer can potentially reduce the size of the datasets before performing the join operations. This transformation improves query efficiency by filtering data earlier in the execution plan, thus reducing the amount of data processed in subsequent operations. The detailed changes, such as moving conditions like `sr_item_sk = i_item_sk` into the join conditions, illustrate this optimization process."""\n\n### Suggestion 2:\n"""In Case 1, the rewrite rule applies the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions directly to the data sources referred to in the `FROM` clause of the inner query before the projection. The outer projection layer is eliminated if it only renames the columns without transforming them. In the given SQL query, the `LogicalProject` nodes that were used to rename columns after aggregation have been removed, and the `LogicalAggregate` nodes now directly use the columns from the data sources. This results in a more efficient query execution plan by reducing unnecessary intermediate steps and directly applying the necessary operations to the data sources."""\n\n### Suggestion 3:\n"""The provided SQL query has been optimized using two main strategies. The first strategy involves transforming the WHERE clause conditions that use `BETWEEN` and `IN` operators into search arguments (SARGs), which allows the database engine to perform more efficient index-based searches. Specifically, conditions like `i_manager_id BETWEEN 47 and 56` and `sr_reason_sk in (9, 13, 26, 40, 44)` have been rewritten to use SARGs, reducing query complexity and enhancing execution efficiency. The second strategy involves replacing `IN` sub-queries with `JOIN` operations. Originally, the query used `IN` sub-queries to filter dates, which were correlated with the outer query through `d_date` and `d_month_seq` columns. By transforming these into `JOIN` operations, the query maintains the same filtering logic but benefits from a potentially more efficient execution plan, as joins can be more performant in certain database systems. This transformation is applied uniformly across all three common table expressions (CTEs) in the query, ensuring consistent optimization."""\n\n### Suggestion 4:\n"""The SQL query contains subqueries with `IN` predicates, which can be optimized using semi-join transformations as suggested by Rule 1. The subqueries in the `store_returns`, `catalog_returns`, and `web_returns` CTEs filter dates based on month sequences. By applying semi-join optimizations, the query can potentially reduce the result set size earlier in the processing. This can be achieved by transforming the subqueries into JOINs that discard non-matching rows earlier, possibly by pulling relevant data into a temporary structure or scanning data in a manner that avoids processing duplicate information unnecessarily. This transformation aligns with the conditions and transformations outlined in Rule 1, focusing on optimizing the use of `IN` predicates within subqueries."""\n\n### Suggestion 5:\n"""The query uses `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY`, which matches the conditions for Rule 4. The transformation involves optimizing the sorting and limiting operations by encouraging the database engine to stop the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained, avoiding full table sorts. This optimization can be achieved by ensuring that the `ORDER BY` clause leverages indexed columns, if available, to reduce the cost associated with sorting and filtering operations. However, since the `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT` are already appropriately used in the query, the transformation may not significantly alter the query structure but can enhance performance by ensuring efficient execution of these operations."""\n\nQuery Rewrite Rule Sets:\n### AGGREGATE Operator Rules: ["AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE"]\n\n### CORRELATE Operator Rules: ["FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE"]\n\n### FILTER Operator Rules: ["FILTER_INTO_JOIN", "FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS", "FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE"]\n\n### JOIN Operator Rules: ["FILTER_INTO_JOIN"]\n\n### PROJECT Operator Rules: ["AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE", "SORT_PROJECT_TRANSPOSE"]\n\n### SORT Operator Rules: ["SORT_PROJECT_TRANSPOSE"]\n\nQuery Rewrite Rule Explanations:\n### Rule FILTER_INTO_JOIN:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: This SQL query rewrite rule applies when a filter condition is placed on the result set of an INNER JOIN operation. The filter\'s expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there\'s a matching row in the non-preserving side\'s table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned."""\n\n### Rule AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: - The SQL query contains a `GROUP BY` clause that groups by simple columns (no expressions in the `GROUP BY` list).\n- The aggregate functions in the `SELECT` clause operate directly on columns (no expressions inside the aggregate functions).\n- The `SELECT` clause only contains the columns used in the `GROUP BY` clause and the aggregates without any transformations or additional expressions.\n**Transformations**: - Directly apply the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions to the data source referred to in the `FROM` clause of the inner query before the projection.\n- Eliminate the outer projection layer if it only renames the columns without transforming them.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: - The `SELECT` clause of an outer query precisely matches the columns used in the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions of an inner query, without any column transformations or renamings.\n- The inner `SELECT` only serves as a passthrough for these columns.\n**Transformations**: - Remove the inner `SELECT` layer, directly applying the aggregate functions and `GROUP BY` to the original data source."""\n\n### Rule FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains conditions that can be statically determined as always true (e.g., constant expressions like `1=1` or tautologies based on the column data types and constraints), then these conditions don\'t affect the result set.\n**Transformations**: Remove such conditions from the WHERE clause. If this results in an empty WHERE clause, remove the WHERE clause entirely.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause simplifies to conditions that are always false or involve comparisons with NULL in a way that the outcome is always false or NULL (e.g., `column != column` or `1=0`), indicating no rows can satisfy the filter.\n**Transformations**: Replace the query with one that selects no rows. This could be represented in different ways based on the SQL dialect. One universal method might be selecting from a dual table with a false condition.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains complex conditions that can be simplified based on known constraints, constants, or through logical simplification (e.g., `column IS NOT NULL AND column IS NOT NULL` simplifies to `column IS NOT NULL`).\n**Transformations**: Simplify the conditions according to logical rules and known constraints. Remove redundancy and unnecessary complexity."""\n\n### Rule FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: The query contains a scalar sub-query within the WHERE clause.\n**Transformations**: The scalar sub-query should be transformed into a LEFT JOIN operation with an aggregate function on the column(s) being selected in the sub-query. The JOIN condition uses the correlation ID (the matching column(s) in both outer and sub-query).\n  - Original Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 WHERE column = (SELECT AGG_FUNCTION(column2) FROM table2 WHERE table1.join_column = table2.join_column)\n  - Transformed Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 LEFT JOIN (SELECT join_column, AGG_FUNCTION(column2) AS agg_result FROM table2 GROUP BY join_column) AS sub_query ON table1.join_column = sub_query.join_column WHERE column = sub_query.agg_result\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: The query contains `IN`, `EXISTS`, or `UNIQUE` sub-queries within the WHERE clause that are correlated with the outer query.\n**Transformations**: - For `IN` Sub-queries: Replace the `IN` clause with a JOIN operation and a WHERE condition that checks for non-null values on the side of the sub-query.\n    - Original Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 WHERE column IN (SELECT column2 FROM table2 WHERE table1.join_column = table2.join_column)\n    - Transformed Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.join_column = table2.join_column WHERE table2.column2 IS NOT NULL\n  - For `EXISTS` Sub-queries: Convert the `EXISTS` condition into a JOIN operation, using WHERE to filter rows that match the JOIN condition.\n    - Original Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM table2 WHERE table1.join_column = table2.join_class)\n    - Transformed Query Structure: SELECT DISTINCT table1.* FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.join_column = table2.join_column\n  - For `UNIQUE` Sub-queries: Since `UNIQUE` requires a bit more complex handling not directly mappable to a standard JOIN, it should be considered a special case where the goal is to ensure that rows from the outer query match a unique set in the sub-query. This might not translate directly into SQL syntax without additional sub-query or DISTINCT aggregation."""\n\n### Rule SORT_PROJECT_TRANSPOSE:\n"""**Conditions**: If a SQL query executes a sort operation on columns that are directly referenced in the SELECT list or through expressions that are strictly monotonic transformations of these columns, and the sort operation directly follows these projections (SELECT statements), the sort operation can be pushed to operate directly on the table (FROM clause) before the projection.\n**Transformations**: 1. Check Compatibility: Ensure both sort and project (SELECT and ORDER BY clauses) involve compatible operations that relate directly to the raw column data or involve monotonic transformations.\n2. Analyze Order By Fields: Verify that each column in the ORDER BY clause is directly represented in the SELECT list or is a derived column through a monotonic transformation (e.g., casting integers to floats where the order is preserved).\n3. Adjust SQL Query: Rewrite the query so that sorting (ORDER BY clause) is applied to the raw table data in the FROM clause rather than after the projection. This might involve introducing a subquery or CTE (Common Table Expression) where the sorting is applied first, followed by the projections.\n4. Optimize Projection: Ensure that the SELECT list in the outer query matches the original projection, applying on top of the sorted data now."""'}], 'response': 'Step 1: To align the query rewrite rules with the provided suggestions, we need to analyze each suggestion and match it with the relevant rule set.

The second strategy involves replacing `IN` sub-queries with `JOIN` operations. Originally, the query used `IN` sub-queries to filter dates, which were correlated with the outer query through `d_date` and `d_month_seq` columns. By transforming these into `JOIN` operations, the query maintains the same filtering logic but benefits from a potentially more efficient execution plan, as joins can be more performant in certain database systems. This transformation is applied uniformly across all three common table expressions (CTEs) in the query, ensuring consistent optimization."""\n\n### Suggestion 4:\n"""The SQL query contains subqueries with `IN` predicates, which can be optimized using semi-join transformations as suggested by Rule 1. The subqueries in the `store_returns`, `catalog_returns`, and `web_returns` CTEs filter dates based on month sequences. By applying semi-join optimizations, the query can potentially reduce the result set size earlier in the processing. This can be achieved by transforming the subqueries into JOINs that discard non-matching rows earlier, possibly by pulling relevant data into a temporary structure or scanning data in a manner that avoids processing duplicate information unnecessarily. This transformation aligns with the conditions and transformations outlined in Rule 1, focusing on optimizing the use of `IN` predicates within subqueries."""\n\n### Suggestion 5:\n"""The query uses `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY`, which matches the conditions for Rule 4. The transformation involves optimizing the sorting and limiting operations by encouraging the database engine to stop the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained, avoiding full table sorts. This optimization can be achieved by ensuring that the `ORDER BY` clause leverages indexed columns, if available, to reduce the cost associated with sorting and filtering operations. However, since the `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT` are already appropriately used in the query, the transformation may not significantly alter the query structure but can enhance performance by ensuring efficient execution of these operations."""\n\nQuery Rewrite Rules:\n### Rule FILTER_INTO_JOIN:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: This SQL query rewrite rule applies when a filter condition is placed on the result set of an INNER JOIN operation. The filter\'s expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there\'s a matching row in the non-preserving side\'s table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned."""\n\n### Rule AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: - The SQL query contains a `GROUP BY` clause that groups by simple columns (no expressions in the `GROUP BY` list).\n- The aggregate functions in the `SELECT` clause operate directly on columns (no expressions inside the aggregate functions).\n- The `SELECT` clause only contains the columns used in the `GROUP BY` clause and the aggregates without any transformations or additional expressions.\n**Transformations**: - Directly apply the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions to the data source referred to in the `FROM` clause of the inner query before the projection.\n- Eliminate the outer projection layer if it only renames the columns without transforming them.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: - The `SELECT` clause of an outer query precisely matches the columns used in the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions of an inner query, without any column transformations or renamings.\n- The inner `SELECT` only serves as a passthrough for these columns.\n**Transformations**: - Remove the inner `SELECT` layer, directly applying the aggregate functions and `GROUP BY` to the original data source."""\n\n### Rule FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains conditions that can be statically determined as always true (e.g., constant expressions like `1=1` or tautologies based on the column data types and constraints), then these conditions don\'t affect the result set.\n**Transformations**: Remove such conditions from the WHERE clause. If this results in an empty WHERE clause, remove the WHERE clause entirely.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause simplifies to conditions that are always false or involve comparisons with NULL in a way that the outcome is always false or NULL (e.g., `column != column` or `1=0`), indicating no rows can satisfy the filter.\n**Transformations**: Replace the query with one that selects no rows. This could be represented in different ways based on the SQL dialect. One universal method might be selecting from a dual table with a false condition.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains complex conditions that can be simplified based on known constraints, constants, or through logical simplification (e.g., `column IS NOT NULL AND column IS NOT NULL` simplifies to `column IS NOT NULL`).\n**Transformations**: Simplify the conditions according to logical rules and known constraints. Remove redundancy and unnecessary complexity."""\n\n### Rule FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: The query contains a scalar sub-query within the WHERE clause.\n**Transformations**: The scalar sub-query should be transformed into a LEFT JOIN operation with an aggregate function on the column(s) being selected in the sub-query. The JOIN condition uses the correlation ID (the matching column(s) in both outer and sub-query).\n  - Original Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 WHERE column = (SELECT AGG_FUNCTION(column2) FROM table2 WHERE table1.join_column = table2.join_column)\n  - Transformed Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 LEFT JOIN (SELECT join_column, AGG_FUNCTION(column2) AS agg_result FROM table2 GROUP BY join_column) AS sub_query ON table1.join_column = sub_query.join_column WHERE column = sub_query.agg_result\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: The query contains `IN`, `EXISTS`, or `UNIQUE` sub-queries within the WHERE clause that are correlated with the outer query.\n**Transformations**: - For `IN` Sub-queries: Replace the `IN` clause with a JOIN operation and a WHERE condition that checks for non-null values on the side of the sub-query.\n    - Original Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 WHERE column IN (SELECT column2 FROM table2 WHERE table1.join_column = table2.join_column)\n    - Transformed Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.join_column = table2.join_column WHERE table2.column2 IS NOT NULL\n  - For `EXISTS` Sub-queries: Convert the `EXISTS` condition into a JOIN operation, using WHERE to filter rows that match the JOIN condition.\n    - Original Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM table2 WHERE table1.join_column = table2.join_class)\n    - Transformed Query Structure: SELECT DISTINCT table1.* FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.join_column = table2.join_column\n  - For `UNIQUE` Sub-queries: Since `UNIQUE` requires a bit more complex handling not directly mappable to a standard JOIN, it should be considered a special case where the goal is to ensure that rows from the outer query match a unique set in the sub-query. This might not translate directly into SQL syntax without additional sub-query or DISTINCT aggregation."""\n\n### Rule SORT_PROJECT_TRANSPOSE:\n"""**Conditions**: If a SQL query executes a sort operation on columns that are directly referenced in the SELECT list or through expressions that are strictly monotonic transformations of these columns, and the sort operation directly follows these projections (SELECT statements), the sort operation can be pushed to operate directly on the table (FROM clause) before the projection.\n**Transformations**: 1. Check Compatibility: Ensure both sort and project (SELECT and ORDER BY clauses) involve compatible operations that relate directly to the raw column data or involve monotonic transformations.\n2. Analyze Order By Fields: Verify that each column in the ORDER BY clause is directly represented in the SELECT list or is a derived column through a monotonic transformation (e.g., casting integers to floats where the order is preserved).\n3. Adjust SQL Query: Rewrite the query so that sorting (ORDER BY clause) is applied to the raw table data in the FROM clause rather than after the projection. This might involve introducing a subquery or CTE (Common Table Expression) where the sorting is applied first, followed by the projections.\n4. Optimize Projection: Ensure that the SELECT list in the outer query matches the original projection, applying on top of the sorted data now."""\n\nRule Subset Sequences:\n### Rule Sequence 1: ["AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE"]\n\n### Rule Sequence 2: ["FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE"]\n\n### Rule Sequence 3: ["FILTER_INTO_JOIN", "FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE", "FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS"]\n\n### Rule Sequence 4: ["FILTER_INTO_JOIN"]\n\n### Rule Sequence 5: ["AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE", "SORT_PROJECT_TRANSPOSE"]\n\n### Rule Sequence 6: ["SORT_PROJECT_TRANSPOSE"]'}], 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'stream': False, 'temperature': 0.1}}

This can be achieved by transforming the subqueries into JOINs that discard non-matching rows earlier, possibly by pulling relevant data into a temporary structure or scanning data in a manner that avoids processing duplicate information unnecessarily. This transformation aligns with the conditions and transformations outlined in Rule 1, focusing on optimizing the use of `IN` predicates within subqueries."""\n\n### Suggestion 5:\n"""The query uses `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY`, which matches the conditions for Rule 4. The transformation involves optimizing the sorting and limiting operations by encouraging the database engine to stop the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained, avoiding full table sorts. This optimization can be achieved by ensuring that the `ORDER BY` clause leverages indexed columns, if available, to reduce the cost associated with sorting and filtering operations. However, since the `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT` are already appropriately used in the query, the transformation may not significantly alter the query structure but can enhance performance by ensuring efficient execution of these operations."""\n\nQuery Rewrite Rules:\n### Rule FILTER_INTO_JOIN:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: This SQL query rewrite rule applies when a filter condition is placed on the result set of an INNER JOIN operation. The filter\'s expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there\'s a matching row in the non-preserving side\'s table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned."""\n\n### Rule AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: - The SQL query contains a `GROUP BY` clause that groups by simple columns (no expressions in the `GROUP BY` list).\n- The aggregate functions in the `SELECT` clause operate directly on columns (no expressions inside the aggregate functions).\n- The `SELECT` clause only contains the columns used in the `GROUP BY` clause and the aggregates without any transformations or additional expressions.\n**Transformations**: - Directly apply the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions to the data source referred to in the `FROM` clause of the inner query before the projection.\n- Eliminate the outer projection layer if it only renames the columns without transforming them.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: - The `SELECT` clause of an outer query precisely matches the columns used in the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions of an inner query, without any column transformations or renamings.\n- The inner `SELECT` only serves as a passthrough for these columns.\n**Transformations**: - Remove the inner `SELECT` layer, directly applying the aggregate functions and `GROUP BY` to the original data source."""\n\n### Rule FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains conditions that can be statically determined as always true (e.g., constant expressions like `1=1` or tautologies based on the column data types and constraints), then these conditions don\'t affect the result set.\n**Transformations**: Remove such conditions from the WHERE clause. If this results in an empty WHERE clause, remove the WHERE clause entirely.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause simplifies to conditions that are always false or involve comparisons with NULL in a way that the outcome is always false or NULL (e.g., `column != column` or `1=0`), indicating no rows can satisfy the filter.\n**Transformations**: Replace the query with one that selects no rows. This could be represented in different ways based on the SQL dialect. One universal method might be selecting from a dual table with a false condition.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains complex conditions that can be simplified based on known constraints, constants, or through logical simplification (e.g., `column IS NOT NULL AND column IS NOT NULL` simplifies to `column IS NOT NULL`).\n**Transformations**: Simplify the conditions according to logical rules and known constraints. Remove redundancy and unnecessary complexity."""\n\n### Rule FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: The query contains a scalar sub-query within the WHERE clause.\n**Transformations**: The scalar sub-query should be transformed into a LEFT JOIN operation with an aggregate function on the column(s) being selected in the sub-query. The JOIN condition uses the correlation ID (the matching column(s) in both outer and sub-query).\n  - Original Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 WHERE column = (SELECT AGG_FUNCTION(column2) FROM table2 WHERE table1.join_column = table2.join_column)\n  - Transformed Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 LEFT JOIN (SELECT join_column, AGG_FUNCTION(column2) AS agg_result FROM table2 GROUP BY join_column) AS sub_query ON table1.join_column = sub_query.join_column WHERE column = sub_query.agg_result\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: The query contains `IN`, `EXISTS`, or `UNIQUE` sub-queries within the WHERE clause that are correlated with the outer query.\n**Transformations**: - For `IN` Sub-queries: Replace the `IN` clause with a JOIN operation and a WHERE condition that checks for non-null values on the side of the sub-query.\n    - Original Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 WHERE column IN (SELECT column2 FROM table2 WHERE table1.join_column = table2.join_column)\n    - Transformed Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.join_column = table2.join_column WHERE table2.column2 IS NOT NULL\n  - For `EXISTS` Sub-queries: Convert the `EXISTS` condition into a JOIN operation, using WHERE to filter rows that match the JOIN condition.\n    - Original Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM table2 WHERE table1.join_column = table2.join_class)\n    - Transformed Query Structure: SELECT DISTINCT table1.* FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.join_column = table2.join_column\n  - For `UNIQUE` Sub-queries: Since `UNIQUE` requires a bit more complex handling not directly mappable to a standard JOIN, it should be considered a special case where the goal is to ensure that rows from the outer query match a unique set in the sub-query. This might not translate directly into SQL syntax without additional sub-query or DISTINCT aggregation."""\n\n### Rule SORT_PROJECT_TRANSPOSE:\n"""**Conditions**: If a SQL query executes a sort operation on columns that are directly referenced in the SELECT list or through expressions that are strictly monotonic transformations of these columns, and the sort operation directly follows these projections (SELECT statements), the sort operation can be pushed to operate directly on the table (FROM clause) before the projection.\n**Transformations**: 1. Check Compatibility: Ensure both sort and project (SELECT and ORDER BY clauses) involve compatible operations that relate directly to the raw column data or involve monotonic transformations.\n2. Analyze Order By Fields: Verify that each column in the ORDER BY clause is directly represented in the SELECT list or is a derived column through a monotonic transformation (e.g., casting integers to floats where the order is preserved).\n3. Adjust SQL Query: Rewrite the query so that sorting (ORDER BY clause) is applied to the raw table data in the FROM clause rather than after the projection. This might involve introducing a subquery or CTE (Common Table Expression) where the sorting is applied first, followed by the projections.\n4. Optimize Projection: Ensure that the SELECT list in the outer query matches the original projection, applying on top of the sorted data now."""\n\nRule Subset Sequences:\n### Rule Sequence 1: ["AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE"]\n\n### Rule Sequence 2: ["FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE"]\n\n### Rule Sequence 3: ["FILTER_INTO_JOIN", "FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE", "FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS"]\n\n### Rule Sequence 4: ["FILTER_INTO_JOIN"]\n\n### Rule Sequence 5: ["AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE", "SORT_PROJECT_TRANSPOSE"]\n\n### Rule Sequence 6: ["SORT_PROJECT_TRANSPOSE"]'}], 'response': 'To optimize the given SQL query, we need to organize the query rewrite rules effectively.

The original query had filter conditions applied after the joins, which could be logically associated with columns from one side of the join. By moving these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOINs, the query optimizer can potentially reduce the size of the datasets before performing the join operations. This transformation improves query efficiency by filtering data earlier in the execution plan, thus reducing the amount of data processed in subsequent operations. The detailed changes, such as moving conditions like `sr_item_sk = i_item_sk` into the join conditions, illustrate this optimization process."""\n\n### Suggestion 2:\n"""In Case 1, the rewrite rule applies the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions directly to the data sources referred to in the `FROM` clause of the inner query before the projection. The outer projection layer is eliminated if it only renames the columns without transforming them. In the given SQL query, the `LogicalProject` nodes that were used to rename columns after aggregation have been removed, and the `LogicalAggregate` nodes now directly use the columns from the data sources. This results in a more efficient query execution plan by reducing unnecessary intermediate steps and directly applying the necessary operations to the data sources."""\n\n### Suggestion 3:\n"""The provided SQL query has been optimized using two main strategies. The first strategy involves transforming the WHERE clause conditions that use `BETWEEN` and `IN` operators into search arguments (SARGs), which allows the database engine to perform more efficient index-based searches. Specifically, conditions like `i_manager_id BETWEEN 47 and 56` and `sr_reason_sk in (9, 13, 26, 40, 44)` have been rewritten to use SARGs, reducing query complexity and enhancing execution efficiency. The second strategy involves replacing `IN` sub-queries with `JOIN` operations. Originally, the query used `IN` sub-queries to filter dates, which were correlated with the outer query through `d_date` and `d_month_seq` columns. By transforming these into `JOIN` operations, the query maintains the same filtering logic but benefits from a potentially more efficient execution plan, as joins can be more performant in certain database systems. This transformation is applied uniformly across all three common table expressions (CTEs) in the query, ensuring consistent optimization."""\n\n### Suggestion 4:\n"""The SQL query contains subqueries with `IN` predicates, which can be optimized using semi-join transformations as suggested by Rule 1. The subqueries in the `store_returns`, `catalog_returns`, and `web_returns` CTEs filter dates based on month sequences. By applying semi-join optimizations, the query can potentially reduce the result set size earlier in the processing. This can be achieved by transforming the subqueries into JOINs that discard non-matching rows earlier, possibly by pulling relevant data into a temporary structure or scanning data in a manner that avoids processing duplicate information unnecessarily. This transformation aligns with the conditions and transformations outlined in Rule 1, focusing on optimizing the use of `IN` predicates within subqueries."""\n\n### Suggestion 5:\n"""The query uses `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY`, which matches the conditions for Rule 4. The transformation involves optimizing the sorting and limiting operations by encouraging the database engine to stop the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained, avoiding full table sorts. This optimization can be achieved by ensuring that the `ORDER BY` clause leverages indexed columns, if available, to reduce the cost associated with sorting and filtering operations. However, since the `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT` are already appropriately used in the query, the transformation may not significantly alter the query structure but can enhance performance by ensuring efficient execution of these operations."""\n\nQuery Rewrite Rules:\n### Rule FILTER_INTO_JOIN:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: This SQL query rewrite rule applies when a filter condition is placed on the result set of an INNER JOIN operation. The filter\'s expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there\'s a matching row in the non-preserving side\'s table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned."""\n\n### Rule AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: - The SQL query contains a `GROUP BY` clause that groups by simple columns (no expressions in the `GROUP BY` list).\n- The aggregate functions in the `SELECT` clause operate directly on columns (no expressions inside the aggregate functions).\n- The `SELECT` clause only contains the columns used in the `GROUP BY` clause and the aggregates without any transformations or additional expressions.\n**Transformations**: - Directly apply the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions to the data source referred to in the `FROM` clause of the inner query before the projection.\n- Eliminate the outer projection layer if it only renames the columns without transforming them.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: - The `SELECT` clause of an outer query precisely matches the columns used in the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions of an inner query, without any column transformations or renamings.\n- The inner `SELECT` only serves as a passthrough for these columns.\n**Transformations**: - Remove the inner `SELECT` layer, directly applying the aggregate functions and `GROUP BY` to the original data source."""\n\n### Rule FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains conditions that can be statically determined as always true (e.g., constant expressions like `1=1` or tautologies based on the column data types and constraints), then these conditions don\'t affect the result set.\n**Transformations**: Remove such conditions from the WHERE clause. If this results in an empty WHERE clause, remove the WHERE clause entirely.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause simplifies to conditions that are always false or involve comparisons with NULL in a way that the outcome is always false or NULL (e.g., `column != column` or `1=0`), indicating no rows can satisfy the filter.\n**Transformations**: Replace the query with one that selects no rows. This could be represented in different ways based on the SQL dialect. One universal method might be selecting from a dual table with a false condition.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains complex conditions that can be simplified based on known constraints, constants, or through logical simplification (e.g., `column IS NOT NULL AND column IS NOT NULL` simplifies to `column IS NOT NULL`).\n**Transformations**: Simplify the conditions according to logical rules and known constraints. Remove redundancy and unnecessary complexity."""\n\n### Rule FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: The query contains a scalar sub-query within the WHERE clause.\n**Transformations**: The scalar sub-query should be transformed into a LEFT JOIN operation with an aggregate function on the column(s) being selected in the sub-query. The JOIN condition uses the correlation ID (the matching column(s) in both outer and sub-query).\n  - Original Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 WHERE column = (SELECT AGG_FUNCTION(column2) FROM table2 WHERE table1.join_column = table2.join_column)\n  - Transformed Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 LEFT JOIN (SELECT join_column, AGG_FUNCTION(column2) AS agg_result FROM table2 GROUP BY join_column) AS sub_query ON table1.join_column = sub_query.join_column WHERE column = sub_query.agg_result\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: The query contains `IN`, `EXISTS`, or `UNIQUE` sub-queries within the WHERE clause that are correlated with the outer query.\n**Transformations**: - For `IN` Sub-queries: Replace the `IN` clause with a JOIN operation and a WHERE condition that checks for non-null values on the side of the sub-query.\n    - Original Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 WHERE column IN (SELECT column2 FROM table2 WHERE table1.join_column = table2.join_column)\n    - Transformed Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.join_column = table2.join_column WHERE table2.column2 IS NOT NULL\n  - For `EXISTS` Sub-queries: Convert the `EXISTS` condition into a JOIN operation, using WHERE to filter rows that match the JOIN condition.\n    - Original Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM table2 WHERE table1.join_column = table2.join_class)\n    - Transformed Query Structure: SELECT DISTINCT table1.* FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.join_column = table2.join_column\n  - For `UNIQUE` Sub-queries: Since `UNIQUE` requires a bit more complex handling not directly mappable to a standard JOIN, it should be considered a special case where the goal is to ensure that rows from the outer query match a unique set in the sub-query. This might not translate directly into SQL syntax without additional sub-query or DISTINCT aggregation."""\n\n### Rule SORT_PROJECT_TRANSPOSE:\n"""**Conditions**: If a SQL query executes a sort operation on columns that are directly referenced in the SELECT list or through expressions that are strictly monotonic transformations of these columns, and the sort operation directly follows these projections (SELECT statements), the sort operation can be pushed to operate directly on the table (FROM clause) before the projection.\n**Transformations**: 1. Check Compatibility: Ensure both sort and project (SELECT and ORDER BY clauses) involve compatible operations that relate directly to the raw column data or involve monotonic transformations.\n2. Analyze Order By Fields: Verify that each column in the ORDER BY clause is directly represented in the SELECT list or is a derived column through a monotonic transformation (e.g., casting integers to floats where the order is preserved).\n3. Adjust SQL Query: Rewrite the query so that sorting (ORDER BY clause) is applied to the raw table data in the FROM clause rather than after the projection. This might involve introducing a subquery or CTE (Common Table Expression) where the sorting is applied first, followed by the projections.\n4. Optimize Projection: Ensure that the SELECT list in the outer query matches the original projection, applying on top of the sorted data now."""\n\nArranged Rule Sequence: ["FILTER_INTO_JOIN", "FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE", "FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS", "AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE", "SORT_PROJECT_TRANSPOSE"]\n\nUtilized Rules: ["FILTER_INTO_JOIN", "FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE", "FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS", "AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE", "SORT_PROJECT_TRANSPOSE"]\n\nUnutilized Rules: []'}], 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'stream': False, 'temperature': 0.1}}

The original query had filter conditions applied after the joins, which could be logically associated with columns from one side of the join. By moving these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOINs, the query optimizer can potentially reduce the size of the datasets before performing the join operations. This transformation improves query efficiency by filtering data earlier in the execution plan, thus reducing the amount of data processed in subsequent operations. The detailed changes, such as moving conditions like `sr_item_sk = i_item_sk` into the join conditions, illustrate this optimization process."""\n\n### Suggestion 2:\n"""In Case 1, the rewrite rule applies the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions directly to the data sources referred to in the `FROM` clause of the inner query before the projection. The outer projection layer is eliminated if it only renames the columns without transforming them. In the given SQL query, the `LogicalProject` nodes that were used to rename columns after aggregation have been removed, and the `LogicalAggregate` nodes now directly use the columns from the data sources. This results in a more efficient query execution plan by reducing unnecessary intermediate steps and directly applying the necessary operations to the data sources."""\n\n### Suggestion 3:\n"""The provided SQL query has been optimized using two main strategies. The first strategy involves transforming the WHERE clause conditions that use `BETWEEN` and `IN` operators into search arguments (SARGs), which allows the database engine to perform more efficient index-based searches. Specifically, conditions like `i_manager_id BETWEEN 47 and 56` and `sr_reason_sk in (9, 13, 26, 40, 44)` have been rewritten to use SARGs, reducing query complexity and enhancing execution efficiency. The second strategy involves replacing `IN` sub-queries with `JOIN` operations. Originally, the query used `IN` sub-queries to filter dates, which were correlated with the outer query through `d_date` and `d_month_seq` columns. By transforming these into `JOIN` operations, the query maintains the same filtering logic but benefits from a potentially more efficient execution plan, as joins can be more performant in certain database systems. This transformation is applied uniformly across all three common table expressions (CTEs) in the query, ensuring consistent optimization."""\n\n### Suggestion 4:\n"""The SQL query contains subqueries with `IN` predicates, which can be optimized using semi-join transformations as suggested by Rule 1. The subqueries in the `store_returns`, `catalog_returns`, and `web_returns` CTEs filter dates based on month sequences. By applying semi-join optimizations, the query can potentially reduce the result set size earlier in the processing. This can be achieved by transforming the subqueries into JOINs that discard non-matching rows earlier, possibly by pulling relevant data into a temporary structure or scanning data in a manner that avoids processing duplicate information unnecessarily. This transformation aligns with the conditions and transformations outlined in Rule 1, focusing on optimizing the use of `IN` predicates within subqueries."""\n\n### Suggestion 5:\n"""The query uses `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY`, which matches the conditions for Rule 4. The transformation involves optimizing the sorting and limiting operations by encouraging the database engine to stop the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained, avoiding full table sorts. This optimization can be achieved by ensuring that the `ORDER BY` clause leverages indexed columns, if available, to reduce the cost associated with sorting and filtering operations. However, since the `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT` are already appropriately used in the query, the transformation may not significantly alter the query structure but can enhance performance by ensuring efficient execution of these operations."""\n\nQuery Rewrite Rules:\n### Rule FILTER_INTO_JOIN:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: This SQL query rewrite rule applies when a filter condition is placed on the result set of an INNER JOIN operation. The filter\'s expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there\'s a matching row in the non-preserving side\'s table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned."""\n\n### Rule AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: - The SQL query contains a `GROUP BY` clause that groups by simple columns (no expressions in the `GROUP BY` list).\n- The aggregate functions in the `SELECT` clause operate directly on columns (no expressions inside the aggregate functions).\n- The `SELECT` clause only contains the columns used in the `GROUP BY` clause and the aggregates without any transformations or additional expressions.\n**Transformations**: - Directly apply the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions to the data source referred to in the `FROM` clause of the inner query before the projection.\n- Eliminate the outer projection layer if it only renames the columns without transforming them.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: - The `SELECT` clause of an outer query precisely matches the columns used in the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions of an inner query, without any column transformations or renamings.\n- The inner `SELECT` only serves as a passthrough for these columns.\n**Transformations**: - Remove the inner `SELECT` layer, directly applying the aggregate functions and `GROUP BY` to the original data source."""\n\n### Rule FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains conditions that can be statically determined as always true (e.g., constant expressions like `1=1` or tautologies based on the column data types and constraints), then these conditions don\'t affect the result set.\n**Transformations**: Remove such conditions from the WHERE clause. If this results in an empty WHERE clause, remove the WHERE clause entirely.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause simplifies to conditions that are always false or involve comparisons with NULL in a way that the outcome is always false or NULL (e.g., `column != column` or `1=0`), indicating no rows can satisfy the filter.\n**Transformations**: Replace the query with one that selects no rows. This could be represented in different ways based on the SQL dialect. One universal method might be selecting from a dual table with a false condition.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains complex conditions that can be simplified based on known constraints, constants, or through logical simplification (e.g., `column IS NOT NULL AND column IS NOT NULL` simplifies to `column IS NOT NULL`).\n**Transformations**: Simplify the conditions according to logical rules and known constraints. Remove redundancy and unnecessary complexity."""\n\n### Rule FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: The query contains a scalar sub-query within the WHERE clause.\n**Transformations**: The scalar sub-query should be transformed into a LEFT JOIN operation with an aggregate function on the column(s) being selected in the sub-query. The JOIN condition uses the correlation ID (the matching column(s) in both outer and sub-query).\n  - Original Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 WHERE column = (SELECT AGG_FUNCTION(column2) FROM table2 WHERE table1.join_column = table2.join_column)\n  - Transformed Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 LEFT JOIN (SELECT join_column, AGG_FUNCTION(column2) AS agg_result FROM table2 GROUP BY join_column) AS sub_query ON table1.join_column = sub_query.join_column WHERE column = sub_query.agg_result\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: The query contains `IN`, `EXISTS`, or `UNIQUE` sub-queries within the WHERE clause that are correlated with the outer query.\n**Transformations**: - For `IN` Sub-queries: Replace the `IN` clause with a JOIN operation and a WHERE condition that checks for non-null values on the side of the sub-query.\n    - Original Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 WHERE column IN (SELECT column2 FROM table2 WHERE table1.join_column = table2.join_column)\n    - Transformed Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.join_column = table2.join_column WHERE table2.column2 IS NOT NULL\n  - For `EXISTS` Sub-queries: Convert the `EXISTS` condition into a JOIN operation, using WHERE to filter rows that match the JOIN condition.\n    - Original Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM table2 WHERE table1.join_column = table2.join_class)\n    - Transformed Query Structure: SELECT DISTINCT table1.* FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.join_column = table2.join_column\n  - For `UNIQUE` Sub-queries: Since `UNIQUE` requires a bit more complex handling not directly mappable to a standard JOIN, it should be considered a special case where the goal is to ensure that rows from the outer query match a unique set in the sub-query. This might not translate directly into SQL syntax without additional sub-query or DISTINCT aggregation."""\n\n### Rule SORT_PROJECT_TRANSPOSE:\n"""**Conditions**: If a SQL query executes a sort operation on columns that are directly referenced in the SELECT list or through expressions that are strictly monotonic transformations of these columns, and the sort operation directly follows these projections (SELECT statements), the sort operation can be pushed to operate directly on the table (FROM clause) before the projection.\n**Transformations**: 1. Check Compatibility: Ensure both sort and project (SELECT and ORDER BY clauses) involve compatible operations that relate directly to the raw column data or involve monotonic transformations.\n2. Analyze Order By Fields: Verify that each column in the ORDER BY clause is directly represented in the SELECT list or is a derived column through a monotonic transformation (e.g., casting integers to floats where the order is preserved).\n3. Adjust SQL Query: Rewrite the query so that sorting (ORDER BY clause) is applied to the raw table data in the FROM clause rather than after the projection. This might involve introducing a subquery or CTE (Common Table Expression) where the sorting is applied first, followed by the projections.\n4. Optimize Projection: Ensure that the SELECT list in the outer query matches the original projection, applying on top of the sorted data now."""\n\nArranged Rule Sequence: ["FILTER_INTO_JOIN", "FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE", "FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS", "AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE", "SORT_PROJECT_TRANSPOSE"]\n\nUtilized Rules: ["FILTER_INTO_JOIN", "FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE", "FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS", "AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE", "SORT_PROJECT_TRANSPOSE"]\n\nUnutilized Rules: []'}], 'response': 'Step 1: Since there are no unutilized rules in the provided arrangement, we cannot prioritize any unutilized potential rules over the utilized ones.
