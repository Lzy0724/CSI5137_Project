Transform `(x AND y) OR z` into `(x OR z) AND (y OR z)`.\n2. Transform `(x OR y) AND z` into `(x AND z) OR (y AND z)`.\n"""\nRule 2:\n"""\n**Conditions**: The SQL query utilizes traditional filtering mechanisms such as NOT EXISTS, NOT IN, EXISTS, IN, OR within JOINs and WHERE clauses.\n**Transformations**: - Replace IN with INTERSECT for querying intersecting datasets to potentially improve index usage and query speed.\n- Rewrite conditions using the OR operator into a series of UNION ALL operations to enhance code maintainability and performance.\n- Use EXCEPT instead of NOT IN or anti-joins to minimize duplicate row processing and optimize resource use, effectively reducing execution time.\n"""\nRule 3:\n"""\n**Conditions**: The SQL query optimization rules apply under the following conditions:\n1. When the `LIMIT` clause is used to fetch a specified number of rows.\n2. When `ORDER BY` is used in conjunction with `LIMIT` to sort and limit the number of rows retrieved, particularly when sorting can leverage an index.\n3. When `DISTINCT` is used along with `LIMIT` to quickly identify and return unique rows without scanning the full dataset.\n4. During the use of `GROUP BY`, where optimization might involve sorting or traversing indexes in order to efficiently compute group values without processing the entire dataset.\n5. When sorting a specific number of rows from a single table based on non-indexed columns, utilizing in-memory sorting (`filesort`) techniques.\n**Transformations**: The specific SQL transformations that emerge from applying these optimization rules are:\n1. Combining `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY` encourages the database engine to stop the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained, avoiding full table sorts.\n2. Using `LIMIT` with `DISTINCT` leads to an early termination of the search for unique rows as soon as the needed amount is gathered, reducing time and resources spent on scanning the entire dataset.\n3. In the context of `GROUP BY`, optimizations may include indexing strategies or modifications to the way sorting is handled, such as employing `filesort` mechanisms that do not require temporary tables, ensuring that the database engine processes only the necessary data for group computations.\n4. Efficiencies are gained by encouraging the use of indexed columns with `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT`, making queries more efficient by reducing the cost associated with sorting and filtering operations.\n"""\nRule 4:\n"""\n**Conditions**: The SQL query rewrite rule applies when there are:\n- Functions or operations (especially deterministic ones) within the SELECT, WHERE, JOIN conditions, or any part of the query that is executed multiple times for the same row.\n- The presence of potentially computationally expensive operations or function calls that are not dependent on the data of the specific row and thus can be optimized.\n**Transformations**: 1. Move repeated function calls or operations outside of loops, if applicable. For example, if a function that generates a calculated value based on constants or parameters (not row-specific data) is being called in a loop, calculate the value once before the loop and store the result for reuse.\n   \n2. Replace inline functions in the SELECT or WHERE clause with a pre-calculated column if the function is deterministic and the input data does not change frequently. This might involve:\n   - Creating a temporary table that includes the results of the expensive function calls.\n   - Using a subquery or a Common Table Expression (CTE) that calculates the value once and then joins it with the main query.\n   \n3. When using aggregate functions that are called multiple times with the same parameters, consider storing the result in a variable or a temporary table, especially if the data set is large.\n\n4. Avoid using functions on indexed columns in the WHERE clause. This prevents the database from using the index efficiently. If a function must be used, consider creating a computed column that pre-calculates the function\'s result and index that column instead.\n\n5. If possible, simplify expressions and calculations to reduce their complexity and execution time. This might involve algebraic simplification or breaking down complex calculations into simpler parts that can be calculated separately and then combined.\n\nExample:\nOriginal Query:\n```sql\nSELECT id, name, expensive_function(column) as expensive_result\nFROM table\nWHERE expensive_function(column) > 100;\n```\n\nTransformed Query using a CTE:\n```sql\nWITH PreCalculated AS (\n  SELECT id, name, column, expensive_function(column) as expensive_result\n  FROM table\n)\nSELECT id, name, expensive_sel as expensive_result\nFROM PreCalculated\nWHERE expensive_result > 100;\n```\n"""\nRule 5:\n"""\n**Conditions**: The rule applies when the original SQL query performs multiple scans or joins on the same table to retrieve different attributes for certain conditions, or when the query structure results in redundant data processing and complexity that could be reduced.\n**Transformations**: - Combine multiple joins into a single join operation by using `CASE` statements to conditionally select different attributes from the table in one pass. \n- Use the `COALESCE` function in conjunction with `CASE` statements to efficiently merge conditional attributes into distinct columns based on specific criteria without the need for additional joins.\n- Optimize the selection of conditional attributes by integrating `GROUP BY` with aggregate functions like `MAX` within `CASE` statements, thus condensing the result set to only the necessary data and avoiding needless retrieval and processing steps.\n- The overall transformation leads to a single, more efficient query that accomplishes the tasks of multiple, less efficient operations, improving performance, and simplifying the query for better readability and maintenance.\n"""'}], 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'stream': False, 'temperature': 0.1}}

Specifically, the `LogicalProject` operation that was projecting `cs_ext_discount_amt` has been removed, and the `LogicalAggregate` operation now directly aggregates `cs_ext_discount_amt` using the column index `$22` instead of `$0`. This suggests that the rewrite rule has optimized the aggregation process by removing unnecessary projection layers.\n\nStep 2: Parsing the logical plan changes into SQL query changes, we observe that the `SELECT` clause originally contained a projection of `cs_ext_discount_amt` which was then aggregated using `SUM`. The rewrite has removed this projection, directly applying the `SUM` function to the `cs_ext_discount_amt` column. Additionally, the `LogicalJoin` operations remain unchanged, indicating that the join conditions and tables involved (`catalog_sales`, `item`, `date_dim`) are still part of the query.\n\nStep 3: The query rewrite rule contains two cases. Case 1 involves optimizing queries with `GROUP BY` clauses and direct aggregate functions, while Case 2 involves removing inner `SELECT` layers when the outer query matches the inner query's columns. In this scenario, the changes align with Case 2, as the outer query's `SELECT` clause directly matches the columns and aggregates of the inner query, allowing the removal of the inner projection layer.\n\nStep 4: The SQL query changes can be explained by Case 2 of the query rewrite rule. The original query had an outer `SELECT` clause that matched the columns and aggregates of an inner query, specifically the `SUM(cs_ext_discount_amt)` operation. The rewrite rule identified this pattern and removed the inner `SELECT` layer, directly applying the `SUM` function to the `cs_ext_discount_amt` column from the `catalog_sales` table. This optimization eliminates unnecessary projection and simplifies the query execution plan, improving performance without altering the query's logical outcome.", 'time': 4.735780715942383}

When the `LIMIT` clause is used to fetch a specified number of rows.\n2. When `ORDER BY` is used in conjunction with `LIMIT` to sort and limit the number of rows retrieved, particularly when sorting can leverage an index.\n3.

Using `LIMIT` with `DISTINCT` leads to an early termination of the search for unique rows as soon as the needed amount is gathered, reducing time and resources spent on scanning the entire dataset.\n3. In the context of `GROUP BY`, optimizations may include indexing strategies or modifications to the way sorting is handled, such as employing `filesort` mechanisms that do not require temporary tables, ensuring that the database engine processes only the necessary data for group computations.\n4. Efficiencies are gained by encouraging the use of indexed columns with `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT`, making queries more efficient by reducing the cost associated with sorting and filtering operations.\n"""\nRule 4:\n"""\n**Conditions**: The SQL query rewrite rule applies when there are:\n- Functions or operations (especially deterministic ones) within the SELECT, WHERE, JOIN conditions, or any part of the query that is executed multiple times for the same row.\n- The presence of potentially computationally expensive operations or function calls that are not dependent on the data of the specific row and thus can be optimized.\n**Transformations**: 1. Move repeated function calls or operations outside of loops, if applicable. For example, if a function that generates a calculated value based on constants or parameters (not row-specific data) is being called in a loop, calculate the value once before the loop and store the result for reuse.\n   \n2. Replace inline functions in the SELECT or WHERE clause with a pre-calculated column if the function is deterministic and the input data does not change frequently. This might involve:\n   - Creating a temporary table that includes the results of the expensive function calls.\n   - Using a subquery or a Common Table Expression (CTE) that calculates the value once and then joins it with the main query.\n   \n3. When using aggregate functions that are called multiple times with the same parameters, consider storing the result in a variable or a temporary table, especially if the data set is large.\n\n4. Avoid using functions on indexed columns in the WHERE clause. This prevents the database from using the index efficiently. If a function must be used, consider creating a computed column that pre-calculates the function\'s result and index that column instead.\n\n5. If possible, simplify expressions and calculations to reduce their complexity and execution time. This might involve algebraic simplification or breaking down complex calculations into simpler parts that can be calculated separately and then combined.\n\nExample:\nOriginal Query:\n```sql\nSELECT id, name, expensive_function(column) as expensive_result\nFROM table\nWHERE expensive_function(column) > 100;\n```\n\nTransformed Query using a CTE:\n```sql\nWITH PreCalculated AS (\n  SELECT id, name, column, expensive_function(column) as expensive_result\n  FROM table\n)\nSELECT id, name, expensive_sel as expensive_result\nFROM PreCalculated\nWHERE expensive_result > 100;\n```\n"""\nRule 5:\n"""\n**Conditions**: The rule applies when the original SQL query performs multiple scans or joins on the same table to retrieve different attributes for certain conditions, or when the query structure results in redundant data processing and complexity that could be reduced.\n**Transformations**: - Combine multiple joins into a single join operation by using `CASE` statements to conditionally select different attributes from the table in one pass. \n- Use the `COALESCE` function in conjunction with `CASE` statements to efficiently merge conditional attributes into distinct columns based on specific criteria without the need for additional joins.\n- Optimize the selection of conditional attributes by integrating `GROUP BY` with aggregate functions like `MAX` within `CASE` statements, thus condensing the result set to only the necessary data and avoiding needless retrieval and processing steps.\n- The overall transformation leads to a single, more efficient query that accomplishes the tasks of multiple, less efficient operations, improving performance, and simplifying the query for better readability and maintenance.\n"""'}], 'response': 'Step 1: Analyze the given SQL query against each rewrite rule\'s conditions to determine applicability.\n\n- **Rule 1**: The SQL query contains a complex `WHERE` clause with `AND`/`OR` nesting, specifically `(i_manufact_id in (15, 261, 343, 512, 683) or i_manager_id BETWEEN 25 and 54)`. This matches the condition for Rule 1, which targets complex `AND`/`OR` nesting.\n\n- **Rule 2**: The query uses `IN` within the `WHERE` clause, which matches the condition for Rule 2. However, the query does not use `NOT EXISTS`, `NOT IN`, `EXISTS`, or `EXCEPT`, and the `IN` is not used in a join context, so the transformation suggestions for `INTERSECT` or `UNION ALL` do not directly apply.\n\n- **Rule 3**: The query uses `LIMIT` in conjunction with `ORDER BY`, which matches the conditions for Rule 3. The query does not use `DISTINCT` or `GROUP BY`, so those parts of the rule do not apply.\n\n- **Rule 4**: The query contains a deterministic operation `cast(\'2001-02-05\' as date) + interval \'90\' day` that is repeated in both the main query and the subquery. This matches the condition for Rule 4, which targets repeated deterministic operations.\n\n- **Rule 5**: The query does not perform multiple scans or joins on the same table for different attributes, nor does it have redundant data processing that could be reduced by combining joins or using `CASE` statements. Therefore, Rule 5 does not apply.\n\nStep 2: Apply the transformations for each applicable rule.\n\nQuery Rewrite 1:\n```sql\n-- Original condition: (i_manufact_id in (15, 261, 343, 512, 683) or i_manager_id BETWEEN 25 and 54)\n-- Apply transformation: (x OR y) AND z into (x AND z) OR (y AND z)\n-- However, since this transformation doesn\'t directly simplify the query in this context, we can consider the transformation as a logical restructuring:\n-- (i_manufact_id = 15 OR i_manufact_id = 261 OR i_manufact_id = 343 OR i_manufact_id = 512 OR i_manufact_id = 683 OR i_manager_id BETWEEN 25 and 54)\n-- This transformation doesn\'t change the logic but makes it explicit for potential further optimization.\n```\n\nQuery Rewrite 3:\n```sql\n-- The query uses ORDER BY with LIMIT, which encourages the database engine to stop sorting once the required number of rows is obtained.\n-- This transformation is implicit in the query\'s current structure, as the ORDER BY and LIMIT are already combined.\n-- No explicit SQL transformation is needed, but the understanding is that the database engine will optimize this by stopping the sort early.\n```\n\nQuery Rewrite 4:\n```sql\n-- Original repeated operation: cast(\'2001-02-05\' as date) + interval \'90\' day\n-- Transformation: Move this operation outside of the subquery to avoid recalculating it.\nWITH DateRange AS (\n  SELECT cast(\'2001-02-05\' as date) + interval \'90\' day AS end_date\n)\nSELECT sum(cs_ext_discount_amt) as "excess discount amount"\nFROM catalog_sales, item, date_dim, DateRange\nWHERE (i_manufact_id in (15, 261, 343, 512, 683) OR i_manager_id BETWEEN 25 and 54)\nAND i_item_sk = cs_item_sk\nAND d_date BETWEEN \'2001-02-05\' AND end_date\nAND d_date_sk = cs_sold_date_sk\nAND cs_ext_discount_amt > (\n  SELECT 1.3 * avg(cs_ext_discount_amt)\n  FROM catalog_sales, date_dim, DateRange\n  WHERE cs_item_sk = i_item_sk\n  AND d_date BETWEEN \'2001-02-05\' AND end_date\n  AND d_date_sk = cs_sold_date_sk\n  AND cs_list_price BETWEEN 259 AND 288\n  AND cs_sales_price / cs_list_price BETWEEN 17 * 0.01 AND 37 * 0.01\n)\nORDER BY sum(cs_ext_discount_amt)\nLIMIT 100;\n-- This transformation reduces the repeated calculation of the date range.\n```\n\nIn summary, the applicable rules were Rule 1, Rule 3, and Rule 4. Rule 1\'s transformation was more about logical restructuring, Rule 3\'s transformation was implicit in the query\'s structure, and Rule 4\'s transformation involved moving a repeated deterministic operation outside of the subquery to optimize performance.', 'time': 7.760574817657471}

Transform `(x OR y) AND z` into `(x AND z) OR (y AND z)`.\n"""\nRule 2:\n"""\n**Conditions**: The SQL query utilizes traditional filtering mechanisms such as NOT EXISTS, NOT IN, EXISTS, IN, OR within JOINs and WHERE clauses.\n**Transformations**: - Replace IN with INTERSECT for querying intersecting datasets to potentially improve index usage and query speed.\n- Rewrite conditions using the OR operator into a series of UNION ALL operations to enhance code maintainability and performance.\n- Use EXCEPT instead of NOT IN or anti-joins to minimize duplicate row processing and optimize resource use, effectively reducing execution time.\n"""\nRule 3:\n"""\n**Conditions**: The SQL query optimization rules apply under the following conditions:\n1. When the `LIMIT` clause is used to fetch a specified number of rows.\n2. When `ORDER BY` is used in conjunction with `LIMIT` to sort and limit the number of rows retrieved, particularly when sorting can leverage an index.\n3. When `DISTINCT` is used along with `LIMIT` to quickly identify and return unique rows without scanning the full dataset.\n4. During the use of `GROUP BY`, where optimization might involve sorting or traversing indexes in order to efficiently compute group values without processing the entire dataset.\n5. When sorting a specific number of rows from a single table based on non-indexed columns, utilizing in-memory sorting (`filesort`) techniques.\n**Transformations**: The specific SQL transformations that emerge from applying these optimization rules are:\n1. Combining `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY` encourages the database engine to stop the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained, avoiding full table sorts.\n2. Using `LIMIT` with `DISTINCT` leads to an early termination of the search for unique rows as soon as the needed amount is gathered, reducing time and resources spent on scanning the entire dataset.\n3. In the context of `GROUP BY`, optimizations may include indexing strategies or modifications to the way sorting is handled, such as employing `filesort` mechanisms that do not require temporary tables, ensuring that the database engine processes only the necessary data for group computations.\n4. Efficiencies are gained by encouraging the use of indexed columns with `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT`, making queries more efficient by reducing the cost associated with sorting and filtering operations.\n"""\nRule 4:\n"""\n**Conditions**: The SQL query rewrite rule applies when there are:\n- Functions or operations (especially deterministic ones) within the SELECT, WHERE, JOIN conditions, or any part of the query that is executed multiple times for the same row.\n- The presence of potentially computationally expensive operations or function calls that are not dependent on the data of the specific row and thus can be optimized.\n**Transformations**: 1. Move repeated function calls or operations outside of loops, if applicable. For example, if a function that generates a calculated value based on constants or parameters (not row-specific data) is being called in a loop, calculate the value once before the loop and store the result for reuse.\n   \n2. Replace inline functions in the SELECT or WHERE clause with a pre-calculated column if the function is deterministic and the input data does not change frequently. This might involve:\n   - Creating a temporary table that includes the results of the expensive function calls.\n   - Using a subquery or a Common Table Expression (CTE) that calculates the value once and then joins it with the main query.\n   \n3. When using aggregate functions that are called multiple times with the same parameters, consider storing the result in a variable or a temporary table, especially if the data set is large.\n\n4. Avoid using functions on indexed columns in the WHERE clause. This prevents the database from using the index efficiently. If a function must be used, consider creating a computed column that pre-calculates the function\'s result and index that column instead.\n\n5. If possible, simplify expressions and calculations to reduce their complexity and execution time. This might involve algebraic simplification or breaking down complex calculations into simpler parts that can be calculated separately and then combined.\n\nExample:\nOriginal Query:\n```sql\nSELECT id, name, expensive_function(column) as expensive_result\nFROM table\nWHERE expensive_function(column) > 100;\n```\n\nTransformed Query using a CTE:\n```sql\nWITH PreCalculated AS (\n  SELECT id, name, column, expensive_function(column) as expensive_result\n  FROM table\n)\nSELECT id, name, expensive_sel as expensive_result\nFROM PreCalculated\nWHERE expensive_result > 100;\n```\n"""\nRule 5:\n"""\n**Conditions**: The rule applies when the original SQL query performs multiple scans or joins on the same table to retrieve different attributes for certain conditions, or when the query structure results in redundant data processing and complexity that could be reduced.\n**Transformations**: - Combine multiple joins into a single join operation by using `CASE` statements to conditionally select different attributes from the table in one pass. \n- Use the `COALESCE` function in conjunction with `CASE` statements to efficiently merge conditional attributes into distinct columns based on specific criteria without the need for additional joins.\n- Optimize the selection of conditional attributes by integrating `GROUP BY` with aggregate functions like `MAX` within `CASE` statements, thus condensing the result set to only the necessary data and avoiding needless retrieval and processing steps.\n- The overall transformation leads to a single, more efficient query that accomplishes the tasks of multiple, less efficient operations, improving performance, and simplifying the query for better readability and maintenance.\n"""'}], 'response': 'Step 1: Analyze the given SQL query against each rewrite rule\'s conditions to determine applicability.\n\n- **Rule 1**: The query contains a complex `WHERE` clause with `AND`/`OR` nesting, specifically `(i_manufact_id in (15, 261, 343, 512, 683) or i_manager_id BETWEEN 25 and 54)`.

Step 2: Apply the transformations for each applicable rule.

Query Rewrite 1:
```plaintext
The original query has a complex `WHERE` clause with `(i_manufact_id in (15, 261, 343, 512, 683) or i_manager_id BETWEEN 25 and 54)`. Applying Rule 1, we can transform this using the distributive law:
- Original: `(x OR y) AND z` becomes `(x AND z) OR (y AND z)`.
- Transformed: 
  ```sql
  (i_manufact_id in (15, 261, 343, 512, 683) AND i_item_sk = cs_item_sk AND d_date between '2001-02-05' and cast('2001-02-05' as date) + interval '90' day AND d_date_sk = cs_sold_date_sk)
  OR
  (i_manager_id BETWEEN 25 and 54 AND i_item_sk = cs_item_sk AND d_date between '2001-02-05' and cast('2001-02-05' as date) + interval '90' day AND d_date_sk = cs_sold_date_sk)
  ```
This transformation might improve the query execution plan by allowing the database to evaluate the conditions more efficiently.
```

Query Rewrite 3:
```plaintext
The query uses `ORDER BY sum(cs_ext_discount_amt) LIMIT 100`. Rule 3 suggests that combining `ORDER BY` with `LIMIT` encourages the database engine to stop sorting as soon as the required number of rows is obtained. This is already being done in the query, so no further transformation is needed. However, ensuring that `cs_ext_discount_amt` is indexed could further optimize this operation.
```

Query Rewrite 4:
```plaintext
The query uses `cast('2001-02-05' as date) + interval '90' day` multiple times. Applying Rule 4, we can calculate this value once and reuse it:
- Calculate the date range once:
  ```sql
  WITH DateRange AS (
    SELECT cast('2001-02-05' as date) + interval '90' day AS end_date
  )
  ```
- Use `DateRange.end_date` in the main query:
  ```sql
  select sum(cs_ext_discount_amt) as "excess discount amount"
  from catalog_sales, item, date_dim, DateRange
  where (i_manufact_id in (15, 261, 343, 512, 683) or i_manager_id BETWEEN 25 and 54)
  and i_item_sk = cs_item_sk
  and d_date between '2001-02-05' and DateRange.end_date
  and d_date_sk = cs_sold_date_sk
  and cs_ext_discount_amt > (
    select 1.3 * avg(cs_ext_discount_amt)
    from catalog_sales, date_dim, DateRange
    where cs_item_sk = i_item_sk
    and d_date between '2001-02-05' and DateRange.end_date
    and d_date_sk = cs_sold_date_sk
    and cs_list_price between 259 and 288
    and cs_sales_price / cs_list_price BETWEEN 17 * 0.01 AND 37 * 0.01
  )
  order by sum(cs_ext_discount_amt)
  limit 100;
  ```
This reduces the computational overhead by calculating the date range once.
```
05:29:09,640 root INFO Generated queries:
Query 1: The SQL query changes can be explained by Case 2 of the query rewrite rule. The original query had an outer `SELECT` clause that matched the columns and aggregates of an inner query, specifically the `SUM(cs_ext_discount_amt)` operation. The rewrite rule identified this pattern and removed the inner `SELECT` layer, directly applying the `SUM` function to the `cs_ext_discount_amt` column from the `catalog_sales` table. This optimization eliminates unnecessary projection and simplifies the query execution plan, improving performance without altering the query's logical outcome.
Query 2: The SQL query changes can be explained as follows:
- The scalar sub-query that calculated `1.3 * AVG(cs_ext_discount_amt)` for a specific date range and item conditions was originally used to filter rows in the WHERE clause.
- This sub-query was transformed into a LEFT JOIN operation, where the sub-query is now a derived table that calculates the aggregate value for each `cs_item_sk`.
- The JOIN condition ensures that each row in the `catalog_sales` table is matched with the corresponding aggregate value from the sub-query based on `cs_item_sk`.
- The condition `cs_ext_discount_amt > sub_query.agg_result` is applied after the JOIN to filter the results, ensuring that only rows with `cs_ext_discount_amt` greater than the calculated average are included.
- This transformation optimizes the query by allowing the use of JOIN operations, which can be more efficient than executing a scalar sub-query for each row in the outer query.

"""The SQL query changes can be explained by Case 2 of the query rewrite rule. The original query had an outer `SELECT` clause that matched the columns and aggregates of an inner query, specifically the `SUM(cs_ext_discount_amt)` operation.

Query Rewrite 2:
"""The SQL query changes can be explained as follows:
- The scalar sub-query that calculated `1.3 * AVG(cs_ext_discount_amt)` for a specific date range and item conditions was originally used to filter rows in the WHERE clause.
- This sub-query was transformed into a LEFT JOIN operation, where the sub-query is now a derived table that calculates the aggregate value for each `cs_item_sk`.
- The JOIN condition ensures that each row in the `catalog_sales` table is matched with the corresponding aggregate value from the sub-query based on `cs_item_sk`.
- The condition `cs_ext_discount_amt > sub_query.agg_result` is applied after the JOIN to filter the results, ensuring that only rows with `cs_ext_discount_amt` greater than the calculated average are included.
- This transformation optimizes the query by allowing the use of JOIN operations, which can be more efficient than executing a scalar sub-query for each row in the outer query."""

The first strategy involves removing an unnecessary outer `SELECT` clause that redundantly matched the columns and aggregates of an inner query, specifically the `SUM(cs_ext_discount_amt)` operation. By directly applying the `SUM` function to the `cs_ext_discount_amt` column from the `catalog_sales` table, this rewrite eliminates unnecessary projection and simplifies the query execution plan. The second strategy transforms a scalar sub-query, which calculated `1.3 * AVG(cs_ext_discount_amt)` for filtering purposes, into a more efficient LEFT JOIN operation. This transformation involves creating a derived table that calculates the aggregate value for each `cs_item_sk`, and then joining it with the `catalog_sales` table based on `cs_item_sk`. The condition `cs_ext_discount_amt > sub_query.agg_result` is applied post-join to filter results, leveraging JOIN operations that can be more efficient than executing a scalar sub-query for each row. Together, these strategies aim to streamline the query execution and enhance performance without altering the logical outcome."""\n\nQuery Rewrite Rules:\n### Rule AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: - The SQL query contains a `GROUP BY` clause that groups by simple columns (no expressions in the `GROUP BY` list).\n- The aggregate functions in the `SELECT` clause operate directly on columns (no expressions inside the aggregate functions).\n- The `SELECT` clause only contains the columns used in the `GROUP BY` clause and the aggregates without any transformations or additional expressions.\n**Transformations**: - Directly apply the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions to the data source referred to in the `FROM` clause of the inner query before the projection.\n- Eliminate the outer projection layer if it only renames the columns without transforming them.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: - The `SELECT` clause of an outer query precisely matches the columns used in the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions of an inner query, without any column transformations or renamings.\n- The inner `SELECT` only serves as a passthrough for these columns.\n**Transformations**: - Remove the inner `SELECT` layer, directly applying the aggregate functions and `GROUP BY` to the original data source."""\n\n### Rule FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: The query contains a scalar sub-query within the WHERE clause.\n**Transformations**: The scalar sub-query should be transformed into a LEFT JOIN operation with an aggregate function on the column(s) being selected in the sub-query.

The first strategy involves removing an unnecessary outer `SELECT` clause that redundantly matched the columns and aggregates of an inner query, specifically the `SUM(cs_ext_discount_amt)` operation. By directly applying the `SUM` function to the `cs_ext_discount_amt` column from the `catalog_sales` table, this rewrite eliminates unnecessary projection and simplifies the query execution plan. The second strategy transforms a scalar sub-query, which calculated `1.3 * AVG(cs_ext_discount_amt)` for filtering purposes, into a more efficient LEFT JOIN operation. This transformation involves creating a derived table that calculates the aggregate value for each `cs_item_sk`, and then joining it with the `catalog_sales` table based on `cs_item_sk`. The condition `cs_ext_discount_amt > sub_query.agg_result` is applied post-join to filter results, leveraging JOIN operations that can be more efficient than executing a scalar sub-query for each row. Together, these strategies aim to streamline the query execution and enhance performance without altering the logical outcome."""\n\nQuery Rewrite Rules:\n### Rule AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: - The SQL query contains a `GROUP BY` clause that groups by simple columns (no expressions in the `GROUP BY` list).\n- The aggregate functions in the `SELECT` clause operate directly on columns (no expressions inside the aggregate functions).\n- The `SELECT` clause only contains the columns used in the `GROUP BY` clause and the aggregates without any transformations or additional expressions.\n**Transformations**: - Directly apply the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions to the data source referred to in the `FROM` clause of the inner query before the projection.\n- Eliminate the outer projection layer if it only renames the columns without transforming them.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: - The `SELECT` clause of an outer query precisely matches the columns used in the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions of an inner query, without any column transformations or renamings.\n- The inner `SELECT` only serves as a passthrough for these columns.\n**Transformations**: - Remove the inner `SELECT` layer, directly applying the aggregate functions and `GROUP BY` to the original data source."""\n\n### Rule FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: The query contains a scalar sub-query within the WHERE clause.\n**Transformations**: The scalar sub-query should be transformed into a LEFT JOIN operation with an aggregate function on the column(s) being selected in the sub-query. The JOIN condition uses the correlation ID (the matching column(s) in both outer and sub-query).\n  - Original Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 WHERE column = (SELECT AGG_FUNCTION(column2) FROM table2 WHERE table1.join_column = table2.join_column)\n  - Transformed Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 LEFT JOIN (SELECT join_column, AGG_FUNCTION(column2) AS agg_result FROM table2 GROUP BY join_column) AS sub_query ON table1.join_column = sub_query.join_column WHERE column = sub_query.agg_result\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: The query contains `IN`, `EXISTS`, or `UNIQUE` sub-queries within the WHERE clause that are correlated with the outer query.\n**Transformations**: - For `IN` Sub-queries: Replace the `IN` clause with a JOIN operation and a WHERE condition that checks for non-null values on the side of the sub-query.\n    - Original Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 WHERE column IN (SELECT column2 FROM table2 WHERE table1.join_column = table2.join_column)\n    - Transformed Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.join_column = table2.join_column WHERE table2.column2 IS NOT NULL\n  - For `EXISTS` Sub-queries: Convert the `EXISTS` condition into a JOIN operation, using WHERE to filter rows that match the JOIN condition.\n    - Original Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM table2 WHERE table1.join_column = table2.join_class)\n    - Transformed Query Structure: SELECT DISTINCT table1.* FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.join_column = table2.join_column\n  - For `UNIQUE` Sub-queries: Since `UNIQUE` requires a bit more complex handling not directly mappable to a standard JOIN, it should be considered a special case where the goal is to ensure that rows from the outer query match a unique set in the sub-query. This might not translate directly into SQL syntax without additional sub-query or DISTINCT aggregation."""\n\nArranged Rule Sequence: ["AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE", "FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE"]\n\nUtilized Rules: ["AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE", "FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE"]\n\nUnutilized Rules: []'}], 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'stream': False, 'temperature': 0.1}}
