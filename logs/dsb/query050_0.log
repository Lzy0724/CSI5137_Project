When the `LIMIT` clause is used to fetch a specified number of rows.\n2. When `ORDER BY` is used in conjunction with `LIMIT` to sort and limit the number of rows retrieved, particularly when sorting can leverage an index.\n3. When `DISTINCT` is used along with `LIMIT` to quickly identify and return unique rows without scanning the full dataset.\n4. During the use of `GROUP BY`, where optimization might involve sorting or traversing indexes in order to efficiently compute group values without processing the entire dataset.\n5. When sorting a specific number of rows from a single table based on non-indexed columns, utilizing in-memory sorting (`filesort`) techniques.\n**Transformations**: The specific SQL transformations that emerge from applying these optimization rules are:\n1. Combining `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY` encourages the database engine to stop the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained, avoiding full table sorts.\n2. Using `LIMIT` with `DISTINCT` leads to an early termination of the search for unique rows as soon as the needed amount is gathered, reducing time and resources spent on scanning the entire dataset.\n3. In the context of `GROUP BY`, optimizations may include indexing strategies or modifications to the way sorting is handled, such as employing `filesort` mechanisms that do not require temporary tables, ensuring that the database engine processes only the necessary data for group computations.\n4. Efficiencies are gained by encouraging the use of indexed columns with `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT`, making queries more efficient by reducing the cost associated with sorting and filtering operations.\n"""\nRule 3:\n"""\n**Conditions**: The SQL query rewrite rule applies when there are:\n- Functions or operations (especially deterministic ones) within the SELECT, WHERE, JOIN conditions, or any part of the query that is executed multiple times for the same row.\n- The presence of potentially computationally expensive operations or function calls that are not dependent on the data of the specific row and thus can be optimized.\n**Transformations**: 1. Move repeated function calls or operations outside of loops, if applicable. For example, if a function that generates a calculated value based on constants or parameters (not row-specific data) is being called in a loop, calculate the value once before the loop and store the result for reuse.\n   \n2. Replace inline functions in the SELECT or WHERE clause with a pre-calculated column if the function is deterministic and the input data does not change frequently. This might involve:\n   - Creating a temporary table that includes the results of the expensive function calls.\n   - Using a subquery or a Common Table Expression (CTE) that calculates the value once and then joins it with the main query.\n   \n3. When using aggregate functions that are called multiple times with the same parameters, consider storing the result in a variable or a temporary table, especially if the data set is large.\n\n4. Avoid using functions on indexed columns in the WHERE clause. This prevents the database from using the index efficiently. If a function must be used, consider creating a computed column that pre-calculates the function\'s result and index that column instead.\n\n5. If possible, simplify expressions and calculations to reduce their complexity and execution time. This might involve algebraic simplification or breaking down complex calculations into simpler parts that can be calculated separately and then combined.\n\nExample:\nOriginal Query:\n```sql\nSELECT id, name, expensive_function(column) as expensive_result\nFROM table\nWHERE expensive_function(column) > 100;\n```\n\nTransformed Query using a CTE:\n```sql\nWITH PreCalculated AS (\n  SELECT id, name, column, expensive_function(column) as expensive_result\n  FROM table\n)\nSELECT id, name, expensive_sel as expensive_result\nFROM PreCalculated\nWHERE expensive_result > 100;\n```\n"""\nRule 4:\n"""\n**Conditions**: The rule applies when the original SQL query performs multiple scans or joins on the same table to retrieve different attributes for certain conditions, or when the query structure results in redundant data processing and complexity that could be reduced.\n**Transformations**: - Combine multiple joins into a single join operation by using `CASE` statements to conditionally select different attributes from the table in one pass. \n- Use the `COALESCE` function in conjunction with `CASE` statements to efficiently merge conditional attributes into distinct columns based on specific criteria without the need for additional joins.\n- Optimize the selection of conditional attributes by integrating `GROUP BY` with aggregate functions like `MAX` within `CASE` statements, thus condensing the result set to only the necessary data and avoiding needless retrieval and processing steps.\n- The overall transformation leads to a single, more efficient query that accomplishes the tasks of multiple, less efficient operations, improving performance, and simplifying the query for better readability and maintenance.\n"""'}], 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'stream': False, 'temperature': 0.1}}

The filter\'s expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there\'s a matching row in the non-preserving side\'s table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned.\n```\n\nLogical Plan Changes After Rewrite: ```\n  LogicalSort(sort0=[$0(s_store_name)], sort1=[$1(s_company_id)], sort2=[$2(s_street_number)], sort3=[$3(s_street_name)], sort4=[$4(s_street_type)], sort5=[$5(s_suite_number)], sort6=[$6(s_city)], sort7=[$7(s_county)], sort8=[$8(s_state)], sort9=[$9(s_zip)], dir0=[ASC], dir1=[ASC], dir2=[ASC], dir3=[ASC], dir4=[ASC], dir5=[ASC], dir6=[ASC], dir7=[ASC], dir8=[ASC], dir9=[ASC], fetch=[100])\r\n    LogicalAggregate(group=[{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}], 30 days=[SUM($10)], 31-60 days=[SUM($11)], 61-90 days=[SUM($12)], 91-120 days=[SUM($13)], >120 days=[SUM($14)])\r\n      LogicalProject(s_store_name=[$48(s_store_name)], s_company_id=[$59(s_company_id)], s_street_number=[$61(s_street_number)], s_street_name=[$62(s_street_name)], s_street_type=[$63(s_street_type)], s_suite_number=[$64(s_suite_number)], s_city=[$65(s_city)], s_county=[$66(s_county)], s_state=[$67(s_state)], s_zip=[$68(s_zip)], $f10=[CASE(<=(-($23(sr_returned_date_sk), $0(ss_sold_date_sk)), 30), 1, 0)], $f11=[CASE(AND(>(-($23(sr_returned_date_sk), $0(ss_sold_date_sk)), 30), <=(-($23(sr_returned_date_sk), $0(ss_sold_date_sk)), 60)), 1, 0)], $f12=[CASE(AND(>(-($23(sr_returned_date_sk), $0(ss_sold_date_sk)), 60), <=(-($23(sr_returned_date_sk), $0(ss_sold_date_sk)), 90)), 1, 0)], $f13=[CASE(AND(>(-($23(sr_returned_date_sk), $0(ss_sold_date_sk)), 90), <=(-($23(sr_returned_date_sk), $0(ss_sold_date_sk)), 120)), 1, 0)], $f14=[CASE(>(-($23(sr_returned_date_sk), $0(ss_sold_date_sk)), 120), 1, 0)])\r\n-       LogicalFilter(condition=[AND(=($106(d_year), 1999), =($108(d_moy), 4), =($9(ss_ticket_number), $32(sr_ticket_number)), =($2(ss_item_sk), $25(sr_item_sk)), =($0(ss_sold_date_sk), $72(d_date_sk)), =($23(sr_returned_date_sk), $100(d_date_sk)), =($3(ss_customer_sk), $26(sr_customer_sk)), =($7(ss_store_sk), $43(s_store_sk)), >=($74(d_date), -($102(d_date), 10368000000:INTERVAL DAY)), <=($74(d_date), $102(d_date)))])\r\n-         LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n+       LogicalJoin(condition=[AND(=($23(sr_returned_date_sk), $100(d_date_sk)), >=($74(d_date), -($102(d_date), 10368000000:INTERVAL DAY)), <=($74(d_date), $102(d_date)))], joinType=[inner])\r\n+         LogicalJoin(condition=[=($0(ss_sold_date_sk), $72(d_date_sk))], joinType=[inner])\r\n-           LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n?                                    -\n\n+           LogicalJoin(condition=[=($7(ss_store_sk), $43(s_store_sk))], joinType=[inner])\r\n?                                  +++++++++ +  ++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n+             LogicalJoin(condition=[AND(=($9(ss_ticket_number), $32(sr_ticket_number)), =($2(ss_item_sk), $25(sr_item_sk)), =($3(ss_customer_sk), $26(sr_customer_sk)))], joinType=[inner])\r\n-             LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n-               LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n-                 LogicalTableScan(table=[[store_sales]])\r\n? --\n\n+               LogicalTableScan(table=[[store_sales]])\r\n-                 LogicalTableScan(table=[[store_returns]])\r\n? --\n\n+               LogicalTableScan(table=[[store_returns]])\r\n-               LogicalTableScan(table=[[store]])\r\n? --\n\n+             LogicalTableScan(table=[[store]])\r\n-             LogicalTableScan(table=[[date_dim]])\r\n? --\n\n+           LogicalTableScan(table=[[date_dim]])\r\n+         LogicalFilter(condition=[AND(=($6(d_year), 1999), =($8(d_moy), 4))])\r\n            LogicalTableScan(table=[[date_dim]])\r\n  \n```'}], 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'stream': False, 'temperature': 0.1}}

The filter\'s expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there\'s a matching row in the non-preserving side\'s table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned.\n```\n\nLogical Plan Changes After Rewrite: ```\n  LogicalSort(sort0=[$0(s_store_name)], sort1=[$1(s_company_id)], sort2=[$2(s_street_number)], sort3=[$3(s_street_name)], sort4=[$4(s_street_type)], sort5=[$5(s_suite_number)], sort6=[$6(s_city)], sort7=[$7(s_county)], sort8=[$8(s_state)], sort9=[$9(s_zip)], dir0=[ASC], dir1=[ASC], dir2=[ASC], dir3=[ASC], dir4=[ASC], dir5=[ASC], dir6=[ASC], dir7=[ASC], dir8=[ASC], dir9=[ASC], fetch=[100])\r\n    LogicalAggregate(group=[{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}], 30 days=[SUM($10)], 31-60 days=[SUM($11)], 61-90 days=[SUM($12)], 91-120 days=[SUM($13)], >120 days=[SUM($14)])\r\n      LogicalProject(s_store_name=[$48(s_store_name)], s_company_id=[$59(s_company_id)], s_street_number=[$61(s_street_number)], s_street_name=[$62(s_street_name)], s_street_type=[$63(s_street_type)], s_suite_number=[$64(s_suite_number)], s_city=[$65(s_city)], s_county=[$66(s_county)], s_state=[$67(s_state)], s_zip=[$68(s_zip)], $f10=[CASE(<=(-($23(sr_returned_date_sk), $0(ss_sold_date_sk)), 30), 1, 0)], $f11=[CASE(AND(>(-($23(sr_returned_date_sk), $0(ss_sold_date_sk)), 30), <=(-($23(sr_returned_date_sk), $0(ss_sold_date_sk)), 60)), 1, 0)], $f12=[CASE(AND(>(-($23(sr_returned_date_sk), $0(ss_sold_date_sk)), 60), <=(-($23(sr_returned_date_sk), $0(ss_sold_date_sk)), 90)), 1, 0)], $f13=[CASE(AND(>(-($23(sr_returned_date_sk), $0(ss_sold_date_sk)), 90), <=(-($23(sr_returned_date_sk), $0(ss_sold_date_sk)), 120)), 1, 0)], $f14=[CASE(>(-($23(sr_returned_date_sk), $0(ss_sold_date_sk)), 120), 1, 0)])\r\n-       LogicalFilter(condition=[AND(=($106(d_year), 1999), =($108(d_moy), 4), =($9(ss_ticket_number), $32(sr_ticket_number)), =($2(ss_item_sk), $25(sr_item_sk)), =($0(ss_sold_date_sk), $72(d_date_sk)), =($23(sr_returned_date_sk), $100(d_date_sk)), =($3(ss_customer_sk), $26(sr_customer_sk)), =($7(ss_store_sk), $43(s_store_sk)), >=($74(d_date), -($102(d_date), 10368000000:INTERVAL DAY)), <=($74(d_date), $102(d_date)))])\r\n-         LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n+       LogicalJoin(condition=[AND(=($23(sr_returned_date_sk), $100(d_date_sk)), >=($74(d_date), -($102(d_date), 10368000000:INTERVAL DAY)), <=($74(d_date), $102(d_date)))], joinType=[inner])\r\n+         LogicalJoin(condition=[=($0(ss_sold_date_sk), $72(d_date_sk))], joinType=[inner])\r\n-           LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n?                                    -\n\n+           LogicalJoin(condition=[=($7(ss_store_sk), $43(s_store_sk))], joinType=[inner])\r\n?                                  +++++++++ +  ++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n+             LogicalJoin(condition=[AND(=($9(ss_ticket_number), $32(sr_ticket_number)), =($2(ss_item_sk), $25(sr_item_sk)), =($3(ss_customer_sk), $26(sr_customer_sk)))], joinType=[inner])\r\n-             LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n-               LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n-                 LogicalTableScan(table=[[store_sales]])\r\n? --\n\n+               LogicalTableScan(table=[[store_sales]])\r\n-                 LogicalTableScan(table=[[store_returns]])\r\n? --\n\n+               LogicalTableScan(table=[[store_returns]])\r\n-               LogicalTableScan(table=[[store]])\r\n? --\n\n+             LogicalTableScan(table=[[store]])\r\n-             LogicalTableScan(table=[[date_dim]])\r\n? --\n\n+           LogicalTableScan(table=[[date_dim]])\r\n+         LogicalFilter(condition=[AND(=($6(d_year), 1999), =($8(d_moy), 4))])\r\n            LogicalTableScan(table=[[date_dim]])\r\n  \n```'}], 'response': "Step 1: The logical plan changes indicate that several filter conditions originally applied after the joins in the WHERE clause have been moved into the ON clause of the INNER JOINs. Specifically, conditions involving `sr_returned_date_sk`, `d_date`, and the date range filter have been moved into the ON clause of the join between `store_returns` and `date_dim`. Additionally, the join conditions between `store_sales`, `store_returns`, and `store` have been specified directly in the ON clause of their respective joins.\n\nStep 2: Parsing the logical plan changes, we see that:\n- The condition `sr_returned_date_sk = d2.d_date_sk` and the date range condition `d1.d_date between (d2.d_date - interval '120' day) and d2.d_date` have been moved from the WHERE clause to the ON clause of the join between `store_returns` and `date_dim`.\n- The join conditions `ss_ticket_number = sr_ticket_number`, `ss_item_sk = sr_item_sk`, and `ss_customer_sk = sr_customer_sk` have been moved from the WHERE clause to the ON clause of the join between `store_sales` and `store_returns`.\n- The condition `ss_store_sk = s_store_sk` has been moved from the WHERE clause to the ON clause of the join between `store_sales` and `store`.\n\nStep 3: The query rewrite rule contains multiple cases. The changes observed in the logical plan match Case 1 of the query rewrite rule. This case applies when a filter condition is placed on the result set of an INNER JOIN operation, and the filter's expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join. The transformations involve moving such conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN.\n\nStep 4: In the original SQL query, the WHERE clause contained conditions that could be logically associated with only one side of the join. For example, the condition `sr_returned_date_sk = d2.d_date_sk` and the date range condition `d1.d_date between (d2.d_date - interval '120' day) and d2.d_date` only involve columns from `store_returns` and `date_dim`. According to Case 1 of the query rewrite rule, these conditions were moved into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN between `store_returns` and `date_dim`. Similarly, the join conditions between `store_sales`, `store_returns`, and `store` were moved into their respective ON clauses. This transformation optimizes the query by reducing the size of the datasets before the join occurs, potentially improving performance by filtering rows earlier in the query execution process.", 'time': 4.31808614730835}

When `DISTINCT` is used along with `LIMIT` to quickly identify and return unique rows without scanning the full dataset.\n4. During the use of `GROUP BY`, where optimization might involve sorting or traversing indexes in order to efficiently compute group values without processing the entire dataset.\n5. When sorting a specific number of rows from a single table based on non-indexed columns, utilizing in-memory sorting (`filesort`) techniques.\n**Transformations**: The specific SQL transformations that emerge from applying these optimization rules are:\n1. Combining `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY` encourages the database engine to stop the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained, avoiding full table sorts.\n2. Using `LIMIT` with `DISTINCT` leads to an early termination of the search for unique rows as soon as the needed amount is gathered, reducing time and resources spent on scanning the entire dataset.\n3. In the context of `GROUP BY`, optimizations may include indexing strategies or modifications to the way sorting is handled, such as employing `filesort` mechanisms that do not require temporary tables, ensuring that the database engine processes only the necessary data for group computations.\n4. Efficiencies are gained by encouraging the use of indexed columns with `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT`, making queries more efficient by reducing the cost associated with sorting and filtering operations.\n"""\nRule 3:\n"""\n**Conditions**: The SQL query rewrite rule applies when there are:\n- Functions or operations (especially deterministic ones) within the SELECT, WHERE, JOIN conditions, or any part of the query that is executed multiple times for the same row.\n- The presence of potentially computationally expensive operations or function calls that are not dependent on the data of the specific row and thus can be optimized.\n**Transformations**: 1. Move repeated function calls or operations outside of loops, if applicable. For example, if a function that generates a calculated value based on constants or parameters (not row-specific data) is being called in a loop, calculate the value once before the loop and store the result for reuse.\n   \n2. Replace inline functions in the SELECT or WHERE clause with a pre-calculated column if the function is deterministic and the input data does not change frequently. This might involve:\n   - Creating a temporary table that includes the results of the expensive function calls.\n   - Using a subquery or a Common Table Expression (CTE) that calculates the value once and then joins it with the main query.\n   \n3. When using aggregate functions that are called multiple times with the same parameters, consider storing the result in a variable or a temporary table, especially if the data set is large.\n\n4. Avoid using functions on indexed columns in the WHERE clause. This prevents the database from using the index efficiently. If a function must be used, consider creating a computed column that pre-calculates the function\'s result and index that column instead.\n\n5. If possible, simplify expressions and calculations to reduce their complexity and execution time. This might involve algebraic simplification or breaking down complex calculations into simpler parts that can be calculated separately and then combined.\n\nExample:\nOriginal Query:\n```sql\nSELECT id, name, expensive_function(column) as expensive_result\nFROM table\nWHERE expensive_function(column) > 100;\n```\n\nTransformed Query using a CTE:\n```sql\nWITH PreCalculated AS (\n  SELECT id, name, column, expensive_function(column) as expensive_result\n  FROM table\n)\nSELECT id, name, expensive_sel as expensive_result\nFROM PreCalculated\nWHERE expensive_result > 100;\n```\n"""\nRule 4:\n"""\n**Conditions**: The rule applies when the original SQL query performs multiple scans or joins on the same table to retrieve different attributes for certain conditions, or when the query structure results in redundant data processing and complexity that could be reduced.\n**Transformations**: - Combine multiple joins into a single join operation by using `CASE` statements to conditionally select different attributes from the table in one pass. \n- Use the `COALESCE` function in conjunction with `CASE` statements to efficiently merge conditional attributes into distinct columns based on specific criteria without the need for additional joins.\n- Optimize the selection of conditional attributes by integrating `GROUP BY` with aggregate functions like `MAX` within `CASE` statements, thus condensing the result set to only the necessary data and avoiding needless retrieval and processing steps.\n- The overall transformation leads to a single, more efficient query that accomplishes the tasks of multiple, less efficient operations, improving performance, and simplifying the query for better readability and maintenance.\n"""'}], 'response': 'Step 1: Analyze the given SQL query against each provided rewrite rule\'s conditions.\n\n- **Rule 1 Conditions**: The query performs a `GROUP BY` operation and involves multiple `JOIN` operations.

Query 1: In the original SQL query, the WHERE clause contained conditions that could be logically associated with only one side of the join. For example, the condition `sr_returned_date_sk = d2.d_date_sk` and the date range condition `d1.d_date between (d2.d_date - interval '120' day) and d2.d_date` only involve columns from `store_returns` and `date_dim`. According to Case 1 of the query rewrite rule, these conditions were moved into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN between `store_returns` and `date_dim`. Similarly, the join conditions between `store_sales`, `store_returns`, and `store` were moved into their respective ON clauses.

"""In the original SQL query, the WHERE clause contained conditions that could be logically associated with only one side of the join. For example, the condition `sr_returned_date_sk = d2.d_date_sk` and the date range condition `d1.d_date between (d2.d_date - interval '120' day) and d2.d_date` only involve columns from `store_returns` and `date_dim`. According to Case 1 of the query rewrite rule, these conditions were moved into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN between `store_returns` and `date_dim`. Similarly, the join conditions between `store_sales`, `store_returns`, and `store` were moved into their respective ON clauses. This transformation optimizes the query by reducing the size of the datasets before the join occurs, potentially improving performance by filtering rows earlier in the query execution process."""

Query Rewrite 2:
"""The query can be optimized by applying Rule 1, which suggests performing `GROUP BY` operations earlier in the query execution process.

The transformation involves creating a subquery that performs the `GROUP BY` and aggregation on the `store_sales` and `store_returns` tables before joining with the `store` and `date_dim` tables. This reduces the size of the intermediate datasets and minimizes the workload on subsequent operations.

05:35:20,734 root WARNING Failed to cluster rewrite strategies: To cluster the provided query rewrite strategies, we need to identify the underlying principles or techniques each strategy employs. Here's a breakdown of the strategies:

1. **Query Rewrite 1**: Focuses on moving conditions from the WHERE clause to the ON clause of joins to optimize the join operation by filtering rows earlier.

2. **Query Rewrite 2**: Uses subqueries to perform pre-aggregation, reducing the size of intermediate datasets before joining with other tables.

3. **Query Rewrite 3**: Relies on optimizing the use of `LIMIT` and `ORDER BY` clauses, suggesting the use of indexes to improve performance without changing the SQL syntax.

4. **Query Rewrite 4**: Uses a CTE to pre-calculate a repeated expression, reducing redundant calculations.

Based on these observations, we can cluster the strategies as follows:

- **Cluster 1**: Strategies that focus on optimizing join operations and reducing dataset size before joins.
  - Query Rewrite 1
  - Query Rewrite 2

- **Cluster 2**: Strategies that focus on optimizing calculations and expressions.
  - Query Rewrite 4

- **Cluster 3**: Strategies that focus on optimizing sorting and limiting operations.
  - Query Rewrite 3

Here is the clustering in Python list format:

```python
[
    [0, 1],  # Cluster 1: Optimizing joins and dataset size
    [3],     # Cluster 2: Optimizing calculations
    [2]      # Cluster 3: Optimizing sorting and limiting

The filter's expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there's a matching row in the non-preserving side's table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned."}], [], [{'name': 'PROJECT_FILTER_TRANSPOSE', 'rewrite': "**Conditions**: This rewrite rule can be applied when an SQL query contains a SELECT operation (acting as the `Project` operation) followed by a WHERE clause (acting as the `Filter` operation), provided that the SELECT does not contain window functions (such as RANK(), ROW_NUMBER(), etc.) and the columns selected do not affect the outcome of the WHERE clause.\n**Transformations**: To apply the rule, refactor the SQL query so that the conditions in the WHERE clause are evaluated before the columns are selected in the SELECT clause.

This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there\'s a matching row in the non-preserving side\'s table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned."""\n\n### Rule PROJECT_FILTER_TRANSPOSE:\n"""**Conditions**: This rewrite rule can be applied when an SQL query contains a SELECT operation (acting as the `Project` operation) followed by a WHERE clause (acting as the `Filter` operation), provided that the SELECT does not contain window functions (such as RANK(), ROW_NUMBER(), etc.) and the columns selected do not affect the outcome of the WHERE clause.\n**Transformations**: To apply the rule, refactor the SQL query so that the conditions in the WHERE clause are evaluated before the columns are selected in the SELECT clause. This may involve moving computations or column transformations from the SELECT clause to a sub-query that the WHERE clause is applied on, ensuring the final SELECT clause on the outermost query matches the original query\'s expected outcome. - Before: SELECT col1, transformation_function(col2) FROM table WHERE condition; - After: SELECT col1, transformation_function(col2) FROM (SELECT col1, col2 FROM table WHERE condition) AS subquery;"""\n\n### Rule AGGREGATE_REDUCE_FUNCTIONS:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: any SELECT statement or subquery using the AVG aggregate function\n**Transformations**: AVG(x) as SUM(x) / COUNT(x)\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: computing the population standard deviation\n**Transformations**: STDDEV_POP(x) as the square root of (`SUM(x^2) - SUM(x)^2 / COUNT(x)`) / COUNT(x)\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: for the sample standard deviation computation\n**Transformations**: STDDEV_SAMP(x) as the square root of (`SUM(x^2) - SUM(x)^2 / COUNT(x)`) / (COUNT(x) - 1)\nCase 4:\n**Conditions**: for the population variance computation\n**Transformations**: VAR_POP(x) as (`SUM(x^2) - SUM(x)^2 / COUNT(x)`) / COUNT(x)\nCase 5:\n**Conditions**: for the sample variance computation\n**Transformations**: VAR_SAMP(x) as (`SUM(x^2) - SUM(x)^2 / COUNT(x)`) / (COUNT(x) - 1)\nCase 6:\n**Conditions**: to compute population covariance\n**Transformations**: COVAR_POP(x, y) by applying a formula involving SUM and COUNT\nCase 7:\n**Conditions**: using a formula for sample covariance\n**Transformations**: COVAR_SAMP(x, y) using a formula involving SUM, COUNT, and an adjustment for sample calculations\nCase 8:\n**Conditions**: for transforming REGR_SXX(x, y) and REGR_SYY(x, y)\n**Transformations**: into expressions involving the computation of VAR_POP(x) or VAR_POP(y) respectively, multiplied by REGR_COUNT(x, y)"""\n\n### Rule JOIN_TO_CORRELATE:\n"""**Conditions**: The join type is either INNER JOIN or LEFT JOIN.

Identify the INNER JOIN or LEFT JOIN condition in the SQL query. 2. Extract the ON clause representing the join condition. 3. For INNER JOIN: - Replace the INNER JOIN with a WHERE EXISTS clause, moving the original join condition into the WHERE clause of a subquery that selects from the right side table.

Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there\'s a matching row in the non-preserving side\'s table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned."""'}], 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'stream': False, 'temperature': 0.1}}

First, by moving conditions specific to certain tables from the WHERE clause to the ON clause of their respective JOINs, the query can filter rows earlier, reducing dataset sizes before joining, as suggested in Query Rewrite 1. Query Rewrite 2 recommends pre-aggregating data using subqueries to perform GROUP BY operations earlier, thus minimizing the size of intermediate datasets and reducing the workload on subsequent operations. Query Rewrite 3 emphasizes the importance of leveraging the LIMIT and ORDER BY clauses efficiently, ensuring that indexes are in place to enhance performance by minimizing the number of rows processed and avoiding full table sorts. Lastly, Query Rewrite 4 suggests optimizing repeated calculations by using a Common Table Expression (CTE) or subquery to calculate `(sr_returned_date_sk - ss_sold_date_sk)` once and reuse the result, thereby improving computational efficiency. These strategies collectively aim to enhance query performance by reducing data processing overhead and optimizing execution plans."""\n\nQuery Rewrite Rules:\n### Rule FILTER_INTO_JOIN:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: This SQL query rewrite rule applies when a filter condition is placed on the result set of an INNER JOIN operation. The filter\'s expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there\'s a matching row in the non-preserving side\'s table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned."""\n\nRule Subset Sequences:\n### Rule Sequence 1: ["FILTER_INTO_JOIN"]\n\n### Rule Sequence 2: ["FILTER_INTO_JOIN"]'}], 'response': 'To optimize the given SQL query, we need to apply the provided query rewrite rules in an effective sequence. The suggestions and rules indicate that the primary focus should be on moving filter conditions into the JOIN clauses where applicable, as this can significantly reduce the size of datasets before they are joined, thus improving performance.\n\nThe provided rule subset sequences both consist of the single rule "FILTER_INTO_JOIN". This suggests that the primary optimization strategy involves applying this rule to the query. The rule "FILTER_INTO_JOIN" is designed to move filter conditions from the WHERE clause into the ON clause of JOINs, which can help in reducing the number of rows processed during the join operations.\n\nGiven that both rule subset sequences are identical and consist of only one rule, the overall sequence for all the rules is straightforward.

First, by moving conditions specific to certain tables from the WHERE clause to the ON clause of their respective JOINs, the query can filter rows earlier, reducing dataset sizes before joining, as suggested in Query Rewrite 1. Query Rewrite 2 recommends pre-aggregating data using subqueries to perform GROUP BY operations earlier, thus minimizing the size of intermediate datasets and reducing the workload on subsequent operations. Query Rewrite 3 emphasizes the importance of leveraging the LIMIT and ORDER BY clauses efficiently, ensuring that indexes are in place to enhance performance by minimizing the number of rows processed and avoiding full table sorts. Lastly, Query Rewrite 4 suggests optimizing repeated calculations by using a Common Table Expression (CTE) or subquery to calculate `(sr_returned_date_sk - ss_sold_date_sk)` once and reuse the result, thereby improving computational efficiency. These strategies collectively aim to enhance query performance by reducing data processing overhead and optimizing execution plans."""\n\nQuery Rewrite Rules:\n### Rule FILTER_INTO_JOIN:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: This SQL query rewrite rule applies when a filter condition is placed on the result set of an INNER JOIN operation. The filter\'s expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there\'s a matching row in the non-preserving side\'s table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned."""\n\nArranged Rule Sequence: ["FILTER_INTO_JOIN"]\n\nUtilized Rules: ["FILTER_INTO_JOIN"]\n\nUnutilized Rules: []'}], 'response': 'Step 1: The provided arrangement only includes the "FILTER_INTO_JOIN" rule, which was utilized.

However, these strategies are not covered by the "FILTER_INTO_JOIN" rule alone. To better match the provided query rewrite suggestions, additional rules should be considered if they were available.
