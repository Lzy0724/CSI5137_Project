When the `LIMIT` clause is used to fetch a specified number of rows.\n2. When `ORDER BY` is used in conjunction with `LIMIT` to sort and limit the number of rows retrieved, particularly when sorting can leverage an index.\n3. When `DISTINCT` is used along with `LIMIT` to quickly identify and return unique rows without scanning the full dataset.\n4. During the use of `GROUP BY`, where optimization might involve sorting or traversing indexes in order to efficiently compute group values without processing the entire dataset.\n5. When sorting a specific number of rows from a single table based on non-indexed columns, utilizing in-memory sorting (`filesort`) techniques.\n**Transformations**: The specific SQL transformations that emerge from applying these optimization rules are:\n1. Combining `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY` encourages the database engine to stop the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained, avoiding full table sorts.\n2. Using `LIMIT` with `DISTINCT` leads to an early termination of the search for unique rows as soon as the needed amount is gathered, reducing time and resources spent on scanning the entire dataset.\n3. In the context of `GROUP BY`, optimizations may include indexing strategies or modifications to the way sorting is handled, such as employing `filesort` mechanisms that do not require temporary tables, ensuring that the database engine processes only the necessary data for group computations.\n4. Efficiencies are gained by encouraging the use of indexed columns with `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT`, making queries more efficient by reducing the cost associated with sorting and filtering operations.\n"""\nRule 3:\n"""\n**Conditions**: The SQL query rewrite rule applies when there are:\n- Functions or operations (especially deterministic ones) within the SELECT, WHERE, JOIN conditions, or any part of the query that is executed multiple times for the same row.\n- The presence of potentially computationally expensive operations or function calls that are not dependent on the data of the specific row and thus can be optimized.\n**Transformations**: 1. Move repeated function calls or operations outside of loops, if applicable. For example, if a function that generates a calculated value based on constants or parameters (not row-specific data) is being called in a loop, calculate the value once before the loop and store the result for reuse.\n   \n2. Replace inline functions in the SELECT or WHERE clause with a pre-calculated column if the function is deterministic and the input data does not change frequently. This might involve:\n   - Creating a temporary table that includes the results of the expensive function calls.\n   - Using a subquery or a Common Table Expression (CTE) that calculates the value once and then joins it with the main query.\n   \n3. When using aggregate functions that are called multiple times with the same parameters, consider storing the result in a variable or a temporary table, especially if the data set is large.\n\n4. Avoid using functions on indexed columns in the WHERE clause. This prevents the database from using the index efficiently. If a function must be used, consider creating a computed column that pre-calculates the function\'s result and index that column instead.\n\n5. If possible, simplify expressions and calculations to reduce their complexity and execution time. This might involve algebraic simplification or breaking down complex calculations into simpler parts that can be calculated separately and then combined.\n\nExample:\nOriginal Query:\n```sql\nSELECT id, name, expensive_function(column) as expensive_result\nFROM table\nWHERE expensive_function(column) > 100;\n```\n\nTransformed Query using a CTE:\n```sql\nWITH PreCalculated AS (\n  SELECT id, name, column, expensive_function(column) as expensive_result\n  FROM table\n)\nSELECT id, name, expensive_sel as expensive_result\nFROM PreCalculated\nWHERE expensive_result > 100;\n```\n"""\nRule 4:\n"""\n**Conditions**: The rule applies when the original SQL query performs multiple scans or joins on the same table to retrieve different attributes for certain conditions, or when the query structure results in redundant data processing and complexity that could be reduced.\n**Transformations**: - Combine multiple joins into a single join operation by using `CASE` statements to conditionally select different attributes from the table in one pass. \n- Use the `COALESCE` function in conjunction with `CASE` statements to efficiently merge conditional attributes into distinct columns based on specific criteria without the need for additional joins.\n- Optimize the selection of conditional attributes by integrating `GROUP BY` with aggregate functions like `MAX` within `CASE` statements, thus condensing the result set to only the necessary data and avoiding needless retrieval and processing steps.\n- The overall transformation leads to a single, more efficient query that accomplishes the tasks of multiple, less efficient operations, improving performance, and simplifying the query for better readability and maintenance.\n"""'}], 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'stream': False, 'temperature': 0.1}}

The filter\'s expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there\'s a matching row in the non-preserving side\'s table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned.\n```\n\nLogical Plan Changes After Rewrite: ```\n  LogicalSort(sort0=[$0(s_store_name)], sort1=[$1(s_company_id)], sort2=[$2(s_street_number)], sort3=[$3(s_street_name)], sort4=[$4(s_street_type)], sort5=[$5(s_suite_number)], sort6=[$6(s_city)], sort7=[$7(s_county)], sort8=[$8(s_state)], sort9=[$9(s_zip)], dir0=[ASC], dir1=[ASC], dir2=[ASC], dir3=[ASC], dir4=[ASC], dir5=[ASC], dir6=[ASC], dir7=[ASC], dir8=[ASC], dir9=[ASC], fetch=[100])\r\n    LogicalAggregate(group=[{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}], 30 days=[SUM($10)], 31-60 days=[SUM($11)], 61-90 days=[SUM($12)], 91-120 days=[SUM($13)], >120 days=[SUM($14)])\r\n      LogicalProject(s_store_name=[$48(s_store_name)], s_company_id=[$59(s_company_id)], s_street_number=[$61(s_street_number)], s_street_name=[$62(s_street_name)], s_street_type=[$63(s_street_type)], s_suite_number=[$64(s_suite_number)], s_city=[$65(s_city)], s_county=[$66(s_county)], s_state=[$67(s_state)], s_zip=[$68(s_zip)], $f10=[CASE(<=(-($23(sr_returned_date_sk), $0(ss_sold_date_sk)), 30), 1, 0)], $f11=[CASE(AND(>(-($23(sr_returned_date_sk), $0(ss_sold_date_sk)), 30), <=(-($23(sr_returned_date_sk), $0(ss_sold_date_sk)), 60)), 1, 0)], $f12=[CASE(AND(>(-($23(sr_returned_date_sk), $0(ss_sold_date_sk)), 60), <=(-($23(sr_returned_date_sk), $0(ss_sold_date_sk)), 90)), 1, 0)], $f13=[CASE(AND(>(-($23(sr_returned_date_sk), $0(ss_sold_date_sk)), 90), <=(-($23(sr_returned_date_sk), $0(ss_sold_date_sk)), 120)), 1, 0)], $f14=[CASE(>(-($23(sr_returned_date_sk), $0(ss_sold_date_sk)), 120), 1, 0)])\r\n-       LogicalFilter(condition=[AND(=($106(d_year), 2000), =($108(d_moy), 7), =($9(ss_ticket_number), $32(sr_ticket_number)), =($2(ss_item_sk), $25(sr_item_sk)), =($0(ss_sold_date_sk), $72(d_date_sk)), =($23(sr_returned_date_sk), $100(d_date_sk)), =($3(ss_customer_sk), $26(sr_customer_sk)), =($7(ss_store_sk), $43(s_store_sk)), >=($74(d_date), -($102(d_date), 10368000000:INTERVAL DAY)), <=($74(d_date), $102(d_date)))])\r\n-         LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n+       LogicalJoin(condition=[AND(=($23(sr_returned_date_sk), $100(d_date_sk)), >=($74(d_date), -($102(d_date), 10368000000:INTERVAL DAY)), <=($74(d_date), $102(d_date)))], joinType=[inner])\r\n+         LogicalJoin(condition=[=($0(ss_sold_date_sk), $72(d_date_sk))], joinType=[inner])\r\n-           LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n?                                    -\n\n+           LogicalJoin(condition=[=($7(ss_store_sk), $43(s_store_sk))], joinType=[inner])\r\n?                                  +++++++++ +  ++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n+             LogicalJoin(condition=[AND(=($9(ss_ticket_number), $32(sr_ticket_number)), =($2(ss_item_sk), $25(sr_item_sk)), =($3(ss_customer_sk), $26(sr_customer_sk)))], joinType=[inner])\r\n-             LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n-               LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n-                 LogicalTableScan(table=[[store_sales]])\r\n? --\n\n+               LogicalTableScan(table=[[store_sales]])\r\n-                 LogicalTableScan(table=[[store_returns]])\r\n? --\n\n+               LogicalTableScan(table=[[store_returns]])\r\n-               LogicalTableScan(table=[[store]])\r\n? --\n\n+             LogicalTableScan(table=[[store]])\r\n-             LogicalTableScan(table=[[date_dim]])\r\n? --\n\n+           LogicalTableScan(table=[[date_dim]])\r\n+         LogicalFilter(condition=[AND(=($6(d_year), 2000), =($8(d_moy), 7))])\r\n            LogicalTableScan(table=[[date_dim]])\r\n  \n```'}], 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'stream': False, 'temperature': 0.1}}

The filter\'s expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there\'s a matching row in the non-preserving side\'s table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned.\n```\n\nLogical Plan Changes After Rewrite: ```\n  LogicalSort(sort0=[$0(s_store_name)], sort1=[$1(s_company_id)], sort2=[$2(s_street_number)], sort3=[$3(s_street_name)], sort4=[$4(s_street_type)], sort5=[$5(s_suite_number)], sort6=[$6(s_city)], sort7=[$7(s_county)], sort8=[$8(s_state)], sort9=[$9(s_zip)], dir0=[ASC], dir1=[ASC], dir2=[ASC], dir3=[ASC], dir4=[ASC], dir5=[ASC], dir6=[ASC], dir7=[ASC], dir8=[ASC], dir9=[ASC], fetch=[100])\r\n    LogicalAggregate(group=[{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}], 30 days=[SUM($10)], 31-60 days=[SUM($11)], 61-90 days=[SUM($12)], 91-120 days=[SUM($13)], >120 days=[SUM($14)])\r\n      LogicalProject(s_store_name=[$48(s_store_name)], s_company_id=[$59(s_company_id)], s_street_number=[$61(s_street_number)], s_street_name=[$62(s_street_name)], s_street_type=[$63(s_street_type)], s_suite_number=[$64(s_suite_number)], s_city=[$65(s_city)], s_county=[$66(s_county)], s_state=[$67(s_state)], s_zip=[$68(s_zip)], $f10=[CASE(<=(-($23(sr_returned_date_sk), $0(ss_sold_date_sk)), 30), 1, 0)], $f11=[CASE(AND(>(-($23(sr_returned_date_sk), $0(ss_sold_date_sk)), 30), <=(-($23(sr_returned_date_sk), $0(ss_sold_date_sk)), 60)), 1, 0)], $f12=[CASE(AND(>(-($23(sr_returned_date_sk), $0(ss_sold_date_sk)), 60), <=(-($23(sr_returned_date_sk), $0(ss_sold_date_sk)), 90)), 1, 0)], $f13=[CASE(AND(>(-($23(sr_returned_date_sk), $0(ss_sold_date_sk)), 90), <=(-($23(sr_returned_date_sk), $0(ss_sold_date_sk)), 120)), 1, 0)], $f14=[CASE(>(-($23(sr_returned_date_sk), $0(ss_sold_date_sk)), 120), 1, 0)])\r\n-       LogicalFilter(condition=[AND(=($106(d_year), 2000), =($108(d_moy), 7), =($9(ss_ticket_number), $32(sr_ticket_number)), =($2(ss_item_sk), $25(sr_item_sk)), =($0(ss_sold_date_sk), $72(d_date_sk)), =($23(sr_returned_date_sk), $100(d_date_sk)), =($3(ss_customer_sk), $26(sr_customer_sk)), =($7(ss_store_sk), $43(s_store_sk)), >=($74(d_date), -($102(d_date), 10368000000:INTERVAL DAY)), <=($74(d_date), $102(d_date)))])\r\n-         LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n+       LogicalJoin(condition=[AND(=($23(sr_returned_date_sk), $100(d_date_sk)), >=($74(d_date), -($102(d_date), 10368000000:INTERVAL DAY)), <=($74(d_date), $102(d_date)))], joinType=[inner])\r\n+         LogicalJoin(condition=[=($0(ss_sold_date_sk), $72(d_date_sk))], joinType=[inner])\r\n-           LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n?                                    -\n\n+           LogicalJoin(condition=[=($7(ss_store_sk), $43(s_store_sk))], joinType=[inner])\r\n?                                  +++++++++ +  ++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n+             LogicalJoin(condition=[AND(=($9(ss_ticket_number), $32(sr_ticket_number)), =($2(ss_item_sk), $25(sr_item_sk)), =($3(ss_customer_sk), $26(sr_customer_sk)))], joinType=[inner])\r\n-             LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n-               LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n-                 LogicalTableScan(table=[[store_sales]])\r\n? --\n\n+               LogicalTableScan(table=[[store_sales]])\r\n-                 LogicalTableScan(table=[[store_returns]])\r\n? --\n\n+               LogicalTableScan(table=[[store_returns]])\r\n-               LogicalTableScan(table=[[store]])\r\n? --\n\n+             LogicalTableScan(table=[[store]])\r\n-             LogicalTableScan(table=[[date_dim]])\r\n? --\n\n+           LogicalTableScan(table=[[date_dim]])\r\n+         LogicalFilter(condition=[AND(=($6(d_year), 2000), =($8(d_moy), 7))])\r\n            LogicalTableScan(table=[[date_dim]])\r\n  \n```'}], 'response': "Step 1: The logical plan changes indicate that the query rewrite rule has transformed the original SQL query by altering the placement of certain filter conditions. Specifically, conditions that were originally part of a `LogicalFilter` have been moved into the `LogicalJoin` conditions. This suggests that the rewrite rule has optimized the query by pushing filter conditions closer to the data source, potentially reducing the size of intermediate datasets before the join operations.\n\nStep 2: Parsing the logical plan changes, we observe the following detailed changes in the SQL query:\n- The condition `sr_returned_date_sk = d2.d_date_sk` and the date range condition `d1.d_date between (d2.d_date - interval '120' day) and d2.d_date` have been moved from the `WHERE` clause to the `ON` clause of the `INNER JOIN` between `store_returns` and `date_dim d2`.\n- The join condition `ss_sold_date_sk = d1.d_date_sk` remains in the `ON` clause of the `INNER JOIN` between `store_sales` and `date_dim d1`.\n- The conditions `d2.d_year = 2000` and `d2.d_moy = 7` have been moved to a `LogicalFilter` applied directly to the `date_dim d2` table.\n\nStep 3: The SQL query rewrite rule contains multiple cases. In this scenario, the changes match Case 1 of the rewrite rule. This case applies when a filter condition can be logically associated with only one side of an `INNER JOIN` and can be moved into the `ON` clause of the join. The conditions `sr_returned_date_sk = d2.d_date_sk` and the date range condition are associated with `store_returns` and `date_dim d2`, allowing them to be moved into the `ON` clause of their respective join.\n\nStep 4: The query rewrite process can be explained as follows: The original SQL query had filter conditions in the `WHERE` clause that only involved columns from the `store_returns` and `date_dim d2` tables. According to Case 1 of the rewrite rule, these conditions can be moved into the `ON` clause of the `INNER JOIN` between these tables. This transformation optimizes the query by reducing the size of the datasets involved in the join operation, as the filtering is applied earlier in the query execution process. The conditions `sr_returned_date_sk = d2.d_date_sk` and the date range condition are now part of the join condition, which can lead to more efficient execution by potentially reducing the number of rows that need to be joined. Additionally, the conditions `d2.d_year = 2000` and `d2.d_moy = 7` are applied directly to the `date_dim d2` table, further optimizing the query by filtering the data at the earliest possible stage.", 'time': 5.8652942180633545}

During the use of `GROUP BY`, where optimization might involve sorting or traversing indexes in order to efficiently compute group values without processing the entire dataset.\n5. When sorting a specific number of rows from a single table based on non-indexed columns, utilizing in-memory sorting (`filesort`) techniques.\n**Transformations**: The specific SQL transformations that emerge from applying these optimization rules are:\n1. Combining `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY` encourages the database engine to stop the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained, avoiding full table sorts.\n2. Using `LIMIT` with `DISTINCT` leads to an early termination of the search for unique rows as soon as the needed amount is gathered, reducing time and resources spent on scanning the entire dataset.\n3. In the context of `GROUP BY`, optimizations may include indexing strategies or modifications to the way sorting is handled, such as employing `filesort` mechanisms that do not require temporary tables, ensuring that the database engine processes only the necessary data for group computations.\n4. Efficiencies are gained by encouraging the use of indexed columns with `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT`, making queries more efficient by reducing the cost associated with sorting and filtering operations.\n"""\nRule 3:\n"""\n**Conditions**: The SQL query rewrite rule applies when there are:\n- Functions or operations (especially deterministic ones) within the SELECT, WHERE, JOIN conditions, or any part of the query that is executed multiple times for the same row.\n- The presence of potentially computationally expensive operations or function calls that are not dependent on the data of the specific row and thus can be optimized.\n**Transformations**: 1. Move repeated function calls or operations outside of loops, if applicable. For example, if a function that generates a calculated value based on constants or parameters (not row-specific data) is being called in a loop, calculate the value once before the loop and store the result for reuse.\n   \n2. Replace inline functions in the SELECT or WHERE clause with a pre-calculated column if the function is deterministic and the input data does not change frequently. This might involve:\n   - Creating a temporary table that includes the results of the expensive function calls.\n   - Using a subquery or a Common Table Expression (CTE) that calculates the value once and then joins it with the main query.\n   \n3. When using aggregate functions that are called multiple times with the same parameters, consider storing the result in a variable or a temporary table, especially if the data set is large.\n\n4. Avoid using functions on indexed columns in the WHERE clause. This prevents the database from using the index efficiently. If a function must be used, consider creating a computed column that pre-calculates the function\'s result and index that column instead.\n\n5. If possible, simplify expressions and calculations to reduce their complexity and execution time. This might involve algebraic simplification or breaking down complex calculations into simpler parts that can be calculated separately and then combined.\n\nExample:\nOriginal Query:\n```sql\nSELECT id, name, expensive_function(column) as expensive_result\nFROM table\nWHERE expensive_function(column) > 100;\n```\n\nTransformed Query using a CTE:\n```sql\nWITH PreCalculated AS (\n  SELECT id, name, column, expensive_function(column) as expensive_result\n  FROM table\n)\nSELECT id, name, expensive_sel as expensive_result\nFROM PreCalculated\nWHERE expensive_result > 100;\n```\n"""\nRule 4:\n"""\n**Conditions**: The rule applies when the original SQL query performs multiple scans or joins on the same table to retrieve different attributes for certain conditions, or when the query structure results in redundant data processing and complexity that could be reduced.\n**Transformations**: - Combine multiple joins into a single join operation by using `CASE` statements to conditionally select different attributes from the table in one pass. \n- Use the `COALESCE` function in conjunction with `CASE` statements to efficiently merge conditional attributes into distinct columns based on specific criteria without the need for additional joins.\n- Optimize the selection of conditional attributes by integrating `GROUP BY` with aggregate functions like `MAX` within `CASE` statements, thus condensing the result set to only the necessary data and avoiding needless retrieval and processing steps.\n- The overall transformation leads to a single, more efficient query that accomplishes the tasks of multiple, less efficient operations, improving performance, and simplifying the query for better readability and maintenance.\n"""'}], 'response': 'Step 1: Analyze the given SQL query against each rewrite rule\'s conditions.\n\n- **Rule 1**: The query involves a `GROUP BY` operation and multiple `JOIN` operations.

Query 1: The query rewrite process can be explained as follows: The original SQL query had filter conditions in the `WHERE` clause that only involved columns from the `store_returns` and `date_dim d2` tables. According to Case 1 of the rewrite rule, these conditions can be moved into the `ON` clause of the `INNER JOIN` between these tables. This transformation optimizes the query by reducing the size of the datasets involved in the join operation, as the filtering is applied earlier in the query execution process. The conditions `sr_returned_date_sk = d2.d_date_sk` and the date range condition are now part of the join condition, which can lead to more efficient execution by potentially reducing the number of rows that need to be joined. Additionally, the conditions `d2.d_year = 2000` and `d2.d_moy = 7` are applied directly to the `date_dim d2` table, further optimizing the query by filtering the data at the earliest possible stage.

Query 3: The query uses `LIMIT` and `ORDER BY`, which matches the conditions of Rule 2. The transformation involves ensuring that the database engine efficiently handles the sorting and limiting operations. The query already uses `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT`, so the main focus is on ensuring that the sorting can leverage indexes if possible.

1. Ensure that the columns used in the `ORDER BY` clause are indexed to improve sorting performance.

Query Rewrite 1:
"""The query rewrite process can be explained as follows: The original SQL query had filter conditions in the `WHERE` clause that only involved columns from the `store_returns` and `date_dim d2` tables. According to Case 1 of the rewrite rule, these conditions can be moved into the `ON` clause of the `INNER JOIN` between these tables. This transformation optimizes the query by reducing the size of the datasets involved in the join operation, as the filtering is applied earlier in the query execution process. The conditions `sr_returned_date_sk = d2.d_date_sk` and the date range condition are now part of the join condition, which can lead to more efficient execution by potentially reducing the number of rows that need to be joined. Additionally, the conditions `d2.d_year = 2000` and `d2.d_moy = 7` are applied directly to the `date_dim d2` table, further optimizing the query by filtering the data at the earliest possible stage."""

Query Rewrite 2:
"""The query involves a `GROUP BY` operation and multiple `JOIN` operations. According to Rule 1, we can optimize the query by performing the `GROUP BY` operation earlier. This can be achieved by using subqueries to pre-aggregate data before joining. Here's how the transformation can be applied:

1. Create a subquery that performs the `GROUP BY` and `SUM` operations on the `store_sales` and `store_returns` tables before joining with the `store` and `date_dim` tables.
2. This reduces the size of the dataset that needs to be joined, potentially improving performance.

The filter's expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN.

The first strategy involves moving filter conditions from the `WHERE` clause to the `ON` clause of the `INNER JOIN` between `store_returns` and `date_dim d2` tables, which reduces the dataset size early in the execution process by applying filters sooner. This includes conditions like `sr_returned_date_sk = d2.d_date_sk` and date-specific filters, optimizing the query by limiting the data at the earliest stage. The second strategy suggests performing `GROUP BY` and `SUM` operations in a subquery before joining with other tables, thus reducing the dataset size before the join operations and potentially improving performance. This involves creating a `WITH` clause to pre-aggregate data from `store_sales` and `store_returns`. The third strategy focuses on ensuring efficient handling of `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT` operations by leveraging indexes on the columns used in the `ORDER BY` clause, which can enhance sorting performance and ensure the database engine efficiently retrieves the limited number of rows specified. Together, these strategies aim to optimize the query by reducing data size early, pre-aggregating data, and ensuring efficient sorting and limiting operations."""\n\nQuery Rewrite Rules:\n### Rule FILTER_INTO_JOIN:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: This SQL query rewrite rule applies when a filter condition is placed on the result set of an INNER JOIN operation. The filter\'s expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there\'s a matching row in the non-preserving side\'s table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side.

Identify the INNER JOIN or LEFT JOIN condition in the SQL query. 2. Extract the ON clause representing the join condition. 3.

For LEFT JOIN: - Replace the LEFT JOIN with a LEFT OUTER JOIN subquery that is correlated to the outer query. In the SELECT clause of the outer query, include a CASE statement or similar logic to handle selection from the subquery result. - Example Transformation: SELECT left_table.*, right_table.* FROM left_table LEFT JOIN right_table ON left_table.id = right_table.foreign_id Becomes: SELECT left_table.*, COALESCE(subquery.alias1, \'default\') FROM left_table LEFT OUTER JOIN (SELECT foreign_id, column1 AS alias1 FROM right_table) subquery ON left_table.id = subquery.foreign_id"""'}], 'response': 'Step 1: Evaluate each suggestion against the provided query rewrite rules.\n\n- **Suggestion 1** involves three strategies:\n  1.

The first strategy involves moving filter conditions from the `WHERE` clause to the `ON` clause of the `INNER JOIN` between `store_returns` and `date_dim d2` tables, which reduces the dataset size early in the execution process by applying filters sooner. This includes conditions like `sr_returned_date_sk = d2.d_date_sk` and date-specific filters, optimizing the query by limiting the data at the earliest stage. The second strategy suggests performing `GROUP BY` and `SUM` operations in a subquery before joining with other tables, thus reducing the dataset size before the join operations and potentially improving performance. This involves creating a `WITH` clause to pre-aggregate data from `store_sales` and `store_returns`. The third strategy focuses on ensuring efficient handling of `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT` operations by leveraging indexes on the columns used in the `ORDER BY` clause, which can enhance sorting performance and ensure the database engine efficiently retrieves the limited number of rows specified. Together, these strategies aim to optimize the query by reducing data size early, pre-aggregating data, and ensuring efficient sorting and limiting operations."""\n\nQuery Rewrite Rules:\n### Rule FILTER_INTO_JOIN:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: This SQL query rewrite rule applies when a filter condition is placed on the result set of an INNER JOIN operation. The filter\'s expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there\'s a matching row in the non-preserving side\'s table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned."""\n\nRule Subset Sequences:\n### Rule Sequence 1: ["FILTER_INTO_JOIN"]\n\n### Rule Sequence 2: ["FILTER_INTO_JOIN"]'}], 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'stream': False, 'temperature': 0.1}}

The first strategy involves moving filter conditions from the `WHERE` clause to the `ON` clause of the `INNER JOIN` between `store_returns` and `date_dim d2` tables, which reduces the dataset size early in the execution process by applying filters sooner. This includes conditions like `sr_returned_date_sk = d2.d_date_sk` and date-specific filters, optimizing the query by limiting the data at the earliest stage. The second strategy suggests performing `GROUP BY` and `SUM` operations in a subquery before joining with other tables, thus reducing the dataset size before the join operations and potentially improving performance. This involves creating a `WITH` clause to pre-aggregate data from `store_sales` and `store_returns`. The third strategy focuses on ensuring efficient handling of `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT` operations by leveraging indexes on the columns used in the `ORDER BY` clause, which can enhance sorting performance and ensure the database engine efficiently retrieves the limited number of rows specified. Together, these strategies aim to optimize the query by reducing data size early, pre-aggregating data, and ensuring efficient sorting and limiting operations."""\n\nQuery Rewrite Rules:\n### Rule FILTER_INTO_JOIN:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: This SQL query rewrite rule applies when a filter condition is placed on the result set of an INNER JOIN operation. The filter\'s expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there\'s a matching row in the non-preserving side\'s table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned."""\n\nArranged Rule Sequence: ["FILTER_INTO_JOIN"]\n\nUtilized Rules: ["FILTER_INTO_JOIN"]\n\nUnutilized Rules: []'}], 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'stream': False, 'temperature': 0.1}}
