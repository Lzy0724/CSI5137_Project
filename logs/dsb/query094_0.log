When the `LIMIT` clause is used to fetch a specified number of rows.\n2. When `ORDER BY` is used in conjunction with `LIMIT` to sort and limit the number of rows retrieved, particularly when sorting can leverage an index.\n3. When `DISTINCT` is used along with `LIMIT` to quickly identify and return unique rows without scanning the full dataset.\n4. During the use of `GROUP BY`, where optimization might involve sorting or traversing indexes in order to efficiently compute group values without processing the entire dataset.\n5. When sorting a specific number of rows from a single table based on non-indexed columns, utilizing in-memory sorting (`filesort`) techniques.\n**Transformations**: The specific SQL transformations that emerge from applying these optimization rules are:\n1. Combining `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY` encourages the database engine to stop the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained, avoiding full table sorts.\n2. Using `LIMIT` with `DISTINCT` leads to an early termination of the search for unique rows as soon as the needed amount is gathered, reducing time and resources spent on scanning the entire dataset.\n3. In the context of `GROUP BY`, optimizations may include indexing strategies or modifications to the way sorting is handled, such as employing `filesort` mechanisms that do not require temporary tables, ensuring that the database engine processes only the necessary data for group computations.\n4. Efficiencies are gained by encouraging the use of indexed columns with `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT`, making queries more efficient by reducing the cost associated with sorting and filtering operations.\n"""\nRule 3:\n"""\n**Conditions**: The SQL query rewrite rule applies when a query uses `DISTINCT` to remove duplicates, especially in the presence of multiple columns and when `ORDER BY` is involved. Additionally, this rule is particularly relevant when the columns in the `DISTINCT` query are supported by indexes.\n**Transformations**: - Rewriting the query to replace `DISTINCT` with a `GROUP BY` clause on the same columns used in the `DISTINCT` operation. This can improve execution efficiency by potentially taking advantage of indexes on these columns more effectively.\n- Ensuring that indexes match the columns specified in the `DISTINCT` operations to facilitate more efficient query processing. This transformation aims to reduce the need for the creation of temporary tables and, in turn, speed up query execution.\n"""\nRule 4:\n"""\n**Conditions**: The SQL query rewrite rule applies when there are:\n- Functions or operations (especially deterministic ones) within the SELECT, WHERE, JOIN conditions, or any part of the query that is executed multiple times for the same row.\n- The presence of potentially computationally expensive operations or function calls that are not dependent on the data of the specific row and thus can be optimized.\n**Transformations**: 1. Move repeated function calls or operations outside of loops, if applicable. For example, if a function that generates a calculated value based on constants or parameters (not row-specific data) is being called in a loop, calculate the value once before the loop and store the result for reuse.\n   \n2. Replace inline functions in the SELECT or WHERE clause with a pre-calculated column if the function is deterministic and the input data does not change frequently. This might involve:\n   - Creating a temporary table that includes the results of the expensive function calls.\n   - Using a subquery or a Common Table Expression (CTE) that calculates the value once and then joins it with the main query.\n   \n3. When using aggregate functions that are called multiple times with the same parameters, consider storing the result in a variable or a temporary table, especially if the data set is large.\n\n4. Avoid using functions on indexed columns in the WHERE clause. This prevents the database from using the index efficiently. If a function must be used, consider creating a computed column that pre-calculates the function\'s result and index that column instead.\n\n5. If possible, simplify expressions and calculations to reduce their complexity and execution time. This might involve algebraic simplification or breaking down complex calculations into simpler parts that can be calculated separately and then combined.\n\nExample:\nOriginal Query:\n```sql\nSELECT id, name, expensive_function(column) as expensive_result\nFROM table\nWHERE expensive_function(column) > 100;\n```\n\nTransformed Query using a CTE:\n```sql\nWITH PreCalculated AS (\n  SELECT id, name, column, expensive_function(column) as expensive_result\n  FROM table\n)\nSELECT id, name, expensive_sel as expensive_result\nFROM PreCalculated\nWHERE expensive_result > 100;\n```\n"""\nRule 5:\n"""\n**Conditions**: The rule applies when the original SQL query performs multiple scans or joins on the same table to retrieve different attributes for certain conditions, or when the query structure results in redundant data processing and complexity that could be reduced.\n**Transformations**: - Combine multiple joins into a single join operation by using `CASE` statements to conditionally select different attributes from the table in one pass. \n- Use the `COALESCE` function in conjunction with `CASE` statements to efficiently merge conditional attributes into distinct columns based on specific criteria without the need for additional joins.\n- Optimize the selection of conditional attributes by integrating `GROUP BY` with aggregate functions like `MAX` within `CASE` statements, thus condensing the result set to only the necessary data and avoiding needless retrieval and processing steps.\n- The overall transformation leads to a single, more efficient query that accomplishes the tasks of multiple, less efficient operations, improving performance, and simplifying the query for better readability and maintenance.\n"""'}], 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'stream': False, 'temperature': 0.1}}

The `EXISTS` sub-query has been converted into an `INNER JOIN`, and the `NOT EXISTS` sub-query has been converted into a `LEFT JOIN` with a filter for `IS NULL` to simulate the `NOT EXISTS` behavior.\n\nStep 2: Parsing the logical plan changes, we observe the following detailed changes in the SQL query:\n- The `EXISTS` sub-query:\n  ```sql\n  exists (select *\n          from web_sales ws2\n          where ws1.ws_order_number = ws2.ws_order_number\n            and ws1.ws_warehouse_sk <> ws2.ws_warehouse_sk)\n  ```\n  has been transformed into an `INNER JOIN`:\n  ```sql\n  INNER JOIN (SELECT ws_order_number FROM web_sales ws2 WHERE ws1.ws_order_number = ws2.ws_order_number AND ws1.ws_warehouse_sk <> ws2.ws_warehouse_sk)\n  ```\n- The `NOT EXISTS` sub-query:\n  ```sql\n  not exists(select *\n             from web_returns wr1\n             where ws1.ws_order_number = wr1.wr_order_number\n             and wr1.wr_reason_sk in (3, 6, 18, 30, 40))\n  ```\n  has been transformed into a `LEFT JOIN` with a filter for `IS NULL`:\n  ```sql\n  LEFT JOIN (SELECT wr_order_number FROM web_returns wr1 WHERE wr1.wr_reason_sk in (3, 6, 18, 30, 40)) ON ws1.ws_order_number = wr1.wr_order_number WHERE wr1.wr_order_number IS NULL\n  ```\n\nStep 3: The query rewrite rule contains multiple cases. Based on the parsed SQL query changes, the transformations match Case 2 of the query rewrite rule. This case deals with `EXISTS` and `NOT EXISTS` sub-queries, which are correlated with the outer query, and transforms them into join operations.\n\nStep 4: The SQL query changes can be explained as follows:\n- The `EXISTS` sub-query was originally checking for the existence of rows in `web_sales` where the `ws_order_number` matched and `ws_warehouse_sk` was different. This has been transformed into an `INNER JOIN` on `ws_order_number` with a condition to ensure `ws_warehouse_sk` is different, effectively filtering the rows that satisfy the `EXISTS` condition.\n- The `NOT EXISTS` sub-query was originally checking for the non-existence of rows in `web_returns` where the `ws_order_number` matched and `wr_reason_sk` was in a specific set. This has been transformed into a `LEFT JOIN` on `ws_order_number` with a condition to check for `IS NULL`, effectively filtering out rows that would have matched the `NOT EXISTS` condition.\n\nThese transformations optimize the query by replacing sub-queries with join operations, which can be more efficient for execution in SQL engines.', 'time': 5.950409650802612}

The original plan had a `LogicalAggregate` that grouped by an empty set and calculated aggregates directly on columns from a `LogicalProject`. The rewritten plan applies the `LogicalAggregate` directly to the columns from the `LogicalTableScan` without the intermediate `LogicalProject`. This suggests that the rewrite rule removed an unnecessary projection layer and directly applied the aggregation to the data source.\n\nStep 2: Parsing the logical plan changes, we see that the original query had a `LogicalProject` that selected `ws_order_number`, `ws_ext_ship_cost`, and `ws_net_profit` from `web_sales`. The rewrite removed this projection, and the `LogicalAggregate` now directly uses these columns from the `LogicalTableScan`. This indicates that the rewrite rule optimized the query by eliminating the intermediate projection and directly applying the aggregation functions to the data source.\n\nStep 3: The query rewrite rule contains two cases. Case 1 involves a `GROUP BY` clause with simple columns and direct aggregates, while Case 2 involves an outer query matching the columns used in an inner query's `GROUP BY` and aggregates. The given SQL query does not have a `GROUP BY` clause, and the aggregates are directly applied to columns without transformations. Therefore, Case 1 does not apply. However, the query does involve an outer query that matches the columns used in the aggregates, suggesting that Case 2 is applicable.\n\nStep 4: In Case 2, the rewrite rule removes the inner `SELECT` layer and directly applies the aggregate functions to the original data source. The logical plan changes reflect this by eliminating the `LogicalProject` and applying the `LogicalAggregate` directly to the `LogicalTableScan`. This optimization reduces the complexity of the query by removing unnecessary layers, allowing the aggregates to be computed directly on the data source. The SQL query changes involve removing the intermediate projection of `ws_order_number`, `ws_ext_ship_cost`, and `ws_net_profit`, and directly using these columns in the aggregation, which aligns with the transformations described in Case 2 of the rewrite rule.", 'time': 6.2209248542785645}

When the `LIMIT` clause is used to fetch a specified number of rows.\n2. When `ORDER BY` is used in conjunction with `LIMIT` to sort and limit the number of rows retrieved, particularly when sorting can leverage an index.\n3. When `DISTINCT` is used along with `LIMIT` to quickly identify and return unique rows without scanning the full dataset.\n4. During the use of `GROUP BY`, where optimization might involve sorting or traversing indexes in order to efficiently compute group values without processing the entire dataset.\n5. When sorting a specific number of rows from a single table based on non-indexed columns, utilizing in-memory sorting (`filesort`) techniques.\n**Transformations**: The specific SQL transformations that emerge from applying these optimization rules are:\n1. Combining `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY` encourages the database engine to stop the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained, avoiding full table sorts.\n2. Using `LIMIT` with `DISTINCT` leads to an early termination of the search for unique rows as soon as the needed amount is gathered, reducing time and resources spent on scanning the entire dataset.\n3. In the context of `GROUP BY`, optimizations may include indexing strategies or modifications to the way sorting is handled, such as employing `filesort` mechanisms that do not require temporary tables, ensuring that the database engine processes only the necessary data for group computations.\n4. Efficiencies are gained by encouraging the use of indexed columns with `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT`, making queries more efficient by reducing the cost associated with sorting and filtering operations.\n"""\nRule 3:\n"""\n**Conditions**: The SQL query rewrite rule applies when a query uses `DISTINCT` to remove duplicates, especially in the presence of multiple columns and when `ORDER BY` is involved. Additionally, this rule is particularly relevant when the columns in the `DISTINCT` query are supported by indexes.\n**Transformations**: - Rewriting the query to replace `DISTINCT` with a `GROUP BY` clause on the same columns used in the `DISTINCT` operation. This can improve execution efficiency by potentially taking advantage of indexes on these columns more effectively.\n- Ensuring that indexes match the columns specified in the `DISTINCT` operations to facilitate more efficient query processing. This transformation aims to reduce the need for the creation of temporary tables and, in turn, speed up query execution.\n"""\nRule 4:\n"""\n**Conditions**: The SQL query rewrite rule applies when there are:\n- Functions or operations (especially deterministic ones) within the SELECT, WHERE, JOIN conditions, or any part of the query that is executed multiple times for the same row.\n- The presence of potentially computationally expensive operations or function calls that are not dependent on the data of the specific row and thus can be optimized.\n**Transformations**: 1. Move repeated function calls or operations outside of loops, if applicable. For example, if a function that generates a calculated value based on constants or parameters (not row-specific data) is being called in a loop, calculate the value once before the loop and store the result for reuse.\n   \n2. Replace inline functions in the SELECT or WHERE clause with a pre-calculated column if the function is deterministic and the input data does not change frequently. This might involve:\n   - Creating a temporary table that includes the results of the expensive function calls.\n   - Using a subquery or a Common Table Expression (CTE) that calculates the value once and then joins it with the main query.\n   \n3. When using aggregate functions that are called multiple times with the same parameters, consider storing the result in a variable or a temporary table, especially if the data set is large.\n\n4. Avoid using functions on indexed columns in the WHERE clause. This prevents the database from using the index efficiently. If a function must be used, consider creating a computed column that pre-calculates the function\'s result and index that column instead.\n\n5. If possible, simplify expressions and calculations to reduce their complexity and execution time. This might involve algebraic simplification or breaking down complex calculations into simpler parts that can be calculated separately and then combined.\n\nExample:\nOriginal Query:\n```sql\nSELECT id, name, expensive_function(column) as expensive_result\nFROM table\nWHERE expensive_function(column) > 100;\n```\n\nTransformed Query using a CTE:\n```sql\nWITH PreCalculated AS (\n  SELECT id, name, column, expensive_function(column) as expensive_result\n  FROM table\n)\nSELECT id, name, expensive_sel as expensive_result\nFROM PreCalculated\nWHERE expensive_result > 100;\n```\n"""\nRule 5:\n"""\n**Conditions**: The rule applies when the original SQL query performs multiple scans or joins on the same table to retrieve different attributes for certain conditions, or when the query structure results in redundant data processing and complexity that could be reduced.\n**Transformations**: - Combine multiple joins into a single join operation by using `CASE` statements to conditionally select different attributes from the table in one pass. \n- Use the `COALESCE` function in conjunction with `CASE` statements to efficiently merge conditional attributes into distinct columns based on specific criteria without the need for additional joins.\n- Optimize the selection of conditional attributes by integrating `GROUP BY` with aggregate functions like `MAX` within `CASE` statements, thus condensing the result set to only the necessary data and avoiding needless retrieval and processing steps.\n- The overall transformation leads to a single, more efficient query that accomplishes the tasks of multiple, less efficient operations, improving performance, and simplifying the query for better readability and maintenance.\n"""'}], 'response': 'Step 1: Analyze the SQL query against each provided rewrite rule\'s conditions to determine applicability.\n\n- **Rule 1**: The query uses `EXISTS` and `NOT EXISTS`, which matches the conditions of Rule 1.

Query 1: In Case 2, the rewrite rule removes the inner `SELECT` layer and directly applies the aggregate functions to the original data source. The logical plan changes reflect this by eliminating the `LogicalProject` and applying the `LogicalAggregate` directly to the `LogicalTableScan`. This optimization reduces the complexity of the query by removing unnecessary layers, allowing the aggregates to be computed directly on the data source. The SQL query changes involve removing the intermediate projection of `ws_order_number`, `ws_ext_ship_cost`, and `ws_net_profit`, and directly using these columns in the aggregation, which aligns with the transformations described in Case 2 of the rewrite rule.
Query 2: The SQL query changes can be explained as follows:
- The `EXISTS` sub-query was originally checking for the existence of rows in `web_sales` where the `ws_order_number` matched and `ws_warehouse_sk` was different. This has been transformed into an `INNER JOIN` on `ws_order_number` with a condition to ensure `ws_warehouse_sk` is different, effectively filtering the rows that satisfy the `EXISTS` condition.
- The `NOT EXISTS` sub-query was originally checking for the non-existence of rows in `web_returns` where the `ws_order_number` matched and `wr_reason_sk` was in a specific set. This has been transformed into a `LEFT JOIN` on `ws_order_number` with a condition to check for `IS NULL`, effectively filtering out rows that would have matched the `NOT EXISTS` condition.

These transformations optimize the query by replacing sub-queries with join operations, which can be more efficient for execution in SQL engines.
Query 3: The query uses `EXISTS` and `NOT EXISTS`, which can be optimized using Rule 1's transformations. The `EXISTS` clause can be replaced with an `INTERSECT` operation, and the `NOT EXISTS` can be replaced with an `EXCEPT` operation. This transformation can potentially improve index usage and reduce execution time by minimizing duplicate row processing.

Original EXISTS clause:
```sql
exists (select *
        from web_sales ws2
        where ws1.ws_order_number = ws2.ws_order_number
          and ws1.ws_warehouse_sk <> ws2.ws_warehouse_sk)
```

Transformed using INTERSECT:
```sql
select ws_order_number
from web_sales ws2
where ws1.ws_order_number = ws2.ws_order_number
  and ws1.ws_warehouse_sk <> ws2.ws_warehouse_sk
INTERSECT
select ws_order_number
from web_sales
```

Original NOT EXISTS clause:
```sql
not exists(select *
           from web_returns wr1
           where ws1.ws_order_number = wr1.wr_order_number
           and wr1.wr_reason_sk in (3, 6, 18, 30, 40))
```

Transformed using EXCEPT:
```sql
select ws_order_number
from web_sales
EXCEPT
select wr_order_number
from web_returns wr1
where wr1.wr_reason_sk in (3, 6, 18, 30, 40)
```
Query 4: The query uses `LIMIT` and `ORDER BY`, which can be optimized using Rule 2's transformations. By combining `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY`, the database engine can stop the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained, avoiding full table sorts. This transformation encourages efficient use of indexes and reduces the cost associated with sorting and filtering operations.

The transformation does not require changes to the SQL syntax but rather relies on the database engine's optimization capabilities. The query remains the same, but the execution plan may be optimized to leverage these conditions.
Query 5: The query uses `DISTINCT` in conjunction with `ORDER BY`, which can be optimized using Rule 3's transformations. Rewriting the query to replace `DISTINCT` with a `GROUP BY` clause on the same columns used in the `DISTINCT` operation can improve execution efficiency by potentially taking advantage of indexes more effectively.

Original DISTINCT clause:
```sql
count(distinct ws_order_number) as "order count"
```

Transformed using GROUP BY:
```sql
select 
   count(ws_order_number) as "order count"
from
   (select ws_order_number
    from web_sales
    group by ws_order_number) as distinct_orders
```

This transformation assumes that indexes on `ws_order_number` are available to facilitate efficient query processing.

"""In Case 2, the rewrite rule removes the inner `SELECT` layer and directly applies the aggregate functions to the original data source. The logical plan changes reflect this by eliminating the `LogicalProject` and applying the `LogicalAggregate` directly to the `LogicalTableScan`. This optimization reduces the complexity of the query by removing unnecessary layers, allowing the aggregates to be computed directly on the data source. The SQL query changes involve removing the intermediate projection of `ws_order_number`, `ws_ext_ship_cost`, and `ws_net_profit`, and directly using these columns in the aggregation, which aligns with the transformations described in Case 2 of the rewrite rule."""

Query Rewrite 2:
"""The SQL query changes can be explained as follows:
- The `EXISTS` sub-query was originally checking for the existence of rows in `web_sales` where the `ws_order_number` matched and `ws_warehouse_sk` was different. This has been transformed into an `INNER JOIN` on `ws_order_number` with a condition to ensure `ws_warehouse_sk` is different, effectively filtering the rows that satisfy the `EXISTS` condition.
- The `NOT EXISTS` sub-query was originally checking for the non-existence of rows in `web_returns` where the `ws_order_number` matched and `wr_reason_sk` was in a specific set. This has been transformed into a `LEFT JOIN` on `ws_order_number` with a condition to check for `IS NULL`, effectively filtering out rows that would have matched the `NOT EXISTS` condition.

These transformations optimize the query by replacing sub-queries with join operations, which can be more efficient for execution in SQL engines."""

Query Rewrite 3:
"""The query uses `EXISTS` and `NOT EXISTS`, which can be optimized using Rule 1's transformations. The `EXISTS` clause can be replaced with an `INTERSECT` operation, and the `NOT EXISTS` can be replaced with an `EXCEPT` operation. This transformation can potentially improve index usage and reduce execution time by minimizing duplicate row processing.

Original EXISTS clause:
```sql
exists (select *
        from web_sales ws2
        where ws1.ws_order_number = ws2.ws_order_number
          and ws1.ws_warehouse_sk <> ws2.ws_warehouse_sk)

Transformed using INTERSECT:
```sql
select ws_order_number
from web_sales ws2
where ws1.ws_order_number = ws2.ws_order_number
  and ws1.ws_warehouse_sk <> ws2.ws_warehouse_sk
INTERSECT
select ws_order_number
from web_sales
```

Original NOT EXISTS clause:
```sql
not exists(select *
           from web_returns wr1
           where ws1.ws_order_number = wr1.wr_order_number
           and wr1.wr_reason_sk in (3, 6, 18, 30, 40))
```

Transformed using EXCEPT:
```sql
select ws_order_number
from web_sales
EXCEPT
select wr_order_number
from web_returns wr1
where wr1.wr_reason_sk in (3, 6, 18, 30, 40)
```"""

Query Rewrite 4:
"""The query uses `LIMIT` and `ORDER BY`, which can be optimized using Rule 2's transformations. By combining `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY`, the database engine can stop the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained, avoiding full table sorts. This transformation encourages efficient use of indexes and reduces the cost associated with sorting and filtering operations.

The transformation does not require changes to the SQL syntax but rather relies on the database engine's optimization capabilities. The query remains the same, but the execution plan may be optimized to leverage these conditions."""

Query Rewrite 5:
"""The query uses `DISTINCT` in conjunction with `ORDER BY`, which can be optimized using Rule 3's transformations. Rewriting the query to replace `DISTINCT` with a `GROUP BY` clause on the same columns used in the `DISTINCT` operation can improve execution efficiency by potentially taking advantage of indexes more effectively.

Original DISTINCT clause:
```sql
count(distinct ws_order_number) as "order count"
```

Transformed using GROUP BY:
```sql
select 
   count(ws_order_number) as "order count"
from
   (select ws_order_number
    from web_sales
    group by ws_order_number) as distinct_orders

The first strategy involves transforming sub-queries into join operations. Specifically, the `EXISTS` sub-query, which checks for matching `ws_order_number` with different `ws_warehouse_sk`, is replaced by an `INNER JOIN`, while the `NOT EXISTS` sub-query, which checks for non-matching `ws_order_number` in `web_returns` with specific `wr_reason_sk`, is replaced by a `LEFT JOIN` with an `IS NULL` condition. These transformations can enhance query performance by leveraging more efficient join operations. The second strategy suggests using set operations like `INTERSECT` and `EXCEPT` to replace `EXISTS` and `NOT EXISTS` clauses, respectively. This approach can improve index usage and reduce execution time by minimizing duplicate row processing, potentially leading to faster query execution. Both strategies aim to optimize the query by reducing the computational overhead associated with sub-queries."""\n\n### Suggestion 2:\n"""The provided SQL query can be optimized using two main strategies. The first strategy involves simplifying the query by removing unnecessary layers of nested `SELECT` statements and directly applying aggregate functions to the original data source. This is achieved by eliminating the `LogicalProject` and applying the `LogicalAggregate` directly to the `LogicalTableScan`, thereby reducing query complexity and improving performance. The second strategy focuses on optimizing the use of `DISTINCT` in conjunction with `ORDER BY` by replacing the `DISTINCT` clause with a `GROUP BY` clause on the same columns. This transformation can enhance execution efficiency by leveraging available indexes on the `ws_order_number`, facilitating more efficient query processing. Together, these strategies aim to streamline the query execution and improve performance by reducing complexity and optimizing the use of database indexes."""\n\n### Suggestion 3:\n"""The query uses `LIMIT` and `ORDER BY`, which can be optimized using Rule 2\'s transformations. By combining `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY`, the database engine can stop the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained, avoiding full table sorts. This transformation encourages efficient use of indexes and reduces the cost associated with sorting and filtering operations.\n\nThe transformation does not require changes to the SQL syntax but rather relies on the database engine\'s optimization capabilities.

These transformations can enhance query performance by leveraging more efficient join operations. The second strategy suggests using set operations like `INTERSECT` and `EXCEPT` to replace `EXISTS` and `NOT EXISTS` clauses, respectively.

The second strategy focuses on optimizing the use of `DISTINCT` in conjunction with `ORDER BY` by replacing the `DISTINCT` clause with a `GROUP BY` clause on the same columns.

This aligns with the **AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE** and **AGGREGATE_EXPAND_DISTINCT_AGGREGATES_TO_JOIN** rules, which focus on merging aggregates and expanding distinct aggregates.\n\n3. **Suggestion 3** focuses on optimizing `LIMIT` and `ORDER BY`, which is more about execution plan optimization rather than a specific rule transformation.\n\nGiven the rule subset sequences:\n- **Rule Sequence 1**: ["AGGREGATE_EXPAND_DISTINCT_AGGREGATES_TO_JOIN", "AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE"]\n- **Rule Sequence 2**: ["FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE"]\n- **Rule Sequence 3**: ["FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE"]\n- **Rule Sequence 4**: ["AGGREGATE_EXPAND_DISTINCT_AGGREGATES_TO_JOIN"]\n- **Rule Sequence 5**: ["AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE"]\n\nWe can deduce the overall sequence by considering the dependencies and logical flow of transformations:\n\n1. **FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE** should be applied first to transform sub-queries into joins, as suggested by Suggestion 1 and supported by Rule Sequences 2 and 3.\n\n2. **AGGREGATE_EXPAND_DISTINCT_AGGREGATES_TO_JOIN** should follow to handle distinct aggregates, as indicated by Rule Sequences 1 and 4.\n\n3. **AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE** should be applied last to merge aggregate operations and simplify the query structure, as indicated by Rule Sequences 1 and 5.\n\nThus, the overall sequence of rules to optimize the query is:\n\n```python\n["FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE", "AGGREGATE_EXPAND_DISTINCT_AGGREGATES_TO_JOIN", "AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE"]\n```', 'time': 5.00303316116333}

The first strategy involves transforming sub-queries into join operations. Specifically, the `EXISTS` sub-query, which checks for matching `ws_order_number` with different `ws_warehouse_sk`, is replaced by an `INNER JOIN`, while the `NOT EXISTS` sub-query, which checks for non-matching `ws_order_number` in `web_returns` with specific `wr_reason_sk`, is replaced by a `LEFT JOIN` with an `IS NULL` condition. These transformations can enhance query performance by leveraging more efficient join operations. The second strategy suggests using set operations like `INTERSECT` and `EXCEPT` to replace `EXISTS` and `NOT EXISTS` clauses, respectively. This approach can improve index usage and reduce execution time by minimizing duplicate row processing, potentially leading to faster query execution. Both strategies aim to optimize the query by reducing the computational overhead associated with sub-queries."""\n\n### Suggestion 2:\n"""The provided SQL query can be optimized using two main strategies. The first strategy involves simplifying the query by removing unnecessary layers of nested `SELECT` statements and directly applying aggregate functions to the original data source. This is achieved by eliminating the `LogicalProject` and applying the `LogicalAggregate` directly to the `LogicalTableScan`, thereby reducing query complexity and improving performance. The second strategy focuses on optimizing the use of `DISTINCT` in conjunction with `ORDER BY` by replacing the `DISTINCT` clause with a `GROUP BY` clause on the same columns. This transformation can enhance execution efficiency by leveraging available indexes on the `ws_order_number`, facilitating more efficient query processing. Together, these strategies aim to streamline the query execution and improve performance by reducing complexity and optimizing the use of database indexes."""\n\n### Suggestion 3:\n"""The query uses `LIMIT` and `ORDER BY`, which can be optimized using Rule 2\'s transformations. By combining `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY`, the database engine can stop the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained, avoiding full table sorts. This transformation encourages efficient use of indexes and reduces the cost associated with sorting and filtering operations.\n\nThe transformation does not require changes to the SQL syntax but rather relies on the database engine\'s optimization capabilities. The query remains the same, but the execution plan may be optimized to leverage these conditions."""\n\nQuery Rewrite Rules:\n### Rule AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: - The SQL query contains a `GROUP BY` clause that groups by simple columns (no expressions in the `GROUP BY` list).\n- The aggregate functions in the `SELECT` clause operate directly on columns (no expressions inside the aggregate functions).\n- The `SELECT` clause only contains the columns used in the `GROUP BY` clause and the aggregates without any transformations or additional expressions.\n**Transformations**: - Directly apply the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions to the data source referred to in the `FROM` clause of the inner query before the projection.\n- Eliminate the outer projection layer if it only renames the columns without transforming them.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: - The `SELECT` clause of an outer query precisely matches the columns used in the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions of an inner query, without any column transformations or renamings.\n- The inner `SELECT` only serves as a passthrough for these columns.\n**Transformations**: - Remove the inner `SELECT` layer, directly applying the aggregate functions and `GROUP BY` to the original data source."""\n\n### Rule FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: The query contains a scalar sub-query within the WHERE clause.\n**Transformations**: The scalar sub-query should be transformed into a LEFT JOIN operation with an aggregate function on the column(s) being selected in the sub-query. The JOIN condition uses the correlation ID (the matching column(s) in both outer and sub-query).\n  - Original Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 WHERE column = (SELECT AGG_FUNCTION(column2) FROM table2 WHERE table1.join_column = table2.join_column)\n  - Transformed Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 LEFT JOIN (SELECT join_column, AGG_FUNCTION(column2) AS agg_result FROM table2 GROUP BY join_column) AS sub_query ON table1.join_column = sub_query.join_column WHERE column = sub_query.agg_result\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: The query contains `IN`, `EXISTS`, or `UNIQUE` sub-queries within the WHERE clause that are correlated with the outer query.\n**Transformations**: - For `IN` Sub-queries: Replace the `IN` clause with a JOIN operation and a WHERE condition that checks for non-null values on the side of the sub-query.\n    - Original Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 WHERE column IN (SELECT column2 FROM table2 WHERE table1.join_column = table2.join_column)\n    - Transformed Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.join_column = table2.join_column WHERE table2.column2 IS NOT NULL\n  - For `EXISTS` Sub-queries: Convert the `EXISTS` condition into a JOIN operation, using WHERE to filter rows that match the JOIN condition.\n    - Original Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM table2 WHERE table1.join_column = table2.join_class)\n    - Transformed Query Structure: SELECT DISTINCT table1.* FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.join_column = table2.join_column\n  - For `UNIQUE` Sub-queries: Since `UNIQUE` requires a bit more complex handling not directly mappable to a standard JOIN, it should be considered a special case where the goal is to ensure that rows from the outer query match a unique set in the sub-query. This might not translate directly into SQL syntax without additional sub-query or DISTINCT aggregation."""\n\n### Rule AGGREGATE_EXPAND_DISTINCT_AGGREGATES_TO_JOIN:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: If a SQL query uses strictly COUNT(DISTINCT column), SUM(DISTINCT column), MIN(DISTINCT column), or MAX(DISTINCT column) with the same column, and does not include any non-distinct aggregate functions in the SELECT clause, it can be processed without a join operator.\n**Transformations**: The SQL optimization here involves simplifying the aggregation logic to work over a single group by operation, directly translating to the use of GROUP BY on that column in SQL.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: If a SQL query contains exactly one distinct aggregate function (e.g., COUNT(DISTINCT column)) and one or more non-distinct aggregates (COUNT, SUM, MIN, MAX) on distinct or the same columns without any filters, it should be transformed as follows: 1. Generate an intermediate SQL query (bottom Aggregate) that groups by both the distinct column(s) and any columns involved in the GROUP BY clause, calculating all distinct aggregates at this stage. 2. Apply a second SQL query (top Aggregate) on top of the intermediate result to compute non-distinct aggregates. 3. If the original query contains operations that logically precede the aggregation (e.g., joins with other tables), incorporate these as necessary before the bottom Aggregate, possibly leading to a join operation. 4. Use a SELECT statement (final Project) to realign the output columns if necessary to match the original query\'s expected output.\n**Transformations**: Generate an intermediate SQL query that groups by the distinct and group by columns for distinct aggregates then apply another aggregation on this result for non-distinct aggregates. Join operational tables as necessary before aggregation\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: For SQL queries involving multiple distinct aggregate functions over different columns (e.g., COUNT(DISTINCT column_a), COUNT(DISTINCT column_b)), the transformation should proceed as follows: 1. Decompose the query into multiple parts, each part handling one of the distinct aggregates. Each part will effectively be an intermediate SQL query that performs a GROUP BY on the distinct column related to its aggregate. 2. Use JOIN operations to combine these intermediate aggregate results based on the common grouping columns that are part of the original GROUP BY clause, if present. 3. Rewrite the initial distinct aggregates in the final SELECT statement to reference the appropriate aggregated results from the combined dataset without using the DISTINCT keyword. 4. Include a final SELECT statement (Project) to ensure that the output columns are correctly named and typed to match the expected result set of the original query.\n**Transformations**: Decompose the query into parts for each distinct aggregate and GROUP BY the related distinct column. Use JOIN to combine these results based on the common group by columns. Reference the combined dataset aggregates without DISTINCT in the final SELECT to match the original expected result."""\n\nArranged Rule Sequence: ["FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE", "AGGREGATE_EXPAND_DISTINCT_AGGREGATES_TO_JOIN", "AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE"]\n\nUtilized Rules: ["FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE", "AGGREGATE_EXPAND_DISTINCT_AGGREGATES_TO_JOIN", "AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE"]\n\nUnutilized Rules: []'}], 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'stream': False, 'temperature': 0.1}}

The first strategy involves transforming sub-queries into join operations. Specifically, the `EXISTS` sub-query, which checks for matching `ws_order_number` with different `ws_warehouse_sk`, is replaced by an `INNER JOIN`, while the `NOT EXISTS` sub-query, which checks for non-matching `ws_order_number` in `web_returns` with specific `wr_reason_sk`, is replaced by a `LEFT JOIN` with an `IS NULL` condition. These transformations can enhance query performance by leveraging more efficient join operations. The second strategy suggests using set operations like `INTERSECT` and `EXCEPT` to replace `EXISTS` and `NOT EXISTS` clauses, respectively. This approach can improve index usage and reduce execution time by minimizing duplicate row processing, potentially leading to faster query execution. Both strategies aim to optimize the query by reducing the computational overhead associated with sub-queries."""\n\n### Suggestion 2:\n"""The provided SQL query can be optimized using two main strategies. The first strategy involves simplifying the query by removing unnecessary layers of nested `SELECT` statements and directly applying aggregate functions to the original data source. This is achieved by eliminating the `LogicalProject` and applying the `LogicalAggregate` directly to the `LogicalTableScan`, thereby reducing query complexity and improving performance. The second strategy focuses on optimizing the use of `DISTINCT` in conjunction with `ORDER BY` by replacing the `DISTINCT` clause with a `GROUP BY` clause on the same columns. This transformation can enhance execution efficiency by leveraging available indexes on the `ws_order_number`, facilitating more efficient query processing. Together, these strategies aim to streamline the query execution and improve performance by reducing complexity and optimizing the use of database indexes."""\n\n### Suggestion 3:\n"""The query uses `LIMIT` and `ORDER BY`, which can be optimized using Rule 2\'s transformations. By combining `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY`, the database engine can stop the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained, avoiding full table sorts. This transformation encourages efficient use of indexes and reduces the cost associated with sorting and filtering operations.\n\nThe transformation does not require changes to the SQL syntax but rather relies on the database engine\'s optimization capabilities. The query remains the same, but the execution plan may be optimized to leverage these conditions."""\n\nQuery Rewrite Rules:\n### Rule AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: - The SQL query contains a `GROUP BY` clause that groups by simple columns (no expressions in the `GROUP BY` list).\n- The aggregate functions in the `SELECT` clause operate directly on columns (no expressions inside the aggregate functions).\n- The `SELECT` clause only contains the columns used in the `GROUP BY` clause and the aggregates without any transformations or additional expressions.\n**Transformations**: - Directly apply the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions to the data source referred to in the `FROM` clause of the inner query before the projection.\n- Eliminate the outer projection layer if it only renames the columns without transforming them.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: - The `SELECT` clause of an outer query precisely matches the columns used in the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions of an inner query, without any column transformations or renamings.\n- The inner `SELECT` only serves as a passthrough for these columns.\n**Transformations**: - Remove the inner `SELECT` layer, directly applying the aggregate functions and `GROUP BY` to the original data source."""\n\n### Rule FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: The query contains a scalar sub-query within the WHERE clause.\n**Transformations**: The scalar sub-query should be transformed into a LEFT JOIN operation with an aggregate function on the column(s) being selected in the sub-query. The JOIN condition uses the correlation ID (the matching column(s) in both outer and sub-query).\n  - Original Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 WHERE column = (SELECT AGG_FUNCTION(column2) FROM table2 WHERE table1.join_column = table2.join_column)\n  - Transformed Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 LEFT JOIN (SELECT join_column, AGG_FUNCTION(column2) AS agg_result FROM table2 GROUP BY join_column) AS sub_query ON table1.join_column = sub_query.join_column WHERE column = sub_query.agg_result\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: The query contains `IN`, `EXISTS`, or `UNIQUE` sub-queries within the WHERE clause that are correlated with the outer query.\n**Transformations**: - For `IN` Sub-queries: Replace the `IN` clause with a JOIN operation and a WHERE condition that checks for non-null values on the side of the sub-query.\n    - Original Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 WHERE column IN (SELECT column2 FROM table2 WHERE table1.join_column = table2.join_column)\n    - Transformed Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.join_column = table2.join_column WHERE table2.column2 IS NOT NULL\n  - For `EXISTS` Sub-queries: Convert the `EXISTS` condition into a JOIN operation, using WHERE to filter rows that match the JOIN condition.\n    - Original Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM table2 WHERE table1.join_column = table2.join_class)\n    - Transformed Query Structure: SELECT DISTINCT table1.* FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.join_column = table2.join_column\n  - For `UNIQUE` Sub-queries: Since `UNIQUE` requires a bit more complex handling not directly mappable to a standard JOIN, it should be considered a special case where the goal is to ensure that rows from the outer query match a unique set in the sub-query. This might not translate directly into SQL syntax without additional sub-query or DISTINCT aggregation."""\n\n### Rule AGGREGATE_EXPAND_DISTINCT_AGGREGATES_TO_JOIN:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: If a SQL query uses strictly COUNT(DISTINCT column), SUM(DISTINCT column), MIN(DISTINCT column), or MAX(DISTINCT column) with the same column, and does not include any non-distinct aggregate functions in the SELECT clause, it can be processed without a join operator.\n**Transformations**: The SQL optimization here involves simplifying the aggregation logic to work over a single group by operation, directly translating to the use of GROUP BY on that column in SQL.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: If a SQL query contains exactly one distinct aggregate function (e.g., COUNT(DISTINCT column)) and one or more non-distinct aggregates (COUNT, SUM, MIN, MAX) on distinct or the same columns without any filters, it should be transformed as follows: 1. Generate an intermediate SQL query (bottom Aggregate) that groups by both the distinct column(s) and any columns involved in the GROUP BY clause, calculating all distinct aggregates at this stage. 2. Apply a second SQL query (top Aggregate) on top of the intermediate result to compute non-distinct aggregates. 3. If the original query contains operations that logically precede the aggregation (e.g., joins with other tables), incorporate these as necessary before the bottom Aggregate, possibly leading to a join operation. 4. Use a SELECT statement (final Project) to realign the output columns if necessary to match the original query\'s expected output.\n**Transformations**: Generate an intermediate SQL query that groups by the distinct and group by columns for distinct aggregates then apply another aggregation on this result for non-distinct aggregates. Join operational tables as necessary before aggregation\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: For SQL queries involving multiple distinct aggregate functions over different columns (e.g., COUNT(DISTINCT column_a), COUNT(DISTINCT column_b)), the transformation should proceed as follows: 1. Decompose the query into multiple parts, each part handling one of the distinct aggregates. Each part will effectively be an intermediate SQL query that performs a GROUP BY on the distinct column related to its aggregate. 2. Use JOIN operations to combine these intermediate aggregate results based on the common grouping columns that are part of the original GROUP BY clause, if present. 3. Rewrite the initial distinct aggregates in the final SELECT statement to reference the appropriate aggregated results from the combined dataset without using the DISTINCT keyword. 4. Include a final SELECT statement (Project) to ensure that the output columns are correctly named and typed to match the expected result set of the original query.\n**Transformations**: Decompose the query into parts for each distinct aggregate and GROUP BY the related distinct column. Use JOIN to combine these results based on the common group by columns. Reference the combined dataset aggregates without DISTINCT in the final SELECT to match the original expected result."""\n\nArranged Rule Sequence: ["FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE", "AGGREGATE_EXPAND_DISTINCT_AGGREGATES_TO_JOIN", "AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE"]\n\nUtilized Rules: ["FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE", "AGGREGATE_EXPAND_DISTINCT_AGGREGATES_TO_JOIN", "AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE"]\n\nUnutilized Rules: []'}], 'response': 'Step 1: Since there are no unutilized rules in the provided arrangement, we cannot prioritize any unutilized potential rules over the utilized ones.
