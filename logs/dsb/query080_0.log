Replace IN with INTERSECT for querying intersecting datasets to potentially improve index usage and query speed.\n- Rewrite conditions using the OR operator into a series of UNION ALL operations to enhance code maintainability and performance.\n- Use EXCEPT instead of NOT IN or anti-joins to minimize duplicate row processing and optimize resource use, effectively reducing execution time.\n"""\nRule 2:\n"""\n**Conditions**: - The SQL query performs a `GROUP BY` operation along with other operations like `JOIN`.\n- Query performance could be enhanced by reducing the size of intermediate datasets.\n- Suitable for queries involving large datasets or attributes from Entity-Attribute-Value (EAV) tables.\n- Applicable when reordering the sequence of operations can lead to performance improvements.\n**Transformations**: - Rearrange the query to perform `GROUP BY` operations at the earliest stage, ideally before executing operations like `JOIN`.\n- Utilize subqueries for pre-aggregation to reduce the dataset size early in the execution process.\n- Directly restructure the query to prioritize grouping operations to minimize the workload on subsequent operations like `JOIN`, thereby enhancing overall execution speed and efficiency.\n"""\nRule 3:\n"""\n**Conditions**: The SQL query optimization rules apply under the following conditions:\n1. When the `LIMIT` clause is used to fetch a specified number of rows.\n2. When `ORDER BY` is used in conjunction with `LIMIT` to sort and limit the number of rows retrieved, particularly when sorting can leverage an index.\n3. When `DISTINCT` is used along with `LIMIT` to quickly identify and return unique rows without scanning the full dataset.\n4. During the use of `GROUP BY`, where optimization might involve sorting or traversing indexes in order to efficiently compute group values without processing the entire dataset.\n5. When sorting a specific number of rows from a single table based on non-indexed columns, utilizing in-memory sorting (`filesort`) techniques.\n**Transformations**: The specific SQL transformations that emerge from applying these optimization rules are:\n1. Combining `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY` encourages the database engine to stop the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained, avoiding full table sorts.\n2. Using `LIMIT` with `DISTINCT` leads to an early termination of the search for unique rows as soon as the needed amount is gathered, reducing time and resources spent on scanning the entire dataset.\n3. In the context of `GROUP BY`, optimizations may include indexing strategies or modifications to the way sorting is handled, such as employing `filesort` mechanisms that do not require temporary tables, ensuring that the database engine processes only the necessary data for group computations.\n4. Efficiencies are gained by encouraging the use of indexed columns with `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT`, making queries more efficient by reducing the cost associated with sorting and filtering operations.\n"""\nRule 4:\n"""\n**Conditions**: The SQL query rewrite rule applies when there are:\n- Functions or operations (especially deterministic ones) within the SELECT, WHERE, JOIN conditions, or any part of the query that is executed multiple times for the same row.\n- The presence of potentially computationally expensive operations or function calls that are not dependent on the data of the specific row and thus can be optimized.\n**Transformations**: 1. Move repeated function calls or operations outside of loops, if applicable. For example, if a function that generates a calculated value based on constants or parameters (not row-specific data) is being called in a loop, calculate the value once before the loop and store the result for reuse.\n   \n2. Replace inline functions in the SELECT or WHERE clause with a pre-calculated column if the function is deterministic and the input data does not change frequently. This might involve:\n   - Creating a temporary table that includes the results of the expensive function calls.\n   - Using a subquery or a Common Table Expression (CTE) that calculates the value once and then joins it with the main query.\n   \n3. When using aggregate functions that are called multiple times with the same parameters, consider storing the result in a variable or a temporary table, especially if the data set is large.\n\n4. Avoid using functions on indexed columns in the WHERE clause. This prevents the database from using the index efficiently. If a function must be used, consider creating a computed column that pre-calculates the function\'s result and index that column instead.\n\n5. If possible, simplify expressions and calculations to reduce their complexity and execution time. This might involve algebraic simplification or breaking down complex calculations into simpler parts that can be calculated separately and then combined.\n\nExample:\nOriginal Query:\n```sql\nSELECT id, name, expensive_function(column) as expensive_result\nFROM table\nWHERE expensive_function(column) > 100;\n```\n\nTransformed Query using a CTE:\n```sql\nWITH PreCalculated AS (\n  SELECT id, name, column, expensive_function(column) as expensive_result\n  FROM table\n)\nSELECT id, name, expensive_sel as expensive_result\nFROM PreCalculated\nWHERE expensive_result > 100;\n```\n"""\nRule 5:\n"""\n**Conditions**: The rule applies when the original SQL query performs multiple scans or joins on the same table to retrieve different attributes for certain conditions, or when the query structure results in redundant data processing and complexity that could be reduced.\n**Transformations**: - Combine multiple joins into a single join operation by using `CASE` statements to conditionally select different attributes from the table in one pass. \n- Use the `COALESCE` function in conjunction with `CASE` statements to efficiently merge conditional attributes into distinct columns based on specific criteria without the need for additional joins.\n- Optimize the selection of conditional attributes by integrating `GROUP BY` with aggregate functions like `MAX` within `CASE` statements, thus condensing the result set to only the necessary data and avoiding needless retrieval and processing steps.\n- The overall transformation leads to a single, more efficient query that accomplishes the tasks of multiple, less efficient operations, improving performance, and simplifying the query for better readability and maintenance.\n"""'}], 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'stream': False, 'temperature': 0.1}}

The filter\'s expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there\'s a matching row in the non-preserving side\'s table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned.\n```\n\nLogical Plan Changes After Rewrite: ```\n  LogicalSort(sort0=[$0], sort1=[$1], dir0=[ASC], dir1=[ASC], fetch=[100])\r\n    LogicalAggregate(group=[{0, 1}], groups=[[{0, 1}, {0}, {}]], sales=[SUM($2)], returns=[SUM($3)], profit=[SUM($4)])\r\n      LogicalUnion(all=[true])\r\n        LogicalUnion(all=[true])\r\n          LogicalProject(channel=[\'store channel\'], id=[||(\'store\', $0(s_store_id))], sales=[$1(ss_ext_sales_price)], returns=[$2(sr_return_amt)], profit=[$3])\r\n            LogicalAggregate(group=[{0}], sales=[SUM($1)], returns=[SUM($2)], profit=[SUM($3)])\r\n              LogicalProject(store_id=[$72(s_store_id)], ss_ext_sales_price=[$15(ss_ext_sales_price)], $f2=[CASE(IS NOT NULL($34(sr_return_amt)), CAST($34(sr_return_amt)):DECIMAL(12, 2) NOT NULL, 0:DECIMAL(12, 2))], $f3=[-($22(ss_net_profit), CASE(IS NOT NULL($42(sr_net_loss)), CAST($42(sr_net_loss)):DECIMAL(12, 2) NOT NULL, 0:DECIMAL(12, 2)))])\r\n-               LogicalFilter(condition=[AND(=($0(ss_sold_date_sk), $43(d_date_sk)), >=($45(d_date), CAST(\'2000-06-06\'):DATE NOT NULL), <=($45(d_date), +(CAST(\'2000-06-06\'):DATE NOT NULL, 2592000000:INTERVAL DAY)), =($7(ss_store_sk), $71(s_store_sk)), =($2(ss_item_sk), $100(i_item_sk)), >($105(i_current_price), 50), =($8(ss_promo_sk), $122(p_promo_sk)), =(CAST($131(p_channel_email)):CHAR(1), \'Y\'), =(CAST($133(p_channel_tv)):CHAR(1), \'Y\'), =(CAST($134(p_channel_radio)):CHAR(1), \'Y\'), =(CAST($135(p_channel_press)):CHAR(1), \'N\'), =(CAST($136(p_channel_event)):CHAR(1), \'N\'), >=($11(ss_wholesale_cost), 85), <=($11(ss_wholesale_cost), 100), OR(=(CAST($112(i_category)):CHAR(5), \'Books\'), =(CAST($112(i_category)):CHAR(7), \'Jewelry\')))])\r\n+               LogicalJoin(condition=[=($8(ss_promo_sk), $122(p_promo_sk))], joinType=[inner])\r\n-                 LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n?

You should cite the detailed changes of the given SQL query to explain this query rewrite process concisely and detailedly.\n\nOutput in the following format:\nStep 1: <step 1 reasoning>\nStep 2: <step 2 reasoning>\nStep 3: <step 3 reasoning>\nStep 4: <step 4 reasoning>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': '\nSQL Query: ```sql\nwith ssr as\n (select  s_store_id as store_id,\n          sum(ss_ext_sales_price) as sales,\n          sum(coalesce(sr_return_amt, 0)) as "returns",\n          sum(ss_net_profit - coalesce(sr_net_loss, 0)) as profit\n  from store_sales left outer join store_returns on\n         (ss_item_sk = sr_item_sk and ss_ticket_number = sr_ticket_number),\n     date_dim,\n     store,\n     item,\n     promotion\n where ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk\n       and d_date between cast(\'2000-06-06\' as date)\n                  and cast(\'2000-06-06\' as date) + interval \'30\' day\n       and ss_store_sk = s_store_sk\n       and ss_item_sk = i_item_sk\n       and i_current_price > 50\n       and ss_promo_sk = p_promo_sk\n       and p_channel_email = \'Y\'\n       and p_channel_tv = \'Y\'\n       and p_channel_radio = \'Y\'\n       and p_channel_press = \'N\'\n       and p_channel_event = \'N\'\n       and ss_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 85 AND 100\n       and i_category IN (\'Books\', \'Jewelry\')\n group by s_store_id)\n ,\n csr as\n (select  cp_catalog_page_id as catalog_page_id,\n          sum(cs_ext_sales_price) as sales,\n          sum(coalesce(cr_return_amount, 0)) as "returns",\n          sum(cs_net_profit - coalesce(cr_net_loss, 0)) as profit\n  from catalog_sales left outer join catalog_returns on\n         (cs_item_sk = cr_item_sk and cs_order_number = cr_order_number),\n     date_dim,\n     catalog_page,\n     item,\n     promotion\n where cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk\n       and d_date between cast(\'2000-06-06\' as date)\n                  and cast(\'2000-06-06\' as date) + interval \'30\' day\n        and cs_catalog_page_sk = cp_catalog_page_sk\n       and cs_item_sk = i_item_sk\n       and i_current_price > 50\n       and cs_promo_sk = p_promo_sk\n       and p_channel_email = \'Y\'\n       and p_channel_tv = \'Y\'\n       and p_channel_radio = \'Y\'\n       and p_channel_press = \'N\'\n       and p_channel_event = \'N\'\n       and cs_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 85 AND 100\n       and i_category IN (\'Books\', \'Jewelry\')\ngroup by cp_catalog_page_id)\n ,\n wsr as\n (select  web_site_id,\n          sum(ws_ext_sales_price) as sales,\n          sum(coalesce(wr_return_amt, 0)) as "returns",\n          sum(ws_net_profit - coalesce(wr_net_loss, 0)) as profit\n  from web_sales left outer join web_returns on\n         (ws_item_sk = wr_item_sk and ws_order_number = wr_order_number),\n     date_dim,\n     web_site,\n     item,\n     promotion\n where ws_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk\n       and d_date between cast(\'2000-06-06\' as date)\n                  and cast(\'2000-06-06\' as date) + interval \'30\' day\n        and ws_web_site_sk = web_site_sk\n       and ws_item_sk = i_item_sk\n       and i_current_price > 50\n       and ws_promo_sk = p_promo_sk\n       and p_channel_email = \'Y\'\n       and p_channel_tv = \'Y\'\n       and p_channel_radio = \'Y\'\n       and p_channel_press = \'N\'\n       and p_channel_event = \'N\'\n       and ws_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 85 AND 100\n       and i_category IN (\'Books\', \'Jewelry\')\ngroup by web_site_id)\n  select  channel\n        , id\n        , sum(sales) as sales\n        , sum("returns") as "returns"\n        , sum(profit) as profit\n from\n (select \'store channel\' as channel\n        , \'store\' || store_id as id\n        , sales\n        , "returns"\n        , profit\n from   ssr\n union all\n select \'catalog channel\' as channel\n        , \'catalog_page\' || catalog_page_id as id\n        , sales\n        , "returns"\n        , profit\n from  csr\n union all\n select \'web channel\' as channel\n        , \'web_site\' || web_site_id as id\n        , sales\n        , "returns"\n        , profit\n from   wsr\n ) x\n group by rollup (channel, id)\n order by channel\n         ,id\n limit 100;\n```\n\nQuery Rewrite Rule: ```\nCase 1:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains conditions that can be statically determined as always true (e.g., constant expressions like `1=1` or tautologies based on the column data types and constraints), then these conditions don\'t affect the result set.\n**Transformations**: Remove such conditions from the WHERE clause. If this results in an empty WHERE clause, remove the WHERE clause entirely.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause simplifies to conditions that are always false or involve comparisons with NULL in a way that the outcome is always false or NULL (e.g., `column != column` or `1=0`), indicating no rows can satisfy the filter.\n**Transformations**: Replace the query with one that selects no rows. This could be represented in different ways based on the SQL dialect. One universal method might be selecting from a dual table with a false condition.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains complex conditions that can be simplified based on known constraints, constants, or through logical simplification (e.g., `column IS NOT NULL AND column IS NOT NULL` simplifies to `column IS NOT NULL`).\n**Transformations**: Simplify the conditions according to logical rules and known constraints. Remove redundancy and unnecessary complexity.\n```\n\nLogical Plan Changes After Rewrite: ```\n  LogicalSort(sort0=[$0], sort1=[$1], dir0=[ASC], dir1=[ASC], fetch=[100])\r\n

The filter\'s expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there\'s a matching row in the non-preserving side\'s table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned.\n```\n\nLogical Plan Changes After Rewrite: ```\n  LogicalSort(sort0=[$0], sort1=[$1], dir0=[ASC], dir1=[ASC], fetch=[100])\r\n    LogicalAggregate(group=[{0, 1}], groups=[[{0, 1}, {0}, {}]], sales=[SUM($2)], returns=[SUM($3)], profit=[SUM($4)])\r\n      LogicalUnion(all=[true])\r\n        LogicalUnion(all=[true])\r\n          LogicalProject(channel=[\'store channel\'], id=[||(\'store\', $0(s_store_id))], sales=[$1(ss_ext_sales_price)], returns=[$2(sr_return_amt)], profit=[$3])\r\n            LogicalAggregate(group=[{0}], sales=[SUM($1)], returns=[SUM($2)], profit=[SUM($3)])\r\n              LogicalProject(store_id=[$72(s_store_id)], ss_ext_sales_price=[$15(ss_ext_sales_price)], $f2=[CASE(IS NOT NULL($34(sr_return_amt)), CAST($34(sr_return_amt)):DECIMAL(12, 2) NOT NULL, 0:DECIMAL(12, 2))], $f3=[-($22(ss_net_profit), CASE(IS NOT NULL($42(sr_net_loss)), CAST($42(sr_net_loss)):DECIMAL(12, 2) NOT NULL, 0:DECIMAL(12, 2)))])\r\n-               LogicalFilter(condition=[AND(=($0(ss_sold_date_sk), $43(d_date_sk)), >=($45(d_date), CAST(\'2000-06-06\'):DATE NOT NULL), <=($45(d_date), +(CAST(\'2000-06-06\'):DATE NOT NULL, 2592000000:INTERVAL DAY)), =($7(ss_store_sk), $71(s_store_sk)), =($2(ss_item_sk), $100(i_item_sk)), >($105(i_current_price), 50), =($8(ss_promo_sk), $122(p_promo_sk)), =(CAST($131(p_channel_email)):CHAR(1), \'Y\'), =(CAST($133(p_channel_tv)):CHAR(1), \'Y\'), =(CAST($134(p_channel_radio)):CHAR(1), \'Y\'), =(CAST($135(p_channel_press)):CHAR(1), \'N\'), =(CAST($136(p_channel_event)):CHAR(1), \'N\'), >=($11(ss_wholesale_cost), 85), <=($11(ss_wholesale_cost), 100), OR(=(CAST($112(i_category)):CHAR(5), \'Books\'), =(CAST($112(i_category)):CHAR(7), \'Jewelry\')))])\r\n+               LogicalJoin(condition=[=($8(ss_promo_sk), $122(p_promo_sk))], joinType=[inner])\r\n-                 LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n?

Specifically, the conditions that were in the WHERE clause have been moved into the ON clause of INNER JOINs. This is evident from the transformation of `LogicalFilter` conditions into `LogicalJoin` conditions.\n\nStep 2: Parsing the logical plan changes, we see that the SQL query's WHERE clause conditions that only involve columns from one side of the join have been moved into the ON clause of INNER JOINs. For example, conditions like `ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk`, `ss_store_sk = s_store_sk`, `ss_item_sk = i_item_sk`, and `ss_promo_sk = p_promo_sk` have been moved into the ON clause of INNER JOINs. Similarly, conditions involving `cs_*` and `ws_*` columns have been moved into their respective INNER JOIN ON clauses.\n\nStep 3: The query rewrite rule contains multiple cases. In this scenario, the changes match Case 1 of the rewrite rule. This is because the conditions moved into the ON clause of INNER JOINs involve columns from only one side of the join, and these conditions can be logically applied to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n\nStep 4: The SQL query changes can be explained by Case 1 of the query rewrite rule. The original query had filter conditions in the WHERE clause that only referenced columns from one side of the join. These conditions were moved into the ON clause of INNER JOINs, transforming the query from using implicit joins with filters to explicit INNER JOINs with combined conditions. This transformation optimizes the query by reducing the dataset size before the join operation, thus improving performance. For example, the condition `ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk` was moved from the WHERE clause to the ON clause of an INNER JOIN between `store_sales` and `date_dim`, ensuring that only relevant rows are joined, which is more efficient. Similar transformations were applied to other parts of the query involving `catalog_sales` and `web_sales`.", 'time': 5.2375922203063965}

If this results in an empty WHERE clause, remove the WHERE clause entirely.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause simplifies to conditions that are always false or involve comparisons with NULL in a way that the outcome is always false or NULL (e.g., `column != column` or `1=0`), indicating no rows can satisfy the filter.\n**Transformations**: Replace the query with one that selects no rows. This could be represented in different ways based on the SQL dialect. One universal method might be selecting from a dual table with a false condition.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains complex conditions that can be simplified based on known constraints, constants, or through logical simplification (e.g., `column IS NOT NULL AND column IS NOT NULL` simplifies to `column IS NOT NULL`).\n**Transformations**: Simplify the conditions according to logical rules and known constraints. Remove redundancy and unnecessary complexity.\n```\n\nLogical Plan Changes After Rewrite: ```\n  LogicalSort(sort0=[$0], sort1=[$1], dir0=[ASC], dir1=[ASC], fetch=[100])\r\n

applied to the SQL query. Specifically, the changes involve the transformation of certain filter conditions within the `LogicalFilter` nodes of the logical plan. The original conditions involving date range checks and wholesale cost checks have been replaced with `SEARCH` expressions, which are more efficient representations for range queries.\n\nStep 2: Parsing the logical plan changes, we observe the following detailed changes in the SQL query:\n- The date range condition `d_date between cast('2000-06-06' as date) and cast('2000-06-06' as date) + interval '30' day` has been transformed into `SEARCH($d_date, Sarg[[2000-06-06..2000-07-06]])`. This change simplifies the date range condition into a single search argument (Sarg) that represents the same date range.\n- The wholesale cost condition `ss_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 85 AND 100` has been transformed into `SEARCH($ss_wholesale_cost, Sarg[[85..100]])`.

The SQL query performs a `GROUP BY` operation along with other operations like `JOIN`.\n- Query performance could be enhanced by reducing the size of intermediate datasets.\n- Suitable for queries involving large datasets or attributes from Entity-Attribute-Value (EAV) tables.\n- Applicable when reordering the sequence of operations can lead to performance improvements.\n**Transformations**: - Rearrange the query to perform `GROUP BY` operations at the earliest stage, ideally before executing operations like `JOIN`.\n- Utilize subqueries for pre-aggregation to reduce the dataset size early in the execution process.\n- Directly restructure the query to prioritize grouping operations to minimize the workload on subsequent operations like `JOIN`, thereby enhancing overall execution speed and efficiency.\n"""\nRule 3:\n"""\n**Conditions**: The SQL query optimization rules apply under the following conditions:\n1. When the `LIMIT` clause is used to fetch a specified number of rows.\n2. When `ORDER BY` is used in conjunction with `LIMIT` to sort and limit the number of rows retrieved, particularly when sorting can leverage an index.\n3. When `DISTINCT` is used along with `LIMIT` to quickly identify and return unique rows without scanning the full dataset.\n4. During the use of `GROUP BY`, where optimization might involve sorting or traversing indexes in order to efficiently compute group values without processing the entire dataset.\n5. When sorting a specific number of rows from a single table based on non-indexed columns, utilizing in-memory sorting (`filesort`) techniques.\n**Transformations**: The specific SQL transformations that emerge from applying these optimization rules are:\n1. Combining `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY` encourages the database engine to stop the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained, avoiding full table sorts.\n2. Using `LIMIT` with `DISTINCT` leads to an early termination of the search for unique rows as soon as the needed amount is gathered, reducing time and resources spent on scanning the entire dataset.\n3. In the context of `GROUP BY`, optimizations may include indexing strategies or modifications to the way sorting is handled, such as employing `filesort` mechanisms that do not require temporary tables, ensuring that the database engine processes only the necessary data for group computations.\n4. Efficiencies are gained by encouraging the use of indexed columns with `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT`, making queries more efficient by reducing the cost associated with sorting and filtering operations.\n"""\nRule 4:\n"""\n**Conditions**: The SQL query rewrite rule applies when there are:\n- Functions or operations (especially deterministic ones) within the SELECT, WHERE, JOIN conditions, or any part of the query that is executed multiple times for the same row.\n- The presence of potentially computationally expensive operations or function calls that are not dependent on the data of the specific row and thus can be optimized.\n**Transformations**: 1. Move repeated function calls or operations outside of loops, if applicable. For example, if a function that generates a calculated value based on constants or parameters (not row-specific data) is being called in a loop, calculate the value once before the loop and store the result for reuse.\n   \n2. Replace inline functions in the SELECT or WHERE clause with a pre-calculated column if the function is deterministic and the input data does not change frequently. This might involve:\n   - Creating a temporary table that includes the results of the expensive function calls.\n   - Using a subquery or a Common Table Expression (CTE) that calculates the value once and then joins it with the main query.\n   \n3. When using aggregate functions that are called multiple times with the same parameters, consider storing the result in a variable or a temporary table, especially if the data set is large.\n\n4. Avoid using functions on indexed columns in the WHERE clause. This prevents the database from using the index efficiently. If a function must be used, consider creating a computed column that pre-calculates the function\'s result and index that column instead.\n\n5. If possible, simplify expressions and calculations to reduce their complexity and execution time. This might involve algebraic simplification or breaking down complex calculations into simpler parts that can be calculated separately and then combined.\n\nExample:\nOriginal Query:\n```sql\nSELECT id, name, expensive_function(column) as expensive_result\nFROM table\nWHERE expensive_function(column) > 100;\n```\n\nTransformed Query using a CTE:\n```sql\nWITH PreCalculated AS (\n  SELECT id, name, column, expensive_function(column) as expensive_result\n  FROM table\n)\nSELECT id, name, expensive_sel as expensive_result\nFROM PreCalculated\nWHERE expensive_result > 100;\n```\n"""\nRule 5:\n"""\n**Conditions**: The rule applies when the original SQL query performs multiple scans or joins on the same table to retrieve different attributes for certain conditions, or when the query structure results in redundant data processing and complexity that could be reduced.\n**Transformations**: - Combine multiple joins into a single join operation by using `CASE` statements to conditionally select different attributes from the table in one pass. \n- Use the `COALESCE` function in conjunction with `CASE` statements to efficiently merge conditional attributes into distinct columns based on specific criteria without the need for additional joins.\n- Optimize the selection of conditional attributes by integrating `GROUP BY` with aggregate functions like `MAX` within `CASE` statements, thus condensing the result set to only the necessary data and avoiding needless retrieval and processing steps.\n- The overall transformation leads to a single, more efficient query that accomplishes the tasks of multiple, less efficient operations, improving performance, and simplifying the query for better readability and maintenance.\n"""'}], 'response': 'Step 1: Analyze the SQL query against each provided rewrite rule to determine applicability.\n\n- **Rule 1**: This rule focuses on optimizing queries using traditional filtering mechanisms like `IN`, `EXISTS`, `OR`, etc. The given SQL query does not use these mechanisms in a way that matches the conditions specified in Rule 1.

Query 1: The SQL query changes can be explained by Case 1 of the query rewrite rule. The original query had filter conditions in the WHERE clause that only referenced columns from one side of the join. These conditions were moved into the ON clause of INNER JOINs, transforming the query from using implicit joins with filters to explicit INNER JOINs with combined conditions. This transformation optimizes the query by reducing the dataset size before the join operation, thus improving performance. For example, the condition `ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk` was moved from the WHERE clause to the ON clause of an INNER JOIN between `store_sales` and `date_dim`, ensuring that only relevant rows are joined, which is more efficient. Similar transformations were applied to other parts of the query involving `catalog_sales` and `web_sales`.
Query 2: The SQL query changes can be explained by the application of Case 3 of the query rewrite rule. The original conditions in the WHERE clause, specifically the date range and wholesale cost conditions, were complex and could be simplified.

Query Rewrite 1:
"""The SQL query changes can be explained by Case 1 of the query rewrite rule. The original query had filter conditions in the WHERE clause that only referenced columns from one side of the join. These conditions were moved into the ON clause of INNER JOINs, transforming the query from using implicit joins with filters to explicit INNER JOINs with combined conditions. This transformation optimizes the query by reducing the dataset size before the join operation, thus improving performance. For example, the condition `ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk` was moved from the WHERE clause to the ON clause of an INNER JOIN between `store_sales` and `date_dim`, ensuring that only relevant rows are joined, which is more efficient. Similar transformations were applied to other parts of the query involving `catalog_sales` and `web_sales`."""

Query Rewrite 2:
"""The SQL query changes can be explained by the application of Case 3 of the query rewrite rule. The original conditions in the WHERE clause, specifically the date range and wholesale cost conditions, were complex and could be simplified. By transforming these conditions into `SEARCH` expressions, the query becomes more efficient. The `SEARCH` expressions represent the same logical constraints but in a more optimized form, reducing redundancy and unnecessary complexity in the query. This transformation does not alter the result set but improves the query's execution efficiency by leveraging more efficient range representations."""

Query Rewrite 3:
"""The SQL query performs `GROUP BY` operations after joining multiple tables. According to Rule 2, we can optimize the query by performing `GROUP BY` operations earlier to reduce the size of intermediate datasets. This involves restructuring the query to prioritize grouping operations before joining with other tables.

For each of the CTEs (`ssr`, `csr`, `wsr`), we can attempt to perform the `GROUP BY` operation before joining with the `date_dim`, `store`, `item`, and `promotion` tables. This means we should first aggregate the sales, returns, and profit data from the `store_sales`, `catalog_sales`, and `web_sales` tables, respectively, and then join the aggregated results with the other tables.

This transformation can lead to a more efficient execution plan by reducing the amount of data processed in subsequent joins, thus enhancing overall query performance."""

Query Rewrite 4:
"""The SQL query uses `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY` and `GROUP BY`, which matches the conditions of Rule 3. The transformation involves ensuring that the database engine efficiently handles the sorting and limiting operations.

By combining `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY`, the database can stop the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained, avoiding full table sorts. Additionally, the use of `GROUP BY` can be optimized by ensuring that any sorting or indexing strategies are employed to minimize the workload on the database engine.

This transformation encourages the use of indexed columns with `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT`, making the query more efficient by reducing the cost associated with sorting and filtering operations."""

This transformation optimizes the query by reducing the dataset size before the join operation, thus improving performance. For example, the condition `ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk` was moved from the WHERE clause to the ON clause of an INNER JOIN between `store_sales` and `date_dim`, ensuring that only relevant rows are joined, which is more efficient.

This means we should first aggregate the sales, returns, and profit data from the `store_sales`, `catalog_sales`, and `web_sales` tables, respectively, and then join the aggregated results with the other tables.\n\nThis transformation can lead to a more efficient execution plan by reducing the amount of data processed in subsequent joins, thus enhancing overall query performance."""\n\nQuery Rewrite 4:\n"""The SQL query uses `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY` and `GROUP BY`, which matches the conditions of Rule 3.

The original query had filter conditions in the WHERE clause that only referenced columns from one side of the join. These conditions were moved into the ON clause of INNER JOINs, transforming the query from using implicit joins with filters to explicit INNER JOINs with combined conditions. This transformation optimizes the query by reducing the dataset size before the join operation, thus improving performance. For example, the condition `ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk` was moved from the WHERE clause to the ON clause of an INNER JOIN between `store_sales` and `date_dim`, ensuring that only relevant rows are joined, which is more efficient. Similar transformations were applied to other parts of the query involving `catalog_sales` and `web_sales`."""\n\nQuery Rewrite 2:\n"""The SQL query changes can be explained by the application of Case 3 of the query rewrite rule. The original conditions in the WHERE clause, specifically the date range and wholesale cost conditions, were complex and could be simplified. By transforming these conditions into `SEARCH` expressions, the query becomes more efficient. The `SEARCH` expressions represent the same logical constraints but in a more optimized form, reducing redundancy and unnecessary complexity in the query. This transformation does not alter the result set but improves the query\'s execution efficiency by leveraging more efficient range representations."""\n\nQuery Rewrite 3:\n"""The SQL query performs `GROUP BY` operations after joining multiple tables. According to Rule 2, we can optimize the query by performing `GROUP BY` operations earlier to reduce the size of intermediate datasets. This involves restructuring the query to prioritize grouping operations before joining with other tables.\n\nFor each of the CTEs (`ssr`, `csr`, `wsr`), we can attempt to perform the `GROUP BY` operation before joining with the `date_dim`, `store`, `item`, and `promotion` tables. This means we should first aggregate the sales, returns, and profit data from the `store_sales`, `catalog_sales`, and `web_sales` tables, respectively, and then join the aggregated results with the other tables.\n\nThis transformation can lead to a more efficient execution plan by reducing the amount of data processed in subsequent joins, thus enhancing overall query performance."""\n\nQuery Rewrite 4:\n"""The SQL query uses `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY` and `GROUP BY`, which matches the conditions of Rule 3. The transformation involves ensuring that the database engine efficiently handles the sorting and limiting operations.\n\nBy combining `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY`, the database can stop the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained, avoiding full table sorts. Additionally, the use of `GROUP BY` can be optimized by ensuring that any sorting or indexing strategies are employed to minimize the workload on the database engine.\n\nThis transformation encourages the use of indexed columns with `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT`, making the query more efficient by reducing the cost associated with sorting and filtering operations."""'}], 'response': "To cluster the provided query rewrite strategies, we need to identify common themes or techniques used in the rewrites.

The original query had filter conditions in the WHERE clause that only referenced columns from one side of the join. These conditions were moved into the ON clause of INNER JOINs, transforming the query from using implicit joins with filters to explicit INNER JOINs with combined conditions. This transformation optimizes the query by reducing the dataset size before the join operation, thus improving performance. For example, the condition `ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk` was moved from the WHERE clause to the ON clause of an INNER JOIN between `store_sales` and `date_dim`, ensuring that only relevant rows are joined, which is more efficient. Similar transformations were applied to other parts of the query involving `catalog_sales` and `web_sales`."""\n\nQuery Rewrite 2:\n"""The SQL query changes can be explained by the application of Case 3 of the query rewrite rule. The original conditions in the WHERE clause, specifically the date range and wholesale cost conditions, were complex and could be simplified. By transforming these conditions into `SEARCH` expressions, the query becomes more efficient. The `SEARCH` expressions represent the same logical constraints but in a more optimized form, reducing redundancy and unnecessary complexity in the query. This transformation does not alter the result set but improves the query\'s execution efficiency by leveraging more efficient range representations."""\n\nQuery Rewrite 3:\n"""The SQL query performs `GROUP BY` operations after joining multiple tables. According to Rule 2, we can optimize the query by performing `GROUP BY` operations earlier to reduce the size of intermediate datasets. This involves restructuring the query to prioritize grouping operations before joining with other tables.\n\nFor each of the CTEs (`ssr`, `csr`, `wsr`), we can attempt to perform the `GROUP BY` operation before joining with the `date_dim`, `store`, `item`, and `promotion` tables. This means we should first aggregate the sales, returns, and profit data from the `store_sales`, `catalog_sales`, and `web_sales` tables, respectively, and then join the aggregated results with the other tables.\n\nThis transformation can lead to a more efficient execution plan by reducing the amount of data processed in subsequent joins, thus enhancing overall query performance."""\n\nQuery Rewrite 4:\n"""The SQL query uses `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY` and `GROUP BY`, which matches the conditions of Rule 3. The transformation involves ensuring that the database engine efficiently handles the sorting and limiting operations.\n\nBy combining `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY`, the database can stop the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained, avoiding full table sorts. Additionally, the use of `GROUP BY` can be optimized by ensuring that any sorting or indexing strategies are employed to minimize the workload on the database engine.\n\nThis transformation encourages the use of indexed columns with `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT`, making the query more efficient by reducing the cost associated with sorting and filtering operations."""'}], 'response': 'The provided SQL query can be optimized using several rewrite strategies.

The filter's expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there's a matching row in the non-preserving side's table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned."}, {'name': 'FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS', 'rewrite': "Case 1:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains conditions that can be statically determined as always true (e.g., constant expressions like `1=1` or tautologies based on the column data types and constraints), then these conditions don't affect the result set.\n**Transformations**: Remove such conditions from the WHERE clause. If this results in an empty WHERE clause, remove the WHERE clause entirely.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause simplifies to conditions that are always false or involve comparisons with NULL in a way that the outcome is always false or NULL (e.g., `column != column` or `1=0`), indicating no rows can satisfy the filter.\n**Transformations**: Replace the query with one that selects no rows. This could be represented in different ways based on the SQL dialect. One universal method might be selecting from a dual table with a false condition.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains complex conditions that can be simplified based on known constraints, constants, or through logical simplification (e.g., `column IS NOT NULL AND column IS NOT NULL` simplifies to `column IS NOT NULL`).\n**Transformations**: Simplify the conditions according to logical rules and known constraints.

This often involves changing `COUNT()` to `SUM()` around an indicator for non-null rows if `COUNT()` is used. \n3. **Applying Transformation:** \n- Identify each select query (or subquery) involved in the `UNION ALL` operation. \n- Apply an aggregate operation similar to the original operation directly within each of these subqueries. This might involve wrapping each subquery in an additional `SELECT` statement that performs the aggregations. \n- Use `UNION ALL` to combine these newly aggregated subqueries. \n- Apply a final aggregate operation on top of the combined results.

Firstly, by applying Case 1, filter conditions originally in the WHERE clause that only referenced columns from one side of the join were moved to the ON clause of INNER JOINs. This change reduces the dataset size before the join operation, enhancing performance by ensuring only relevant rows are joined. Secondly, Case 3 was applied to simplify complex conditions in the WHERE clause, such as date range and wholesale cost conditions, by transforming them into more efficient `SEARCH` expressions, which maintain logical constraints while improving execution efficiency. Thirdly, according to Rule 2, the query can be optimized by performing `GROUP BY` operations earlier in the process, specifically within each CTE, before joining with other tables. This restructuring reduces the size of intermediate datasets, leading to a more efficient execution plan. Lastly, Rule 3 suggests optimizing the use of `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY` and `GROUP BY` by ensuring efficient handling of sorting and limiting operations. This involves leveraging indexed columns to minimize sorting and filtering costs, thus enhancing overall query performance."""\n\nQuery Rewrite Rules:\n### Rule FILTER_INTO_JOIN:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: This SQL query rewrite rule applies when a filter condition is placed on the result set of an INNER JOIN operation. The filter\'s expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there\'s a matching row in the non-preserving side\'s table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned."""\n\n### Rule FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains conditions that can be statically determined as always true (e.g., constant expressions like `1=1` or tautologies based on the column data types and constraints), then these conditions don\'t affect the result set.\n**Transformations**: Remove such conditions from the WHERE clause. If this results in an empty WHERE clause, remove the WHERE clause entirely.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause simplifies to conditions that are always false or involve comparisons with NULL in a way that the outcome is always false or NULL (e.g., `column != column` or `1=0`), indicating no rows can satisfy the filter.\n**Transformations**: Replace the query with one that selects no rows. This could be represented in different ways based on the SQL dialect. One universal method might be selecting from a dual table with a false condition.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains complex conditions that can be simplified based on known constraints, constants, or through logical simplification (e.g., `column IS NOT NULL AND column IS NOT NULL` simplifies to `column IS NOT NULL`).\n**Transformations**: Simplify the conditions according to logical rules and known constraints. Remove redundancy and unnecessary complexity."""\n\n### Rule PROJECT_FILTER_TRANSPOSE:\n"""**Conditions**: This rewrite rule can be applied when an SQL query contains a SELECT operation (acting as the `Project` operation) followed by a WHERE clause (acting as the `Filter` operation), provided that the SELECT does not contain window functions (such as RANK(), ROW_NUMBER(), etc.) and the columns selected do not affect the outcome of the WHERE clause.\n**Transformations**: To apply the rule, refactor the SQL query so that the conditions in the WHERE clause are evaluated before the columns are selected in the SELECT clause. This may involve moving computations or column transformations from the SELECT clause to a sub-query that the WHERE clause is applied on, ensuring the final SELECT clause on the outermost query matches the original query\'s expected outcome. - Before: SELECT col1, transformation_function(col2) FROM table WHERE condition; - After: SELECT col1, transformation_function(col2) FROM (SELECT col1, col2 FROM table WHERE condition) AS subquery;"""\n\n### Rule AGGREGATE_REDUCE_FUNCTIONS:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: any SELECT statement or subquery using the AVG aggregate function\n**Transformations**: AVG(x) as SUM(x) / COUNT(x)\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: computing the population standard deviation\n**Transformations**: STDDEV_POP(x) as the square root of (`SUM(x^2) - SUM(x)^2 / COUNT(x)`) / COUNT(x)\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: for the sample standard deviation computation\n**Transformations**: STDDEV_SAMP(x) as the square root of (`SUM(x^2) - SUM(x)^2 / COUNT(x)`) / (COUNT(x) - 1)\nCase 4:\n**Conditions**: for the population variance computation\n**Transformations**: VAR_POP(x) as (`SUM(x^2) - SUM(x)^2 / COUNT(x)`) / COUNT(x)\nCase 5:\n**Conditions**: for the sample variance computation\n**Transformations**: VAR_SAMP(x) as (`SUM(x^2) - SUM(x)^2 / COUNT(x)`) / (COUNT(x) - 1)\nCase 6:\n**Conditions**: to compute population covariance\n**Transformations**: COVAR_POP(x, y) by applying a formula involving SUM and COUNT\nCase 7:\n**Conditions**: using a formula for sample covariance\n**Transformations**: COVAR_SAMP(x, y) using a formula involving SUM, COUNT, and an adjustment for sample calculations\nCase 8:\n**Conditions**: for transforming REGR_SXX(x, y) and REGR_SYY(x, y)\n**Transformations**: into expressions involving the computation of VAR_POP(x) or VAR_POP(y) respectively, multiplied by REGR_COUNT(x, y)"""\n\n### Rule JOIN_TO_CORRELATE:\n"""**Conditions**: The join type is either INNER JOIN or LEFT JOIN. There are no requirements in the query that would inherently create NULL values on the left side when there are no matching rows on the right side (for INNER JOIN, this condition is naturally met; for LEFT JOIN, it is met if every row on the left side has at least one corresponding row on the right side according to the join condition).\n**Transformations**: 1. Identify the INNER JOIN or LEFT JOIN condition in the SQL query. 2. Extract the ON clause representing the join condition. 3. For INNER JOIN: - Replace the INNER JOIN with a WHERE EXISTS clause, moving the original join condition into the WHERE clause of a subquery that selects from the right side table. Reference the left side columns as correlation variables in the subquery\'s WHERE clause. - Example Transformation: SELECT * FROM left_table INNER JOIN right_table ON left_table.id = right_table.foreign_id Becomes: SELECT * FROM left_table WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM right_table WHERE left_table.id = right_table.foreign_id) 4. For LEFT JOIN: - Replace the LEFT JOIN with a LEFT OUTER JOIN subquery that is correlated to the outer query. In the SELECT clause of the outer query, include a CASE statement or similar logic to handle selection from the subquery result. - Example Transformation: SELECT left_table.*, right_table.* FROM left_table LEFT JOIN right_table ON left_table.id = right_table.foreign_id Becomes: SELECT left_table.*, COALESCE(subquery.alias1, \'default\') FROM left_table LEFT OUTER JOIN (SELECT foreign_id, column1 AS alias1 FROM right_table) subquery ON left_table.id = subquery.foreign_id"""\n\n### Rule AGGREGATE_UNION_TRANSPOSE:\n"""**Conditions**: 1. The SQL query contains an aggregate function (e.g., `SUM()`, `COUNT()`) applied after a `UNION ALL` operation. \n2. The `UNION ALL` operation does not inherently ensure uniqueness across its inputs that would affect the correctness of aggregate functions if they were pushed down (validation of this condition might require schema or data analysis beyond simple SQL transformation logic).\n**Transformations**: 1. **Validation:** Ensure the SQL query involves a `UNION ALL` directly followed by an aggregate operation, and that pushing down the aggregate will not change the semantics of the query incorrectly (e.g., aggregating over unique rows that become non-unique after the `UNION ALL`). \n2. **Transforming Aggregate Functions:** For aggregate functions like `COUNT()`, modify them to ensure their correctness when applied after `UNION ALL`. This often involves changing `COUNT()` to `SUM()` around an indicator for non-null rows if `COUNT()` is used. \n3. **Applying Transformation:** \n- Identify each select query (or subquery) involved in the `UNION ALL` operation. \n- Apply an aggregate operation similar to the original operation directly within each of these subqueries. This might involve wrapping each subquery in an additional `SELECT` statement that performs the aggregations. \n- Use `UNION ALL` to combine these newly aggregated subqueries. \n- Apply a final aggregate operation on top of the combined results. This operation should ensure overall query semantics remain unchanged, particularly regarding group by keys, which might require adjustments to match the aggregated data\'s new structure. \n\n- **Example Transformation:** For a query that originally looks like: \n```sql \nSELECT COUNT(*) FROM ( \n  SELECT column1 FROM table1 \n  UNION ALL \n  SELECT column1 FROM table2 \n) subquery \n``` \nTransform it into: \n```sql \nSELECT SUM(subquery_count) FROM ( \n  SELECT COUNT(*) as subquery_count FROM table1 \n  UNION ALL \n  SELECT COUNT(*) as subquery_count FROM table2 \n) subquery \n``` \nThis corrects the usage of `COUNT()` by switching to a `SUM()` of counts from each part of the union, assuming `COUNT()` semantics are desired across the `UNION ALL`."""'}], 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'stream': False, 'temperature': 0.1}}

Firstly, by applying Case 1, filter conditions originally in the WHERE clause that only referenced columns from one side of the join were moved to the ON clause of INNER JOINs. This change reduces the dataset size before the join operation, enhancing performance by ensuring only relevant rows are joined. Secondly, Case 3 was applied to simplify complex conditions in the WHERE clause, such as date range and wholesale cost conditions, by transforming them into more efficient `SEARCH` expressions, which maintain logical constraints while improving execution efficiency. Thirdly, according to Rule 2, the query can be optimized by performing `GROUP BY` operations earlier in the process, specifically within each CTE, before joining with other tables. This restructuring reduces the size of intermediate datasets, leading to a more efficient execution plan. Lastly, Rule 3 suggests optimizing the use of `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY` and `GROUP BY` by ensuring efficient handling of sorting and limiting operations. This involves leveraging indexed columns to minimize sorting and filtering costs, thus enhancing overall query performance."""\n\nQuery Rewrite Rules:\n### Rule FILTER_INTO_JOIN:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: This SQL query rewrite rule applies when a filter condition is placed on the result set of an INNER JOIN operation. The filter\'s expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there\'s a matching row in the non-preserving side\'s table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned."""\n\n### Rule FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains conditions that can be statically determined as always true (e.g., constant expressions like `1=1` or tautologies based on the column data types and constraints), then these conditions don\'t affect the result set.\n**Transformations**: Remove such conditions from the WHERE clause. If this results in an empty WHERE clause, remove the WHERE clause entirely.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause simplifies to conditions that are always false or involve comparisons with NULL in a way that the outcome is always false or NULL (e.g., `column != column` or `1=0`), indicating no rows can satisfy the filter.\n**Transformations**: Replace the query with one that selects no rows. This could be represented in different ways based on the SQL dialect. One universal method might be selecting from a dual table with a false condition.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains complex conditions that can be simplified based on known constraints, constants, or through logical simplification (e.g., `column IS NOT NULL AND column IS NOT NULL` simplifies to `column IS NOT NULL`).\n**Transformations**: Simplify the conditions according to logical rules and known constraints. Remove redundancy and unnecessary complexity."""\n\n### Rule PROJECT_FILTER_TRANSPOSE:\n"""**Conditions**: This rewrite rule can be applied when an SQL query contains a SELECT operation (acting as the `Project` operation) followed by a WHERE clause (acting as the `Filter` operation), provided that the SELECT does not contain window functions (such as RANK(), ROW_NUMBER(), etc.) and the columns selected do not affect the outcome of the WHERE clause.\n**Transformations**: To apply the rule, refactor the SQL query so that the conditions in the WHERE clause are evaluated before the columns are selected in the SELECT clause. This may involve moving computations or column transformations from the SELECT clause to a sub-query that the WHERE clause is applied on, ensuring the final SELECT clause on the outermost query matches the original query\'s expected outcome. - Before: SELECT col1, transformation_function(col2) FROM table WHERE condition; - After: SELECT col1, transformation_function(col2) FROM (SELECT col1, col2 FROM table WHERE condition) AS subquery;"""\n\n### Rule AGGREGATE_REDUCE_FUNCTIONS:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: any SELECT statement or subquery using the AVG aggregate function\n**Transformations**: AVG(x) as SUM(x) / COUNT(x)\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: computing the population standard deviation\n**Transformations**: STDDEV_POP(x) as the square root of (`SUM(x^2) - SUM(x)^2 / COUNT(x)`) / COUNT(x)\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: for the sample standard deviation computation\n**Transformations**: STDDEV_SAMP(x) as the square root of (`SUM(x^2) - SUM(x)^2 / COUNT(x)`) / (COUNT(x) - 1)\nCase 4:\n**Conditions**: for the population variance computation\n**Transformations**: VAR_POP(x) as (`SUM(x^2) - SUM(x)^2 / COUNT(x)`) / COUNT(x)\nCase 5:\n**Conditions**: for the sample variance computation\n**Transformations**: VAR_SAMP(x) as (`SUM(x^2) - SUM(x)^2 / COUNT(x)`) / (COUNT(x) - 1)\nCase 6:\n**Conditions**: to compute population covariance\n**Transformations**: COVAR_POP(x, y) by applying a formula involving SUM and COUNT\nCase 7:\n**Conditions**: using a formula for sample covariance\n**Transformations**: COVAR_SAMP(x, y) using a formula involving SUM, COUNT, and an adjustment for sample calculations\nCase 8:\n**Conditions**: for transforming REGR_SXX(x, y) and REGR_SYY(x, y)\n**Transformations**: into expressions involving the computation of VAR_POP(x) or VAR_POP(y) respectively, multiplied by REGR_COUNT(x, y)"""\n\n### Rule JOIN_TO_CORRELATE:\n"""**Conditions**: The join type is either INNER JOIN or LEFT JOIN. There are no requirements in the query that would inherently create NULL values on the left side when there are no matching rows on the right side (for INNER JOIN, this condition is naturally met; for LEFT JOIN, it is met if every row on the left side has at least one corresponding row on the right side according to the join condition).\n**Transformations**: 1. Identify the INNER JOIN or LEFT JOIN condition in the SQL query. 2. Extract the ON clause representing the join condition. 3. For INNER JOIN: - Replace the INNER JOIN with a WHERE EXISTS clause, moving the original join condition into the WHERE clause of a subquery that selects from the right side table. Reference the left side columns as correlation variables in the subquery\'s WHERE clause. - Example Transformation: SELECT * FROM left_table INNER JOIN right_table ON left_table.id = right_table.foreign_id Becomes: SELECT * FROM left_table WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM right_table WHERE left_table.id = right_table.foreign_id) 4. For LEFT JOIN: - Replace the LEFT JOIN with a LEFT OUTER JOIN subquery that is correlated to the outer query. In the SELECT clause of the outer query, include a CASE statement or similar logic to handle selection from the subquery result. - Example Transformation: SELECT left_table.*, right_table.* FROM left_table LEFT JOIN right_table ON left_table.id = right_table.foreign_id Becomes: SELECT left_table.*, COALESCE(subquery.alias1, \'default\') FROM left_table LEFT OUTER JOIN (SELECT foreign_id, column1 AS alias1 FROM right_table) subquery ON left_table.id = subquery.foreign_id"""\n\n### Rule AGGREGATE_UNION_TRANSPOSE:\n"""**Conditions**: 1. The SQL query contains an aggregate function (e.g., `SUM()`, `COUNT()`) applied after a `UNION ALL` operation. \n2. The `UNION ALL` operation does not inherently ensure uniqueness across its inputs that would affect the correctness of aggregate functions if they were pushed down (validation of this condition might require schema or data analysis beyond simple SQL transformation logic).\n**Transformations**: 1. **Validation:** Ensure the SQL query involves a `UNION ALL` directly followed by an aggregate operation, and that pushing down the aggregate will not change the semantics of the query incorrectly (e.g., aggregating over unique rows that become non-unique after the `UNION ALL`). \n2. **Transforming Aggregate Functions:** For aggregate functions like `COUNT()`, modify them to ensure their correctness when applied after `UNION ALL`. This often involves changing `COUNT()` to `SUM()` around an indicator for non-null rows if `COUNT()` is used. \n3. **Applying Transformation:** \n- Identify each select query (or subquery) involved in the `UNION ALL` operation. \n- Apply an aggregate operation similar to the original operation directly within each of these subqueries. This might involve wrapping each subquery in an additional `SELECT` statement that performs the aggregations. \n- Use `UNION ALL` to combine these newly aggregated subqueries. \n- Apply a final aggregate operation on top of the combined results. This operation should ensure overall query semantics remain unchanged, particularly regarding group by keys, which might require adjustments to match the aggregated data\'s new structure. \n\n- **Example Transformation:** For a query that originally looks like: \n```sql \nSELECT COUNT(*) FROM ( \n  SELECT column1 FROM table1 \n  UNION ALL \n  SELECT column1 FROM table2 \n) subquery \n``` \nTransform it into: \n```sql \nSELECT SUM(subquery_count) FROM ( \n  SELECT COUNT(*) as subquery_count FROM table1 \n  UNION ALL \n  SELECT COUNT(*) as subquery_count FROM table2 \n) subquery \n``` \nThis corrects the usage of `COUNT()` by switching to a `SUM()` of counts from each part of the union, assuming `COUNT()` semantics are desired across the `UNION ALL`."""'}], 'response': 'Step 1: Evaluate each suggestion against the provided query rewrite rules.\n\n### Suggestion 1:\n1. **Move filter conditions to ON clause of INNER JOINs**: \n   - **Rule FILTER_INTO_JOIN**: This rule applies to INNER JOINs and suggests moving filter conditions from the WHERE clause to the ON clause if they only reference columns from one side of the join.

Firstly, by applying Case 1, filter conditions originally in the WHERE clause that only referenced columns from one side of the join were moved to the ON clause of INNER JOINs. This change reduces the dataset size before the join operation, enhancing performance by ensuring only relevant rows are joined. Secondly, Case 3 was applied to simplify complex conditions in the WHERE clause, such as date range and wholesale cost conditions, by transforming them into more efficient `SEARCH` expressions, which maintain logical constraints while improving execution efficiency. Thirdly, according to Rule 2, the query can be optimized by performing `GROUP BY` operations earlier in the process, specifically within each CTE, before joining with other tables. This restructuring reduces the size of intermediate datasets, leading to a more efficient execution plan. Lastly, Rule 3 suggests optimizing the use of `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY` and `GROUP BY` by ensuring efficient handling of sorting and limiting operations. This involves leveraging indexed columns to minimize sorting and filtering costs, thus enhancing overall query performance."""\n\nQuery Rewrite Rules:\n### Rule FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains conditions that can be statically determined as always true (e.g., constant expressions like `1=1` or tautologies based on the column data types and constraints), then these conditions don\'t affect the result set.\n**Transformations**: Remove such conditions from the WHERE clause. If this results in an empty WHERE clause, remove the WHERE clause entirely.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause simplifies to conditions that are always false or involve comparisons with NULL in a way that the outcome is always false or NULL (e.g., `column != column` or `1=0`), indicating no rows can satisfy the filter.\n**Transformations**: Replace the query with one that selects no rows. This could be represented in different ways based on the SQL dialect. One universal method might be selecting from a dual table with a false condition.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains complex conditions that can be simplified based on known constraints, constants, or through logical simplification (e.g., `column IS NOT NULL AND column IS NOT NULL` simplifies to `column IS NOT NULL`).\n**Transformations**: Simplify the conditions according to logical rules and known constraints. Remove redundancy and unnecessary complexity."""\n\nRule Subset Sequences:\n### Rule Sequence 1: []'}], 'response': 'To optimize the given SQL query, we need to apply the suggested rewrite strategies and rules in an effective sequence. The suggestions provided include moving filter conditions to the ON clause of INNER JOINs, simplifying complex conditions, performing GROUP BY operations earlier, and optimizing the use of LIMIT with ORDER BY and GROUP BY.\n\nLet\'s break down the suggestions and rules:\n\n1. **FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS (Case 1 and Case 3)**: This rule involves simplifying the WHERE clause by moving conditions to the ON clause of INNER JOINs and simplifying complex conditions. This should be applied first to reduce the dataset size before any joins or further operations.\n\n2. **GROUP_BY_EARLY**: This rule suggests performing GROUP BY operations earlier within each CTE. This should be applied after simplifying the WHERE clause to ensure that the dataset is reduced before aggregation, which can lead to more efficient execution.\n\n3. **LIMIT_ORDER_BY_OPTIMIZATION**: This rule involves optimizing the use of LIMIT with ORDER BY and GROUP BY. This should be applied last, as it deals with the final output of the query, ensuring efficient handling of sorting and limiting operations.\n\nGiven these considerations, the sequence of applying the rules should be as follows:\n\n- Start with `FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS` to simplify and reduce the dataset early.\n- Apply `GROUP_BY_EARLY` to perform aggregations on a reduced dataset.\n- Finally, apply `LIMIT_ORDER_BY_OPTIMIZATION` to optimize the final output operations.\n\nSince the Rule Subset Sequences provided are empty, we don\'t have any specific order constraints within subsets, allowing us to focus on the logical order of operations.\n\nHere\'s the organized sequence of rules:\n\n```python\n["FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS", "GROUP_BY_EARLY", "LIMIT_ORDER_BY_OPTIMIZATION"]\n```', 'time': 5.432167291641235}
