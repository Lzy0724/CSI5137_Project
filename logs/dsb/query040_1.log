When the `LIMIT` clause is used to fetch a specified number of rows.\n2. When `ORDER BY` is used in conjunction with `LIMIT` to sort and limit the number of rows retrieved, particularly when sorting can leverage an index.\n3. When `DISTINCT` is used along with `LIMIT` to quickly identify and return unique rows without scanning the full dataset.\n4. During the use of `GROUP BY`, where optimization might involve sorting or traversing indexes in order to efficiently compute group values without processing the entire dataset.\n5. When sorting a specific number of rows from a single table based on non-indexed columns, utilizing in-memory sorting (`filesort`) techniques.\n**Transformations**: The specific SQL transformations that emerge from applying these optimization rules are:\n1. Combining `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY` encourages the database engine to stop the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained, avoiding full table sorts.\n2. Using `LIMIT` with `DISTINCT` leads to an early termination of the search for unique rows as soon as the needed amount is gathered, reducing time and resources spent on scanning the entire dataset.\n3. In the context of `GROUP BY`, optimizations may include indexing strategies or modifications to the way sorting is handled, such as employing `filesort` mechanisms that do not require temporary tables, ensuring that the database engine processes only the necessary data for group computations.\n4. Efficiencies are gained by encouraging the use of indexed columns with `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT`, making queries more efficient by reducing the cost associated with sorting and filtering operations.\n"""\nRule 3:\n"""\n**Conditions**: The SQL query rewrite rule applies when there are:\n- Functions or operations (especially deterministic ones) within the SELECT, WHERE, JOIN conditions, or any part of the query that is executed multiple times for the same row.\n- The presence of potentially computationally expensive operations or function calls that are not dependent on the data of the specific row and thus can be optimized.\n**Transformations**: 1. Move repeated function calls or operations outside of loops, if applicable. For example, if a function that generates a calculated value based on constants or parameters (not row-specific data) is being called in a loop, calculate the value once before the loop and store the result for reuse.\n   \n2. Replace inline functions in the SELECT or WHERE clause with a pre-calculated column if the function is deterministic and the input data does not change frequently. This might involve:\n   - Creating a temporary table that includes the results of the expensive function calls.\n   - Using a subquery or a Common Table Expression (CTE) that calculates the value once and then joins it with the main query.\n   \n3. When using aggregate functions that are called multiple times with the same parameters, consider storing the result in a variable or a temporary table, especially if the data set is large.\n\n4. Avoid using functions on indexed columns in the WHERE clause. This prevents the database from using the index efficiently. If a function must be used, consider creating a computed column that pre-calculates the function\'s result and index that column instead.\n\n5. If possible, simplify expressions and calculations to reduce their complexity and execution time. This might involve algebraic simplification or breaking down complex calculations into simpler parts that can be calculated separately and then combined.\n\nExample:\nOriginal Query:\n```sql\nSELECT id, name, expensive_function(column) as expensive_result\nFROM table\nWHERE expensive_function(column) > 100;\n```\n\nTransformed Query using a CTE:\n```sql\nWITH PreCalculated AS (\n  SELECT id, name, column, expensive_function(column) as expensive_result\n  FROM table\n)\nSELECT id, name, expensive_sel as expensive_result\nFROM PreCalculated\nWHERE expensive_result > 100;\n```\n"""'}], 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'stream': False, 'temperature': 0.1}}

The filter's expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there's a matching row in the non-preserving side's table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned.\n```\n\nLogical Plan Changes After Rewrite: ```\n  LogicalSort(sort0=[$0(w_state)], sort1=[$1(i_item_id)], dir0=[ASC], dir1=[ASC], fetch=[100])\r\n    LogicalAggregate(group=[{0, 1}], sales_before=[SUM($2)], sales_after=[SUM($3)])\r\n      LogicalProject(w_state=[$71(w_state)], i_item_id=[$76(i_item_id)], $f2=[CASE(<($99(d_date), 1999-04-19), -($21(cs_sales_price), CASE(IS NOT NULL($57(cr_refunded_cash)), CAST($57(cr_refunded_cash)):DECIMAL(12, 2) NOT NULL, 0:DECIMAL(12, 2))), 0:DECIMAL(13, 2))], $f3=[CASE(>=($99(d_date), 1999-04-19), -($21(cs_sales_price), CASE(IS NOT NULL($57(cr_refunded_cash)), CAST($57(cr_refunded_cash)):DECIMAL(12, 2) NOT NULL, 0:DECIMAL(12, 2))), 0:DECIMAL(13, 2))])\r\n-       LogicalFilter(condition=[AND(=($75(i_item_sk), $15(cs_item_sk)), =($14(cs_warehouse_sk), $61(w_warehouse_sk)), =($0(cs_sold_date_sk), $97(d_date_sk)), >=($99(d_date), -(CAST('1999-04-19'):DATE NOT NULL, 2592000000:INTERVAL DAY)), <=($99(d_date), +(CAST('1999-04-19'):DATE NOT NULL, 2592000000:INTERVAL DAY)), =(CAST($87(i_category)):CHAR(6), 'Sports'), >=($95(i_manager_id), 61), <=($95(i_manager_id), 100), >=($19(cs_wholesale_cost), 13), <=($19(cs_wholesale_cost), 32), =($49(cr_reason_sk), 57))])\r\n+       LogicalJoin(condition=[=($0(cs_sold_date_sk), $97(d_date_sk))], joinType=[inner])\r\n-         LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n?

The original filter condition included a range condition on `d_date` using `>=` and `<=` operators with date arithmetic. After the rewrite, this condition has been replaced with a `SEARCH` condition using `Sarg` (Search Argument) notation, which simplifies the date range condition. Additionally, the conditions on `i_manager_id` and `cs_wholesale_cost` have also been transformed into `SEARCH` conditions.\n\nStep 2: Parsing the logical plan changes, we observe the following detailed changes in the SQL query:\n- The condition `d_date between (cast ('1999-04-19' as date) - interval '30' day) and (cast ('1999-04-19' as date) + interval '30' day)` is simplified to `SEARCH($99(d_date), Sarg[[1999-03-20..1999-05-19]])`.\n- The condition `i_manager_id between 61 and 100` is simplified to `SEARCH($95(i_manager_id), Sarg[[61..100]])`.\n- The condition `cs_wholesale_cost between 13 and 32` is simplified to `SEARCH($19(cs_wholesale_cost), Sarg[[13..32]])`.\n\nStep 3: The query rewrite rule contains multiple cases. The changes observed in the logical plan match Case 3 of the query rewrite rule. This case involves simplifying complex conditions based on known constraints or logical simplification. The transformation of `between` conditions to `SEARCH` conditions aligns with the simplification process described in Case 3.\n\nStep 4: The SQL query changes can be explained by Case 3 of the query rewrite rule. The original `WHERE` clause contained complex `between` conditions for `d_date`, `i_manager_id`, and `cs_wholesale_cost`. These conditions were simplified using `SEARCH` with `Sarg` notation, which is a more efficient way to express range queries. This transformation reduces redundancy and unnecessary complexity in the query, potentially improving query performance by allowing the database engine to optimize the search process more effectively. The simplification does not alter the logical outcome of the query but enhances its execution efficiency.", 'time': 5.423646688461304}

The filter's expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there's a matching row in the non-preserving side's table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned.\n```\n\nLogical Plan Changes After Rewrite: ```\n  LogicalSort(sort0=[$0(w_state)], sort1=[$1(i_item_id)], dir0=[ASC], dir1=[ASC], fetch=[100])\r\n    LogicalAggregate(group=[{0, 1}], sales_before=[SUM($2)], sales_after=[SUM($3)])\r\n      LogicalProject(w_state=[$71(w_state)], i_item_id=[$76(i_item_id)], $f2=[CASE(<($99(d_date), 1999-04-19), -($21(cs_sales_price), CASE(IS NOT NULL($57(cr_refunded_cash)), CAST($57(cr_refunded_cash)):DECIMAL(12, 2) NOT NULL, 0:DECIMAL(12, 2))), 0:DECIMAL(13, 2))], $f3=[CASE(>=($99(d_date), 1999-04-19), -($21(cs_sales_price), CASE(IS NOT NULL($57(cr_refunded_cash)), CAST($57(cr_refunded_cash)):DECIMAL(12, 2) NOT NULL, 0:DECIMAL(12, 2))), 0:DECIMAL(13, 2))])\r\n-       LogicalFilter(condition=[AND(=($75(i_item_sk), $15(cs_item_sk)), =($14(cs_warehouse_sk), $61(w_warehouse_sk)), =($0(cs_sold_date_sk), $97(d_date_sk)), >=($99(d_date), -(CAST('1999-04-19'):DATE NOT NULL, 2592000000:INTERVAL DAY)), <=($99(d_date), +(CAST('1999-04-19'):DATE NOT NULL, 2592000000:INTERVAL DAY)), =(CAST($87(i_category)):CHAR(6), 'Sports'), >=($95(i_manager_id), 61), <=($95(i_manager_id), 100), >=($19(cs_wholesale_cost), 13), <=($19(cs_wholesale_cost), 32), =($49(cr_reason_sk), 57))])\r\n+       LogicalJoin(condition=[=($0(cs_sold_date_sk), $97(d_date_sk))], joinType=[inner])\r\n-         LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n?

Specifically, the LEFT OUTER JOIN between `catalog_sales` and `catalog_returns` has been converted to an INNER JOIN. Additionally, several filter conditions have been moved from the WHERE clause to the ON clause of the INNER JOINs.\n\nStep 2: Parsing the logical plan changes, we observe the following detailed changes in the SQL query:\n- The LEFT OUTER JOIN between `catalog_sales` and `catalog_returns` on `(cs_order_number = cr_order_number and cs_item_sk = cr_item_sk)` has been changed to an INNER JOIN.\n- The filter condition `cr_reason_sk = 57`, which was originally in the WHERE clause, has been moved to a LogicalFilter applied directly to `catalog_returns`.\n- The filter condition `cs_wholesale_cost between 13 and 32`, which was originally in the WHERE clause, has been moved to a LogicalFilter applied directly to `catalog_sales`.\n- The joins between `catalog_sales`, `warehouse`, `item`, and `date_dim` have been converted to INNER JOINs with their respective conditions moved to the ON clauses.\n\nStep 3: The SQL query rewrite rule contains three cases. Based on the parsed SQL query changes:\n- Case 2 is matched because the original LEFT OUTER JOIN between `catalog_sales` and `catalog_returns` has been converted to an INNER JOIN, and the filter condition `cr_reason_sk = 57` applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side (`catalog_returns`) of the join.\n- Case 3 is also matched because the conversion of the LEFT OUTER JOIN to an INNER JOIN implies that the filter condition `cr_reason_sk = 57` mandates the presence of non-NULL values in `catalog_returns`, effectively requiring a match in `catalog_returns` for every row returned.\n\nStep 4: The SQL query changes can be explained as follows:\n- The original LEFT OUTER JOIN between `catalog_sales` and `catalog_returns` was transformed into an INNER JOIN because the filter condition `cr_reason_sk = 57` applies solely to `catalog_returns`, the non-preserving side of the join. This matches Case 2 of the rewrite rule, where such a filter can be moved into the ON clause of the join without altering the expected result set.\n- Additionally, the presence of the filter condition `cr_reason_sk = 57` ensures that only rows with a matching `cr_reason_sk` in `catalog_returns` are considered, effectively converting the OUTER JOIN to an INNER JOIN as described in Case 3. This conversion is efficient because it eliminates the possibility of NULL results from `catalog_returns`, aligning with the logic that requires a match in `catalog_returns` for every row returned.\n- The movement of filter conditions like `cs_wholesale_cost between 13 and 32` directly to the `catalog_sales` table scan further optimizes the query by reducing the dataset size before the join operations, enhancing query performance.', 'time': 6.854286432266235}

When the `LIMIT` clause is used to fetch a specified number of rows.\n2. When `ORDER BY` is used in conjunction with `LIMIT` to sort and limit the number of rows retrieved, particularly when sorting can leverage an index.\n3. When `DISTINCT` is used along with `LIMIT` to quickly identify and return unique rows without scanning the full dataset.\n4. During the use of `GROUP BY`, where optimization might involve sorting or traversing indexes in order to efficiently compute group values without processing the entire dataset.\n5. When sorting a specific number of rows from a single table based on non-indexed columns, utilizing in-memory sorting (`filesort`) techniques.\n**Transformations**: The specific SQL transformations that emerge from applying these optimization rules are:\n1. Combining `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY` encourages the database engine to stop the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained, avoiding full table sorts.\n2. Using `LIMIT` with `DISTINCT` leads to an early termination of the search for unique rows as soon as the needed amount is gathered, reducing time and resources spent on scanning the entire dataset.\n3. In the context of `GROUP BY`, optimizations may include indexing strategies or modifications to the way sorting is handled, such as employing `filesort` mechanisms that do not require temporary tables, ensuring that the database engine processes only the necessary data for group computations.\n4. Efficiencies are gained by encouraging the use of indexed columns with `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT`, making queries more efficient by reducing the cost associated with sorting and filtering operations.\n"""\nRule 3:\n"""\n**Conditions**: The SQL query rewrite rule applies when there are:\n- Functions or operations (especially deterministic ones) within the SELECT, WHERE, JOIN conditions, or any part of the query that is executed multiple times for the same row.\n- The presence of potentially computationally expensive operations or function calls that are not dependent on the data of the specific row and thus can be optimized.\n**Transformations**: 1. Move repeated function calls or operations outside of loops, if applicable. For example, if a function that generates a calculated value based on constants or parameters (not row-specific data) is being called in a loop, calculate the value once before the loop and store the result for reuse.\n   \n2. Replace inline functions in the SELECT or WHERE clause with a pre-calculated column if the function is deterministic and the input data does not change frequently. This might involve:\n   - Creating a temporary table that includes the results of the expensive function calls.\n   - Using a subquery or a Common Table Expression (CTE) that calculates the value once and then joins it with the main query.\n   \n3. When using aggregate functions that are called multiple times with the same parameters, consider storing the result in a variable or a temporary table, especially if the data set is large.\n\n4. Avoid using functions on indexed columns in the WHERE clause. This prevents the database from using the index efficiently. If a function must be used, consider creating a computed column that pre-calculates the function\'s result and index that column instead.\n\n5. If possible, simplify expressions and calculations to reduce their complexity and execution time. This might involve algebraic simplification or breaking down complex calculations into simpler parts that can be calculated separately and then combined.\n\nExample:\nOriginal Query:\n```sql\nSELECT id, name, expensive_function(column) as expensive_result\nFROM table\nWHERE expensive_function(column) > 100;\n```\n\nTransformed Query using a CTE:\n```sql\nWITH PreCalculated AS (\n  SELECT id, name, column, expensive_function(column) as expensive_result\n  FROM table\n)\nSELECT id, name, expensive_sel as expensive_result\nFROM PreCalculated\nWHERE expensive_result > 100;\n```\n"""'}], 'response': "Step 1: Analyze the given SQL query against each rewrite rule's conditions.\n\n- **Rule 1 Conditions**: \n  -

05:34:41,320 root INFO Generated queries:
Query 1: The SQL query changes can be explained as follows:
- The original LEFT OUTER JOIN between `catalog_sales` and `catalog_returns` was transformed into an INNER JOIN because the filter condition `cr_reason_sk = 57` applies solely to `catalog_returns`, the non-preserving side of the join. This matches Case 2 of the rewrite rule, where such a filter can be moved into the ON clause of the join without altering the expected result set.
- Additionally, the presence of the filter condition `cr_reason_sk = 57` ensures that only rows with a matching `cr_reason_sk` in `catalog_returns` are considered, effectively converting the OUTER JOIN to an INNER JOIN as described in Case 3. This conversion is efficient because it eliminates the possibility of NULL results from `catalog_returns`, aligning with the logic that requires a match in `catalog_returns` for every row returned.
- The movement of filter conditions like `cs_wholesale_cost between 13 and 32` directly to the `catalog_sales` table scan further optimizes the query by reducing the dataset size before the join operations, enhancing query performance.
Query 2: The SQL query changes can be explained by Case 3 of the query rewrite rule. The original `WHERE` clause contained complex `between` conditions for `d_date`, `i_manager_id`, and `cs_wholesale_cost`. These conditions were simplified using `SEARCH` with `Sarg` notation, which is a more efficient way to express range queries. This transformation reduces redundancy and unnecessary complexity in the query, potentially improving query performance by allowing the database engine to optimize the search process more effectively. The simplification does not alter the logical outcome of the query but enhances its execution efficiency.
Query 3: The SQL query matches Rule 1 because it involves `GROUP BY` and `JOIN` operations. To apply the transformation, we can rearrange the query to perform `GROUP BY` operations earlier. This can be achieved by using subqueries to pre-aggregate data before joining. 

For example, we can create a subquery that aggregates `catalog_sales` and `catalog_returns` data before joining with `warehouse`, `item`, and `date_dim`. This reduces the size of the dataset involved in the join operations, potentially improving performance.

Transformed Query:
```sql
WITH PreAggregatedSales AS (
  SELECT 
    cs_warehouse_sk, 
    cs_item_sk, 
    cs_sold_date_sk,
    sum(case when (cast(d_date as date) < cast ('1999-04-19' as date))
      then cs_sales_price - coalesce(cr_refunded_cash,0) else 0 end) as sales_before,
    sum(case when (cast(d_date as date) >= cast ('1999-04-19' as date))
      then cs_sales_price - coalesce(cr_refunded_cash,0) else 0 end) as sales_after
  FROM
    catalog_sales
    LEFT OUTER JOIN catalog_returns ON (cs_order_number = cr_order_number AND cs_item_sk = cr_item_sk)
  GROUP BY cs_warehouse_sk, cs_item_sk, cs_sold_date_sk
)
SELECT 
  w_state,
  i_item_id,
  sales_before,
  sales_after
FROM
  PreAggregatedSales
  JOIN warehouse ON PreAggregatedSales.cs_warehouse_sk = warehouse.w_warehouse_sk
  JOIN item ON PreAggregatedSales.cs_item_sk = item.i_item_sk
  JOIN date_dim ON PreAggregatedSales.cs_sold_date_sk = date_dim.d_date_sk
WHERE
  d_date BETWEEN (cast ('1999-04-19' as date) - interval '30' day) AND (cast ('1999-04-19' as date) + interval '30' day)
  AND i_category = 'Sports'
  AND i_manager_id BETWEEN 61 AND 100
  AND cs_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 13 AND 32
  AND cr_reason_sk = 57
GROUP BY w_state, i_item_id
ORDER BY w_state, i_item_id
LIMIT 100;
```
Query 4: The SQL query matches Rule 2 because it uses `LIMIT` and `ORDER BY`. The transformation involves ensuring that the database engine efficiently handles the sorting and limiting operations. By leveraging indexes on `w_state` and `i_item_id`, the database can stop sorting as soon as the required number of rows is obtained, reducing the workload.

If `w_state` and `i_item_id` are indexed, the query can be optimized to quickly retrieve the top 100 rows without performing a full sort. This transformation is more about ensuring the database configuration and indexing strategy are optimal rather than changing the SQL syntax itself.
Query 5: The SQL query matches Rule 3 because it uses deterministic functions like `cast` and `coalesce` multiple times. These functions can be pre-calculated to avoid repeated execution.

For instance, the `cast` operation on the date can be moved outside the loop, and the `coalesce` operation can be simplified by ensuring that `cr_refunded_cash` is handled efficiently. However, since these operations are already quite efficient, the main focus would be on ensuring that they do not hinder index usage.

"""The SQL query changes can be explained as follows:
- The original LEFT OUTER JOIN between `catalog_sales` and `catalog_returns` was transformed into an INNER JOIN because the filter condition `cr_reason_sk = 57` applies solely to `catalog_returns`, the non-preserving side of the join. This matches Case 2 of the rewrite rule, where such a filter can be moved into the ON clause of the join without altering the expected result set.
- Additionally, the presence of the filter condition `cr_reason_sk = 57` ensures that only rows with a matching `cr_reason_sk` in `catalog_returns` are considered, effectively converting the OUTER JOIN to an INNER JOIN as described in Case 3. This conversion is efficient because it eliminates the possibility of NULL results from `catalog_returns`, aligning with the logic that requires a match in `catalog_returns` for every row returned.
- The movement of filter conditions like `cs_wholesale_cost between 13 and 32` directly to the `catalog_sales` table scan further optimizes the query by reducing the dataset size before the join operations, enhancing query performance."""

Query Rewrite 2:
"""The SQL query changes can be explained by Case 3 of the query rewrite rule. The original `WHERE` clause contained complex `between` conditions for `d_date`, `i_manager_id`, and `cs_wholesale_cost`. These conditions were simplified using `SEARCH` with `Sarg` notation, which is a more efficient way to express range queries. This transformation reduces redundancy and unnecessary complexity in the query, potentially improving query performance by allowing the database engine to optimize the search process more effectively.

"""The SQL query matches Rule 1 because it involves `GROUP BY` and `JOIN` operations. To apply the transformation, we can rearrange the query to perform `GROUP BY` operations earlier. This can be achieved by using subqueries to pre-aggregate data before joining. 

For example, we can create a subquery that aggregates `catalog_sales` and `catalog_returns` data before joining with `warehouse`, `item`, and `date_dim`. This reduces the size of the dataset involved in the join operations, potentially improving performance.

05:34:46,684 root INFO Intermediate Results: {'suggestions_str': '### Suggestion 1:\n"""The SQL query changes can be explained as follows:\n- The original LEFT OUTER JOIN between `catalog_sales` and `catalog_returns` was transformed into an INNER JOIN because the filter condition `cr_reason_sk = 57` applies solely to `catalog_returns`, the non-preserving side of the join. This matches Case 2 of the rewrite rule, where such a filter can be moved into the ON clause of the join without altering the expected result set.\n- Additionally, the presence of the filter condition `cr_reason_sk = 57` ensures that only rows with a matching `cr_reason_sk` in `catalog_returns` are considered, effectively converting the OUTER JOIN to an INNER JOIN as described in Case 3. This conversion is efficient because it eliminates the possibility of NULL results from `catalog_returns`, aligning with the logic that requires a match in `catalog_returns` for every row returned.\n- The movement of filter conditions like `cs_wholesale_cost between 13 and 32` directly to the `catalog_sales` table scan further optimizes the query by reducing the dataset size before the join operations, enhancing query performance."""\n\n### Suggestion 2:\n"""The SQL query changes can be explained by Case 3 of the query rewrite rule. The original `WHERE` clause contained complex `between` conditions for `d_date`, `i_manager_id`, and `cs_wholesale_cost`. These conditions were simplified using `SEARCH` with `Sarg` notation, which is a more efficient way to express range queries. This transformation reduces redundancy and unnecessary complexity in the query, potentially improving query performance by allowing the database engine to optimize the search process more effectively. The simplification does not alter the logical outcome of the query but enhances its execution efficiency."""\n\n### Suggestion 3:\n"""The SQL query matches Rule 1 because it involves `GROUP BY` and `JOIN` operations.

This matches Case 2 of the rewrite rule, where such a filter can be moved into the ON clause of the join without altering the expected result set.\n- Additionally, the presence of the filter condition `cr_reason_sk = 57` ensures that only rows with a matching `cr_reason_sk` in `catalog_returns` are considered, effectively converting the OUTER JOIN to an INNER JOIN as described in Case 3. This conversion is efficient because it eliminates the possibility of NULL results from `catalog_returns`, aligning with the logic that requires a match in `catalog_returns` for every row returned.\n- The movement of filter conditions like `cs_wholesale_cost between 13 and 32` directly to the `catalog_sales` table scan further optimizes the query by reducing the dataset size before the join operations, enhancing query performance."""\n\n### Suggestion 2:\n"""The SQL query changes can be explained by Case 3 of the query rewrite rule. The original `WHERE` clause contained complex `between` conditions for `d_date`, `i_manager_id`, and `cs_wholesale_cost`. These conditions were simplified using `SEARCH` with `Sarg` notation, which is a more efficient way to express range queries. This transformation reduces redundancy and unnecessary complexity in the query, potentially improving query performance by allowing the database engine to optimize the search process more effectively. The simplification does not alter the logical outcome of the query but enhances its execution efficiency."""\n\n### Suggestion 3:\n"""The SQL query matches Rule 1 because it involves `GROUP BY` and `JOIN` operations. To apply the transformation, we can rearrange the query to perform `GROUP BY` operations earlier. This can be achieved by using subqueries to pre-aggregate data before joining. \n\nFor example, we can create a subquery that aggregates `catalog_sales` and `catalog_returns` data before joining with `warehouse`, `item`, and `date_dim`. This reduces the size of the dataset involved in the join operations, potentially improving performance.\n\nTransformed Query:\n```sql\nWITH PreAggregatedSales AS (\n  SELECT \n    cs_warehouse_sk, \n    cs_item_sk, \n    cs_sold_date_sk,\n    sum(case when (cast(d_date as date) < cast (\'1999-04-19\' as date))\n      then cs_sales_price - coalesce(cr_refunded_cash,0) else 0 end) as sales_before,\n    sum(case when (cast(d_date as date) >= cast (\'1999-04-19\' as date))\n      then cs_sales_price - coalesce(cr_refunded_cash,0) else 0 end) as sales_after\n  FROM\n    catalog_sales\n    LEFT OUTER JOIN catalog_returns ON (cs_order_number = cr_order_number AND cs_item_sk = cr_item_sk)\n  GROUP BY cs_warehouse_sk, cs_item_sk, cs_sold_date_sk\n)\nSELECT \n  w_state,\n  i_item_id,\n  sales_before,\n  sales_after\nFROM\n  PreAggregatedSales\n  JOIN warehouse ON PreAggregatedSales.cs_warehouse_sk = warehouse.w_warehouse_sk\n  JOIN item ON PreAggregatedSales.cs_item_sk = item.i_item_sk\n  JOIN date_dim ON PreAggregatedSales.cs_sold_date_sk = date_dim.d_date_sk\nWHERE\n  d_date BETWEEN (cast (\'1999-04-19\' as date) - interval \'30\' day) AND (cast (\'1999-04-19\' as date) + interval \'30\' day)\n  AND i_category = \'Sports\'\n  AND i_manager_id BETWEEN 61 AND 100\n  AND cs_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 13 AND 32\n  AND cr_reason_sk = 57\nGROUP BY w_state, i_item_id\nORDER BY w_state, i_item_id\nLIMIT 100;\n```"""\n\n### Suggestion 4:\n"""The SQL query matches Rule 2 because it uses `LIMIT` and `ORDER BY`. The transformation involves ensuring that the database engine efficiently handles the sorting and limiting operations. By leveraging indexes on `w_state` and `i_item_id`, the database can stop sorting as soon as the required number of rows is obtained, reducing the workload.\n\nIf `w_state` and `i_item_id` are indexed, the query can be optimized to quickly retrieve the top 100 rows without performing a full sort. This transformation is more about ensuring the database configuration and indexing strategy are optimal rather than changing the SQL syntax itself."""\n\n### Suggestion 5:\n"""The SQL query matches Rule 3 because it uses deterministic functions like `cast` and `coalesce` multiple times. These functions can be pre-calculated to avoid repeated execution.\n\nFor instance, the `cast` operation on the date can be moved outside the loop, and the `coalesce` operation can be simplified by ensuring that `cr_refunded_cash` is handled efficiently. However, since these operations are already quite efficient, the main focus would be on ensuring that they do not hinder index usage.\n\nTransformed Query:\n```sql\nWITH DateBoundaries AS (\n  SELECT \n    cast(\'1999-04-19\' as date) AS target_date,\n    cast(\'1999-04-19\' as date) - interval \'30\' day AS start_date,\n    cast(\'1999-04-19\' as date) + interval \'30\' day AS end_date\n)\nSELECT \n  w_state,\n  i_item_id,\n  sum(case when (d_date < target_date)\n    then cs_sales_price - coalesce(cr_refunded_cash,0) else 0 end) as sales_before,\n  sum(case when (d_date >= target_date)\n    then cs_sales_price - coalesce(cr_refunded_cash,0) else 0 end) as sales_after\nFROM\n  catalog_sales\n  LEFT OUTER JOIN catalog_returns ON (cs_order_number = cr_order_number AND cs_item_sk = cr_item_sk),\n  warehouse,\n  item,\n  date_dim,\n  DateBoundaries\nWHERE\n  i_item_sk = cs_item_sk\n  AND cs_warehouse_sk = w_warehouse_sk\n  AND cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk\n  AND d_date BETWEEN start_date AND end_date\n  AND i_category = \'Sports\'\n  AND i_manager_id BETWEEN 61 AND 100\n  AND cs_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 13 AND 32\n  AND cr_reason_sk = 57\nGROUP BY w_state, i_item_id\nORDER BY w_state, i_item_id\nLIMIT 100;\n```"""\n\nQuery Rewrite Rules:\n### Rule FILTER_INTO_JOIN:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: This SQL query rewrite rule applies when a filter condition is placed on the result set of an INNER JOIN operation.

The original `WHERE` clause contained complex `between` conditions for `d_date`, `i_manager_id`, and `cs_wholesale_cost`. These conditions were simplified using `SEARCH` with `Sarg` notation, which is a more efficient way to express range queries. This transformation reduces redundancy and unnecessary complexity in the query, potentially improving query performance by allowing the database engine to optimize the search process more effectively. The simplification does not alter the logical outcome of the query but enhances its execution efficiency."""\n\n### Suggestion 3:\n"""The SQL query matches Rule 1 because it involves `GROUP BY` and `JOIN` operations. To apply the transformation, we can rearrange the query to perform `GROUP BY` operations earlier. This can be achieved by using subqueries to pre-aggregate data before joining. \n\nFor example, we can create a subquery that aggregates `catalog_sales` and `catalog_returns` data before joining with `warehouse`, `item`, and `date_dim`.

The filter\'s expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there\'s a matching row in the non-preserving side\'s table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned."""\n\n### Rule FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains conditions that can be statically determined as always true (e.g., constant expressions like `1=1` or tautologies based on the column data types and constraints), then these conditions don\'t affect the result set.\n**Transformations**: Remove such conditions from the WHERE clause. If this results in an empty WHERE clause, remove the WHERE clause entirely.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause simplifies to conditions that are always false or involve comparisons with NULL in a way that the outcome is always false or NULL (e.g., `column != column` or `1=0`), indicating no rows can satisfy the filter.\n**Transformations**: Replace the query with one that selects no rows. This could be represented in different ways based on the SQL dialect. One universal method might be selecting from a dual table with a false condition.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains complex conditions that can be simplified based on known constraints, constants, or through logical simplification (e.g., `column IS NOT NULL AND column IS NOT NULL` simplifies to `column IS NOT NULL`).\n**Transformations**: Simplify the conditions according to logical rules and known constraints.

The filter\'s expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there\'s a matching row in the non-preserving side\'s table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned."""\n\n### Rule FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains conditions that can be statically determined as always true (e.g., constant expressions like `1=1` or tautologies based on the column data types and constraints), then these conditions don\'t affect the result set.\n**Transformations**: Remove such conditions from the WHERE clause. If this results in an empty WHERE clause, remove the WHERE clause entirely.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause simplifies to conditions that are always false or involve comparisons with NULL in a way that the outcome is always false or NULL (e.g., `column != column` or `1=0`), indicating no rows can satisfy the filter.\n**Transformations**: Replace the query with one that selects no rows. This could be represented in different ways based on the SQL dialect. One universal method might be selecting from a dual table with a false condition.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains complex conditions that can be simplified based on known constraints, constants, or through logical simplification (e.g., `column IS NOT NULL AND column IS NOT NULL` simplifies to `column IS NOT NULL`).\n**Transformations**: Simplify the conditions according to logical rules and known constraints.

Each suggestion corresponds to specific transformations that can be mapped to the rules provided. Here\'s how we can organize the rules:\n\n1. **FILTER Operator Rules**:\n   - Suggestion 1 indicates that the transformation involves converting a LEFT OUTER JOIN to an INNER JOIN due to a filter condition on the non-preserving side (`cr_reason_sk = 57`). This aligns with Case 3 of the `FILTER_INTO_JOIN` rule, which suggests converting OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when a WHERE clause mandates non-NULL values from the non-preserving side.\n   - Suggestion 2 involves simplifying complex `between` conditions, which aligns with the `FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS` rule, specifically Case 3, which involves simplifying complex conditions.\n   - Therefore, the `FILTER_INTO_JOIN` rule should be prioritized first, followed by `FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS`.\n\n2. **JOIN Operator Rules**:\n   - Suggestion 1 also involves moving filter conditions into the ON clause of the join, which is part of the `FILTER_INTO_JOIN` rule. Since this is the only rule in the JOIN Operator Rules, it should be prioritized.\n\nBased on these observations, the rules can be organized as follows:\n\nFILTER Operator Rules: ```python\n[\n    "FILTER_INTO_JOIN",\n    "FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS"\n]\n```\n\nJOIN Operator Rules: ```python\n[\n    "FILTER_INTO_JOIN"\n]\n```', 'time': 4.436441421508789}

This matches Case 2 of the rewrite rule, where such a filter can be moved into the ON clause of the join without altering the expected result set.\n- Additionally, the presence of the filter condition `cr_reason_sk = 57` ensures that only rows with a matching `cr_reason_sk` in `catalog_returns` are considered, effectively converting the OUTER JOIN to an INNER JOIN as described in Case 3. This conversion is efficient because it eliminates the possibility of NULL results from `catalog_returns`, aligning with the logic that requires a match in `catalog_returns` for every row returned.\n- The movement of filter conditions like `cs_wholesale_cost between 13 and 32` directly to the `catalog_sales` table scan further optimizes the query by reducing the dataset size before the join operations, enhancing query performance."""\n\n### Suggestion 2:\n"""The SQL query changes can be explained by Case 3 of the query rewrite rule. The original `WHERE` clause contained complex `between` conditions for `d_date`, `i_manager_id`, and `cs_wholesale_cost`. These conditions were simplified using `SEARCH` with `Sarg` notation, which is a more efficient way to express range queries. This transformation reduces redundancy and unnecessary complexity in the query, potentially improving query performance by allowing the database engine to optimize the search process more effectively. The simplification does not alter the logical outcome of the query but enhances its execution efficiency."""\n\n### Suggestion 3:\n"""The SQL query matches Rule 1 because it involves `GROUP BY` and `JOIN` operations. To apply the transformation, we can rearrange the query to perform `GROUP BY` operations earlier. This can be achieved by using subqueries to pre-aggregate data before joining. \n\nFor example, we can create a subquery that aggregates `catalog_sales` and `catalog_returns` data before joining with `warehouse`, `item`, and `date_dim`. This reduces the size of the dataset involved in the join operations, potentially improving performance.\n\nTransformed Query:\n```sql\nWITH PreAggregatedSales AS (\n  SELECT \n    cs_warehouse_sk, \n    cs_item_sk, \n    cs_sold_date_sk,\n    sum(case when (cast(d_date as date) < cast (\'1999-04-19\' as date))\n      then cs_sales_price - coalesce(cr_refunded_cash,0) else 0 end) as sales_before,\n    sum(case when (cast(d_date as date) >= cast (\'1999-04-19\' as date))\n      then cs_sales_price - coalesce(cr_refunded_cash,0) else 0 end) as sales_after\n  FROM\n    catalog_sales\n    LEFT OUTER JOIN catalog_returns ON (cs_order_number = cr_order_number AND cs_item_sk = cr_item_sk)\n  GROUP BY cs_warehouse_sk, cs_item_sk, cs_sold_date_sk\n)\nSELECT \n  w_state,\n  i_item_id,\n  sales_before,\n  sales_after\nFROM\n  PreAggregatedSales\n  JOIN warehouse ON PreAggregatedSales.cs_warehouse_sk = warehouse.w_warehouse_sk\n  JOIN item ON PreAggregatedSales.cs_item_sk = item.i_item_sk\n  JOIN date_dim ON PreAggregatedSales.cs_sold_date_sk = date_dim.d_date_sk\nWHERE\n  d_date BETWEEN (cast (\'1999-04-19\' as date) - interval \'30\' day) AND (cast (\'1999-04-19\' as date) + interval \'30\' day)\n  AND i_category = \'Sports\'\n  AND i_manager_id BETWEEN 61 AND 100\n  AND cs_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 13 AND 32\n  AND cr_reason_sk = 57\nGROUP BY w_state, i_item_id\nORDER BY w_state, i_item_id\nLIMIT 100;\n```"""\n\n### Suggestion 4:\n"""The SQL query matches Rule 2 because it uses `LIMIT` and `ORDER BY`. The transformation involves ensuring that the database engine efficiently handles the sorting and limiting operations. By leveraging indexes on `w_state` and `i_item_id`, the database can stop sorting as soon as the required number of rows is obtained, reducing the workload.\n\nIf `w_state` and `i_item_id` are indexed, the query can be optimized to quickly retrieve the top 100 rows without performing a full sort. This transformation is more about ensuring the database configuration and indexing strategy are optimal rather than changing the SQL syntax itself."""\n\n### Suggestion 5:\n"""The SQL query matches Rule 3 because it uses deterministic functions like `cast` and `coalesce` multiple times. These functions can be pre-calculated to avoid repeated execution.\n\nFor instance, the `cast` operation on the date can be moved outside the loop, and the `coalesce` operation can be simplified by ensuring that `cr_refunded_cash` is handled efficiently. However, since these operations are already quite efficient, the main focus would be on ensuring that they do not hinder index usage.\n\nTransformed Query:\n```sql\nWITH DateBoundaries AS (\n  SELECT \n    cast(\'1999-04-19\' as date) AS target_date,\n    cast(\'1999-04-19\' as date) - interval \'30\' day AS start_date,\n    cast(\'1999-04-19\' as date) + interval \'30\' day AS end_date\n)\nSELECT \n  w_state,\n  i_item_id,\n  sum(case when (d_date < target_date)\n    then cs_sales_price - coalesce(cr_refunded_cash,0) else 0 end) as sales_before,\n  sum(case when (d_date >= target_date)\n    then cs_sales_price - coalesce(cr_refunded_cash,0) else 0 end) as sales_after\nFROM\n  catalog_sales\n  LEFT OUTER JOIN catalog_returns ON (cs_order_number = cr_order_number AND cs_item_sk = cr_item_sk),\n  warehouse,\n  item,\n  date_dim,\n  DateBoundaries\nWHERE\n  i_item_sk = cs_item_sk\n  AND cs_warehouse_sk = w_warehouse_sk\n  AND cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk\n  AND d_date BETWEEN start_date AND end_date\n  AND i_category = \'Sports\'\n  AND i_manager_id BETWEEN 61 AND 100\n  AND cs_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 13 AND 32\n  AND cr_reason_sk = 57\nGROUP BY w_state, i_item_id\nORDER BY w_state, i_item_id\nLIMIT 100;\n```"""\n\nQuery Rewrite Rules:\n### Rule FILTER_INTO_JOIN:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: This SQL query rewrite rule applies when a filter condition is placed on the result set of an INNER JOIN operation. The filter\'s expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there\'s a matching row in the non-preserving side\'s table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned."""\n\n### Rule FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains conditions that can be statically determined as always true (e.g., constant expressions like `1=1` or tautologies based on the column data types and constraints), then these conditions don\'t affect the result set.\n**Transformations**: Remove such conditions from the WHERE clause. If this results in an empty WHERE clause, remove the WHERE clause entirely.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause simplifies to conditions that are always false or involve comparisons with NULL in a way that the outcome is always false or NULL (e.g., `column != column` or `1=0`), indicating no rows can satisfy the filter.\n**Transformations**: Replace the query with one that selects no rows. This could be represented in different ways based on the SQL dialect. One universal method might be selecting from a dual table with a false condition.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains complex conditions that can be simplified based on known constraints, constants, or through logical simplification (e.g., `column IS NOT NULL AND column IS NOT NULL` simplifies to `column IS NOT NULL`).\n**Transformations**: Simplify the conditions according to logical rules and known constraints. Remove redundancy and unnecessary complexity."""\n\nArranged Rule Sequence: ["FILTER_INTO_JOIN", "FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS"]\n\nUtilized Rules: ["FILTER_INTO_JOIN", "FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS"]\n\nUnutilized Rules: []'}], 'response': 'Step 1: Since there are no unutilized rules in the provided arrangement, we don\'t have any unutilized potential rules to prioritize over the utilized ones.
