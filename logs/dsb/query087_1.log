Additionally, this rule is particularly relevant when the columns in the `DISTINCT` query are supported by indexes.\n**Transformations**: - Rewriting the query to replace `DISTINCT` with a `GROUP BY` clause on the same columns used in the `DISTINCT` operation. This can improve execution efficiency by potentially taking advantage of indexes on these columns more effectively.\n- Ensuring that indexes match the columns specified in the `DISTINCT` operations to facilitate more efficient query processing. This transformation aims to reduce the need for the creation of temporary tables and, in turn, speed up query execution.\n"""\nRule 2:\n"""\n**Conditions**: The rule applies when the original SQL query performs multiple scans or joins on the same table to retrieve different attributes for certain conditions, or when the query structure results in redundant data processing and complexity that could be reduced.\n**Transformations**: - Combine multiple joins into a single join operation by using `CASE` statements to conditionally select different attributes from the table in one pass. \n- Use the `COALESCE` function in conjunction with `CASE` statements to efficiently merge conditional attributes into distinct columns based on specific criteria without the need for additional joins.\n- Optimize the selection of conditional attributes by integrating `GROUP BY` with aggregate functions like `MAX` within `CASE` statements, thus condensing the result set to only the necessary data and avoiding needless retrieval and processing steps.\n- The overall transformation leads to a single, more efficient query that accomplishes the tasks of multiple, less efficient operations, improving performance, and simplifying the query for better readability and maintenance.\n"""'}], 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'stream': False, 'temperature': 0.1}}

The filter's expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there's a matching row in the non-preserving side's table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned.\n```\n\nLogical Plan Changes After Rewrite: ```\n  LogicalAggregate(group=[{}], EXPR$0=[COUNT()])\r\n    LogicalProject($f0=[0])\r\n      LogicalMinus(all=[false])\r\n        LogicalMinus(all=[false])\r\n          LogicalAggregate(group=[{0, 1, 2}])\r\n            LogicalProject(c_last_name=[$60(c_last_name)], c_first_name=[$59(c_first_name)], d_date=[$25(d_date)])\r\n-             LogicalFilter(condition=[AND(=($0(ss_sold_date_sk), $23(d_date_sk)), =($3(ss_customer_sk), $51(c_customer_sk)), >=($26(d_month_seq), 1189), <=($26(d_month_seq), +(1189, 11)), >=($12(ss_list_price), 207), <=($12(ss_list_price), 236), >=($64(c_birth_year), 1934), <=($64(c_birth_year), 1940), >=($11(ss_wholesale_cost), 6), <=($11(ss_wholesale_cost), 16))])\r\n+             LogicalJoin(condition=[=($3(ss_customer_sk), $51(c_customer_sk))], joinType=[inner])\r\n-               LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n?

Specifically, the conditions involving range checks (e.g., `d_month_seq between 1189 and 1189+11`) have been replaced with `SEARCH` expressions (e.g., `SEARCH($26(d_month_seq), Sarg[[1189..1200]])`). This suggests that the rewrite rule has optimized the range conditions by converting them into a more efficient form for query execution.\n\nStep 2: Parsing the logical plan changes, we observe that the SQL query's `WHERE` clause conditions involving `BETWEEN` have been transformed. For example, `d_month_seq between 1189 and 1189+11` is replaced with `SEARCH($26(d_month_seq), Sarg[[1189..1200]])`. Similarly, other `BETWEEN` conditions like `ss_list_price between 207 and 236`, `c_birth_year BETWEEN 1934 AND 1940`, and `ss_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 6 AND 16` have been transformed into `SEARCH` expressions.\n\nStep 3: The query rewrite rule contains multiple cases. In this scenario, the changes match Case 3 of the query rewrite rule. Case 3 involves simplifying complex conditions based on known constraints or logical simplification. The transformation of `BETWEEN` conditions into `SEARCH` expressions is a form of logical simplification that optimizes the query execution.\n\nStep 4: The SQL query changes can be explained by Case 3 of the query rewrite rule. The original `WHERE` clause conditions used `BETWEEN` to specify ranges for `d_month_seq`, `ss_list_price`, `c_birth_year`, and `ss_wholesale_cost`. These conditions have been simplified by converting them into `SEARCH` expressions, which are more efficient for query execution. This transformation reduces redundancy and unnecessary complexity in the query, leading to potentially faster execution times. The use of `SEARCH` expressions allows the query optimizer to better understand and execute the range conditions, improving overall query performance.", 'time': 3.7142233848571777}

The filter's expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there's a matching row in the non-preserving side's table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned.\n```\n\nLogical Plan Changes After Rewrite: ```\n  LogicalAggregate(group=[{}], EXPR$0=[COUNT()])\r\n    LogicalProject($f0=[0])\r\n      LogicalMinus(all=[false])\r\n        LogicalMinus(all=[false])\r\n          LogicalAggregate(group=[{0, 1, 2}])\r\n            LogicalProject(c_last_name=[$60(c_last_name)], c_first_name=[$59(c_first_name)], d_date=[$25(d_date)])\r\n-             LogicalFilter(condition=[AND(=($0(ss_sold_date_sk), $23(d_date_sk)), =($3(ss_customer_sk), $51(c_customer_sk)), >=($26(d_month_seq), 1189), <=($26(d_month_seq), +(1189, 11)), >=($12(ss_list_price), 207), <=($12(ss_list_price), 236), >=($64(c_birth_year), 1934), <=($64(c_birth_year), 1940), >=($11(ss_wholesale_cost), 6), <=($11(ss_wholesale_cost), 16))])\r\n+             LogicalJoin(condition=[=($3(ss_customer_sk), $51(c_customer_sk))], joinType=[inner])\r\n-               LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n?

Specifically, the `LogicalFilter` nodes that contained conditions on columns from a single table have been replaced by `LogicalJoin` nodes with these conditions incorporated into the join predicates. This transformation is evident in the changes from `LogicalFilter` to `LogicalJoin` with additional conditions.\n\nStep 2: Parsing the logical plan changes, we observe the following detailed changes in the SQL query:\n- The conditions `d_month_seq between 1189 and 1189+11`, `ss_list_price between 207 and 236`, `cs_list_price between 207 and 236`, `ws_list_price between 207 and 236`, `ss_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 6 AND 16`, `cs_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 6 AND 16`, `ws_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 6 AND 16`, and `c_birth_year BETWEEN 1934 AND 1940` have been moved from the `WHERE` clause to the `ON` clause of the respective `INNER JOIN` operations.\n- The `INNER JOIN` conditions now include these additional filter conditions, effectively reducing the dataset size before the join operation.\n\nStep 3: The query rewrite rule contains multiple cases. The parsed SQL query changes match Case 1 of the query rewrite rule. This case applies when a filter condition is placed on the result set of an `INNER JOIN` operation, and the filter's expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join. The transformations involve moving these conditions into the `ON` clause of the `INNER JOIN`.\n\nStep 4: The SQL query changes can be explained by Case 1 of the query rewrite rule. The original SQL query had filter conditions applied after the `INNER JOIN` operations, which were only referencing columns from one side of the join (e.g., `store_sales`, `catalog_sales`, `web_sales`, `date_dim`, `customer`). According to Case 1, these conditions can be moved into the `ON` clause of the `INNER JOIN` to reduce the size of the datasets before the join occurs. This transformation optimizes the query by filtering the data earlier in the execution plan, thus potentially reducing the computational cost of the join operations. The logical plan changes reflect this optimization by showing the conditions integrated into the `LogicalJoin` nodes.", 'time': 4.625749826431274}

The query uses `DISTINCT` on multiple columns (`c_last_name`, `c_first_name`, `d_date`) but does not involve `ORDER BY`. The rule also suggests that the presence of indexes on these columns can enhance performance. However, the query does not explicitly mention indexes, and the rule\'s primary focus is on replacing `DISTINCT` with `GROUP BY` to leverage indexes.\n\n- **Rule 2 Conditions**: This rule applies when a query performs multiple scans or joins on the same table for different attributes, leading to redundant processing. The query involves multiple subqueries (`store_sales`, `catalog_sales`, `web_sales`) that join with `date_dim` and `customer` tables.

This structure results in redundant data processing.\n\nTo apply Rule 2, we can combine these subqueries into a single query using `CASE` statements to conditionally select data from `store_sales`, `catalog_sales`, or `web_sales`.

The original plan had multiple `LogicalAggregate` and `LogicalProject` layers, which have been simplified. The `LogicalAggregate` operations that grouped by `{0, 1, 2}` have been replaced with direct `LogicalProject` and `LogicalAggregate` operations on the data sources, indicating that the aggregation is now applied directly to the data sources without intermediate projections.\n\nStep 2: Parsing the logical plan changes, we see that the original SQL query had multiple subqueries with `EXCEPT` operations, each containing a `SELECT DISTINCT` clause. The rewrite has removed the `LogicalProject` layers that were projecting `c_last_name`, `c_first_name`, and `d_date` after the `LogicalAggregate`. Instead, these columns are now directly projected from the `LogicalAggregate` operations. The `LogicalAggregate` operations are now directly applied to the `store_sales`, `catalog_sales`, and `web_sales` tables, with the necessary joins and filters applied before aggregation.\n\nStep 3: The query rewrite rule contains two cases. Case 1 involves simplifying queries with `GROUP BY` clauses and aggregates, while Case 2 involves removing unnecessary inner `SELECT` layers when the outer query matches the inner query's columns. The parsed SQL query changes match Case 2, as the outer query's `SELECT` clause (`count(*)`) directly corresponds to the aggregation of the inner queries, and the inner `SELECT DISTINCT` clauses have been removed, allowing direct aggregation on the data sources.\n\nStep 4: The SQL query changes can be explained by Case 2 of the query rewrite rule. The original SQL query had three subqueries with `SELECT DISTINCT` clauses that were used to perform `EXCEPT` operations. Each subquery was projecting `c_last_name`, `c_first_name`, and `d_date` after performing distinct operations. The rewrite rule identified that these projections were unnecessary because the outer query was only interested in counting the distinct results. By removing the inner `SELECT DISTINCT` layers and directly applying the `LogicalAggregate` operations to the data sources, the query is simplified. The `LogicalMinus` operations now directly operate on the results of the `LogicalAggregate` operations, which are applied to the `store_sales`, `catalog_sales`, and `web_sales` tables with the necessary joins and filters.

05:52:56,262 root INFO Generated queries:
Query 1: The SQL query changes can be explained by Case 1 of the query rewrite rule. The original SQL query had filter conditions applied after the `INNER JOIN` operations, which were only referencing columns from one side of the join (e.g., `store_sales`, `catalog_sales`, `web_sales`, `date_dim`, `customer`). According to Case 1, these conditions can be moved into the `ON` clause of the `INNER JOIN` to reduce the size of the datasets before the join occurs. This transformation optimizes the query by filtering the data earlier in the execution plan, thus potentially reducing the computational cost of the join operations. The logical plan changes reflect this optimization by showing the conditions integrated into the `LogicalJoin` nodes.
Query 2: The SQL query changes can be explained by Case 2 of the query rewrite rule. The original SQL query had three subqueries with `SELECT DISTINCT` clauses that were used to perform `EXCEPT` operations. Each subquery was projecting `c_last_name`, `c_first_name`, and `d_date` after performing distinct operations. The rewrite rule identified that these projections were unnecessary because the outer query was only interested in counting the distinct results. By removing the inner `SELECT DISTINCT` layers and directly applying the `LogicalAggregate` operations to the data sources, the query is simplified. The `LogicalMinus` operations now directly operate on the results of the `LogicalAggregate` operations, which are applied to the `store_sales`, `catalog_sales`, and `web_sales` tables with the necessary joins and filters. This transformation reduces the complexity of the query and improves its efficiency by eliminating redundant projections and aggregations.
Query 3: The SQL query changes can be explained by Case 3 of the query rewrite rule. The original `WHERE` clause conditions used `BETWEEN` to specify ranges for `d_month_seq`, `ss_list_price`, `c_birth_year`, and `ss_wholesale_cost`. These conditions have been simplified by converting them into `SEARCH` expressions, which are more efficient for query execution. This transformation reduces redundancy and unnecessary complexity in the query, leading to potentially faster execution times. The use of `SEARCH` expressions allows the query optimizer to better understand and execute the range conditions, improving overall query performance.
Query 4: The SQL query matches the conditions of Rule 2. The query performs multiple joins on the `date_dim` and `customer` tables across three subqueries (`store_sales`, `catalog_sales`, `web_sales`). Each subquery retrieves the same set of columns (`c_last_name`, `c_first_name`, `d_date`) under similar conditions. This structure results in redundant data processing.

To apply Rule 2, we can combine these subqueries into a single query using `CASE` statements to conditionally select data from `store_sales`, `catalog_sales`, or `web_sales`. This approach reduces the number of joins and scans by consolidating the logic into one pass over the data. Additionally, using `COALESCE` and `GROUP BY` with aggregate functions like `MAX` can help merge the results efficiently.

Here's a conceptual transformation:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM (
  SELECT c_last_name, c_first_name, d_date
  FROM (
    SELECT 
      c_last_name, 
      c_first_name, 
      d_date,
      MAX(CASE WHEN ss_sold_date_sk IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS is_store_sales,
      MAX(CASE WHEN cs_sold_date_sk IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS is_catalog_sales,
      MAX(CASE WHEN ws_sold_date_sk IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS is_web_sales
    FROM date_dim
    JOIN customer ON customer.c_customer_sk = COALESCE(store_sales.ss_customer_sk, catalog_sales.cs_bill_customer_sk, web_sales.ws_bill_customer_sk)
    LEFT JOIN store_sales ON store_sales.ss_sold_date_sk = date_dim.d_date_sk
    LEFT JOIN catalog_sales ON catalog_sales.cs_sold_date_sk = date_dim.d_date_sk
    LEFT JOIN web_sales ON web_sales.ws_sold_date_sk = date_dim.d_date_sk
    WHERE d_month_seq BETWEEN 1189 AND 1189+11
      AND COALESCE(ss_list_price, cs_list_price, ws_list_price) BETWEEN 207 AND 236
      AND c_birth_year BETWEEN 1934 AND 1940
      AND COALESCE(ss_wholesale_cost, cs_wholesale_cost, ws_wholesale_cost) BETWEEN 6 AND 16
    GROUP BY c_last_name, c_first_name, d_date
  ) AS combined_sales
  WHERE is_store_sales = 1 AND is_catalog_sales = 0 AND is_web_sales = 0
) AS cool_cust;
```
This transformation reduces the complexity by consolidating the logic into a single query, thus improving performance and readability.

The query performs multiple joins on the `date_dim` and `customer` tables across three subqueries (`store_sales`, `catalog_sales`, `web_sales`). Each subquery retrieves the same set of columns (`c_last_name`, `c_first_name`, `d_date`) under similar conditions. This structure results in redundant data processing.  To apply Rule 2, we can combine these subqueries into a single query using `CASE` statements to conditionally select data from `store_sales`, `catalog_sales`, or `web_sales`.

Query Rewrite 1:
"""The SQL query changes can be explained by Case 1 of the query rewrite rule. The original SQL query had filter conditions applied after the `INNER JOIN` operations, which were only referencing columns from one side of the join (e.g., `store_sales`, `catalog_sales`, `web_sales`, `date_dim`, `customer`). According to Case 1, these conditions can be moved into the `ON` clause of the `INNER JOIN` to reduce the size of the datasets before the join occurs. This transformation optimizes the query by filtering the data earlier in the execution plan, thus potentially reducing the computational cost of the join operations. The logical plan changes reflect this optimization by showing the conditions integrated into the `LogicalJoin` nodes."""

Query Rewrite 2:
"""The SQL query changes can be explained by Case 2 of the query rewrite rule. The original SQL query had three subqueries with `SELECT DISTINCT` clauses that were used to perform `EXCEPT` operations. Each subquery was projecting `c_last_name`, `c_first_name`, and `d_date` after performing distinct operations. The rewrite rule identified that these projections were unnecessary because the outer query was only interested in counting the distinct results. By removing the inner `SELECT DISTINCT` layers and directly applying the `LogicalAggregate` operations to the data sources, the query is simplified. The `LogicalMinus` operations now directly operate on the results of the `LogicalAggregate` operations, which are applied to the `store_sales`, `catalog_sales`, and `web_sales` tables with the necessary joins and filters. This transformation reduces the complexity of the query and improves its efficiency by eliminating redundant projections and aggregations."""

Query Rewrite 3:
"""The SQL query changes can be explained by Case 3 of the query rewrite rule. The original `WHERE` clause conditions used `BETWEEN` to specify ranges for `d_month_seq`, `ss_list_price`, `c_birth_year`, and `ss_wholesale_cost`. These conditions have been simplified by converting them into `SEARCH` expressions, which are more efficient for query execution. This transformation reduces redundancy and unnecessary complexity in the query, leading to potentially faster execution times. The use of `SEARCH` expressions allows the query optimizer to better understand and execute the range conditions, improving overall query performance."""

Query Rewrite 4:
"""The SQL query matches the conditions of Rule 2. The query performs multiple joins on the `date_dim` and `customer` tables across three subqueries (`store_sales`, `catalog_sales`, `web_sales`). Each subquery retrieves the same set of columns (`c_last_name`, `c_first_name`, `d_date`) under similar conditions. This structure results in redundant data processing.

To apply Rule 2, we can combine these subqueries into a single query using `CASE` statements to conditionally select data from `store_sales`, `catalog_sales`, or `web_sales`. This approach reduces the number of joins and scans by consolidating the logic into one pass over the data. Additionally, using `COALESCE` and `GROUP BY` with aggregate functions like `MAX` can help merge the results efficiently.

Here's a conceptual transformation:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM (
  SELECT c_last_name, c_first_name, d_date
  FROM (
    SELECT 
      c_last_name, 
      c_first_name, 
      d_date,
      MAX(CASE WHEN ss_sold_date_sk IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS is_store_sales,
      MAX(CASE WHEN cs_sold_date_sk IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS is_catalog_sales,
      MAX(CASE WHEN ws_sold_date_sk IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS is_web_sales
    FROM date_dim
    JOIN customer ON customer.c_customer_sk = COALESCE(store_sales.ss_customer_sk, catalog_sales.cs_bill_customer_sk, web_sales.ws_bill_customer_sk)
    LEFT JOIN store_sales ON store_sales.ss_sold_date_sk = date_dim.d_date_sk
    LEFT JOIN catalog_sales ON catalog_sales.cs_sold_date_sk = date_dim.d_date_sk
    LEFT JOIN web_sales ON web_sales.ws_sold_date_sk = date_dim.d_date_sk
    WHERE d_month_seq BETWEEN 1189 AND 1189+11
      AND COALESCE(ss_list_price, cs_list_price, ws_list_price) BETWEEN 207 AND 236
      AND c_birth_year BETWEEN 1934 AND 1940
      AND COALESCE(ss_wholesale_cost, cs_wholesale_cost, ws_wholesale_cost) BETWEEN 6 AND 16
    GROUP BY c_last_name, c_first_name, d_date
  ) AS combined_sales
  WHERE is_store_sales = 1 AND is_catalog_sales = 0 AND is_web_sales = 0

According to Case 1, these conditions can be moved into the `ON` clause of the `INNER JOIN` to reduce the size of the datasets before the join occurs.

Each subquery was projecting `c_last_name`, `c_first_name`, and `d_date` after performing distinct operations. The rewrite rule identified that these projections were unnecessary because the outer query was only interested in counting the distinct results. By removing the inner `SELECT DISTINCT` layers and directly applying the `LogicalAggregate` operations to the data sources, the query is simplified. The `LogicalMinus` operations now directly operate on the results of the `LogicalAggregate` operations, which are applied to the `store_sales`, `catalog_sales`, and `web_sales` tables with the necessary joins and filters.

These conditions have been simplified by converting them into `SEARCH` expressions, which are more efficient for query execution. This transformation reduces redundancy and unnecessary complexity in the query, leading to potentially faster execution times.

The filter's expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set.

Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN.

This may involve moving computations or column transformations from the SELECT clause to a sub-query that the WHERE clause is applied on, ensuring the final SELECT clause on the outermost query matches the original query\'s expected outcome. - Before: SELECT col1, transformation_function(col2) FROM table WHERE condition; - After: SELECT col1, transformation_function(col2) FROM (SELECT col1, col2 FROM table WHERE condition) AS subquery;"""\n\n### Rule JOIN_TO_CORRELATE:\n"""**Conditions**: The join type is either INNER JOIN or LEFT JOIN. There are no requirements in the query that would inherently create NULL values on the left side when there are no matching rows on the right side (for INNER JOIN, this condition is naturally met; for LEFT JOIN, it is met if every row on the left side has at least one corresponding row on the right side according to the join condition).\n**Transformations**: 1. Identify the INNER JOIN or LEFT JOIN condition in the SQL query. 2. Extract the ON clause representing the join condition. 3. For INNER JOIN: - Replace the INNER JOIN with a WHERE EXISTS clause, moving the original join condition into the WHERE clause of a subquery that selects from the right side table. Reference the left side columns as correlation variables in the subquery\'s WHERE clause. - Example Transformation: SELECT * FROM left_table INNER JOIN right_table ON left_table.id = right_table.foreign_id Becomes: SELECT * FROM left_table WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM right_table WHERE left_table.id = right_table.foreign_id) 4. For LEFT JOIN: - Replace the LEFT JOIN with a LEFT OUTER JOIN subquery that is correlated to the outer query. In the SELECT clause of the outer query, include a CASE statement or similar logic to handle selection from the subquery result. - Example Transformation: SELECT left_table.*, right_table.* FROM left_table LEFT JOIN right_table ON left_table.id = right_table.foreign_id Becomes: SELECT left_table.*, COALESCE(subquery.alias1, \'default\') FROM left_table LEFT OUTER JOIN (SELECT foreign_id, column1 AS alias1 FROM right_table) subquery ON left_table.id = subquery.foreign_id"""'}], 'response': 'Step 1: Evaluate each suggestion against the provided query rewrite rules.\n\n### Suggestion 1:\n1. **Moving filter conditions into the `ON` clause of `INNER JOIN` operations**:\n   - **Rule FILTER_INTO_JOIN**: This rule directly applies as it involves moving filter conditions into the `ON` clause of `INNER JOIN` operations.

The first strategy involves moving filter conditions into the `ON` clause of `INNER JOIN` operations, which reduces dataset sizes before joining, thereby optimizing the query execution plan. The second strategy simplifies the query by removing unnecessary `SELECT DISTINCT` clauses within subqueries, allowing `LogicalAggregate` operations to be applied directly to data sources, thus reducing complexity and improving efficiency. The third strategy converts `BETWEEN` conditions into `SEARCH` expressions, which are more efficient for execution and enhance query performance by allowing the optimizer to better handle range conditions. Lastly, the fourth strategy consolidates multiple subqueries into a single query using `CASE` statements and `COALESCE`, reducing redundant data processing and improving performance by minimizing the number of joins and scans. This approach leverages `GROUP BY` with aggregate functions to efficiently merge results, enhancing both performance and readability."""\n\nQuery Rewrite Rules:\n### Rule FILTER_INTO_JOIN:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: This SQL query rewrite rule applies when a filter condition is placed on the result set of an INNER JOIN operation. The filter\'s expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there\'s a matching row in the non-preserving side\'s table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned."""\n\n### Rule AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: - The SQL query contains a `GROUP BY` clause that groups by simple columns (no expressions in the `GROUP BY` list).\n- The aggregate functions in the `SELECT` clause operate directly on columns (no expressions inside the aggregate functions).\n- The `SELECT` clause only contains the columns used in the `GROUP BY` clause and the aggregates without any transformations or additional expressions.\n**Transformations**: - Directly apply the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions to the data source referred to in the `FROM` clause of the inner query before the projection.\n- Eliminate the outer projection layer if it only renames the columns without transforming them.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: - The `SELECT` clause of an outer query precisely matches the columns used in the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions of an inner query, without any column transformations or renamings.\n- The inner `SELECT` only serves as a passthrough for these columns.\n**Transformations**: - Remove the inner `SELECT` layer, directly applying the aggregate functions and `GROUP BY` to the original data source."""\n\nRule Subset Sequences:\n### Rule Sequence 1: ["AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE"]\n\n### Rule Sequence 2: ["FILTER_INTO_JOIN"]\n\n### Rule Sequence 3: ["FILTER_INTO_JOIN"]\n\n### Rule Sequence 4: ["AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE"]'}], 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'stream': False, 'temperature': 0.1}}

The first strategy involves moving filter conditions into the `ON` clause of `INNER JOIN` operations, which reduces dataset sizes before joining, thereby optimizing the query execution plan. The second strategy simplifies the query by removing unnecessary `SELECT DISTINCT` clauses within subqueries, allowing `LogicalAggregate` operations to be applied directly to data sources, thus reducing complexity and improving efficiency. The third strategy converts `BETWEEN` conditions into `SEARCH` expressions, which are more efficient for execution and enhance query performance by allowing the optimizer to better handle range conditions. Lastly, the fourth strategy consolidates multiple subqueries into a single query using `CASE` statements and `COALESCE`, reducing redundant data processing and improving performance by minimizing the number of joins and scans. This approach leverages `GROUP BY` with aggregate functions to efficiently merge results, enhancing both performance and readability."""\n\nQuery Rewrite Rules:\n### Rule FILTER_INTO_JOIN:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: This SQL query rewrite rule applies when a filter condition is placed on the result set of an INNER JOIN operation. The filter\'s expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there\'s a matching row in the non-preserving side\'s table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned."""\n\n### Rule AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: - The SQL query contains a `GROUP BY` clause that groups by simple columns (no expressions in the `GROUP BY` list).\n- The aggregate functions in the `SELECT` clause operate directly on columns (no expressions inside the aggregate functions).\n- The `SELECT` clause only contains the columns used in the `GROUP BY` clause and the aggregates without any transformations or additional expressions.\n**Transformations**: - Directly apply the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions to the data source referred to in the `FROM` clause of the inner query before the projection.\n- Eliminate the outer projection layer if it only renames the columns without transforming them.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: - The `SELECT` clause of an outer query precisely matches the columns used in the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions of an inner query, without any column transformations or renamings.\n- The inner `SELECT` only serves as a passthrough for these columns.\n**Transformations**: - Remove the inner `SELECT` layer, directly applying the aggregate functions and `GROUP BY` to the original data source."""\n\nArranged Rule Sequence: ["FILTER_INTO_JOIN", "AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE"]\n\nUtilized Rules: ["FILTER_INTO_JOIN", "AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE"]\n\nUnutilized Rules: []'}], 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'stream': False, 'temperature': 0.1}}

For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned."""\n\n### Rule AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: - The SQL query contains a `GROUP BY` clause that groups by simple columns (no expressions in the `GROUP BY` list).\n- The aggregate functions in the `SELECT` clause operate directly on columns (no expressions inside the aggregate functions).\n- The `SELECT` clause only contains the columns used in the `GROUP BY` clause and the aggregates without any transformations or additional expressions.\n**Transformations**: - Directly apply the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions to the data source referred to in the `FROM` clause of the inner query before the projection.\n- Eliminate the outer projection layer if it only renames the columns without transforming them.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: - The `SELECT` clause of an outer query precisely matches the columns used in the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions of an inner query, without any column transformations or renamings.\n- The inner `SELECT` only serves as a passthrough for these columns.\n**Transformations**: - Remove the inner `SELECT` layer, directly applying the aggregate functions and `GROUP BY` to the original data source."""\n\nArranged Rule Sequence: ["FILTER_INTO_JOIN", "AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE"]\n\nUtilized Rules: ["FILTER_INTO_JOIN", "AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE"]\n\nUnutilized Rules: []'}], 'response': 'Step 1: Since there are no unutilized rules in the provided arrangement, we don\'t have any unutilized potential rules to prioritize over the utilized rules. Therefore, we will focus on the utilized rules and their alignment with the query rewrite suggestions.\n\nStep 2: The provided query rewrite suggestions include moving filter conditions into the `ON` clause of `INNER JOIN` operations, which aligns with the `FILTER_INTO_JOIN` rule. The suggestion to simplify the query by removing unnecessary `SELECT DISTINCT` clauses and directly applying `LogicalAggregate` operations aligns with the `AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE` rule. Since both rules are utilized and align with the suggestions, the current arrangement is already optimal. However, if we were to consider the other suggestions, such as converting `BETWEEN` conditions into `SEARCH` expressions or consolidating subqueries, we might need additional rules not currently listed.\n\nGiven the current rules and suggestions, the arrangement remains the same as it effectively utilizes the available rules.\n\n```python\n["FILTER_INTO_JOIN", "AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE"]\n```', 'time': 2.7444283962249756}
