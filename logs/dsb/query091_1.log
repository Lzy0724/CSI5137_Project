The filter's expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there's a matching row in the non-preserving side's table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned.\n```\n\nLogical Plan Changes After Rewrite: ```\n  LogicalSort(sort0=[$3(cr_net_loss)], dir0=[DESC])\r\n    LogicalProject(call_center=[$0(cc_call_center_id)], call_center_name=[$1(cc_name)], manager=[$2(cc_manager)], returns_loss=[$5(cr_net_loss)])\r\n      LogicalAggregate(group=[{0, 1, 2, 3, 4}], returns_loss=[SUM($5)])\r\n        LogicalProject(call_center=[$1(cc_call_center_id)], call_center_name=[$6(cc_name)], manager=[$11(cc_manager)], cd_marital_status=[$119(cd_marital_status)], cd_education_status=[$120(cd_education_status)], cr_net_loss=[$57(cr_net_loss)])\r\n-         LogicalFilter(condition=[AND(=($42(cr_call_center_sk), $0(cc_call_center_sk)), =($31(cr_returned_date_sk), $58(d_date_sk)), =($38(cr_returning_customer_sk), $86(c_customer_sk)), =($117(cd_demo_sk), $88(c_current_cdemo_sk)), =($126(hd_demo_sk), $89(c_current_hdemo_sk)), =($104(ca_address_sk), $90(c_current_addr_sk)), =($64(d_year), 2002), =($66(d_moy), 3), OR(AND(=(CAST($119(cd_marital_status)):CHAR(1), 'M'), =(CAST($120(cd_education_status)):CHAR(7), 'Unknown')), AND(=(CAST($119(cd_marital_status)):CHAR(1), 'W'), =(CAST($120(cd_education_status)):CHAR(15), 'Advanced Degree'))), LIKE($128(hd_buy_potential), '1001-5000%'), =(CAST($115(ca_gmt_offset)):DECIMAL(12, 2), -7))])\r\n-           LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n-             LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n-               LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n+         LogicalJoin(condition=[=($126(hd_demo_sk), $89(c_current_hdemo_sk))], joinType=[inner])\r\n+           LogicalJoin(condition=[=($117(cd_demo_sk), $88(c_current_cdemo_sk))], joinType=[inner])\r\n+             LogicalJoin(condition=[=($104(ca_address_sk), $90(c_current_addr_sk))], joinType=[inner])\r\n+               LogicalJoin(condition=[=($38(cr_returning_customer_sk), $86(c_customer_sk))], joinType=[inner])\r\n-                 LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n?                                          ^\n\n+                 LogicalJoin(condition=[=($31(cr_returned_date_sk), $58(d_date_sk))], joinType=[inner])\r\n?                                        +++++++++++ + ^ +++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n+                   LogicalJoin(condition=[=($42(cr_call_center_sk), $0(cc_call_center_sk))], joinType=[inner])\r\n-                   LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n-                     LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n-                       LogicalTableScan(table=[[call_center]])\r\n? --\n\n+                     LogicalTableScan(table=[[call_center]])\r\n-                       LogicalTableScan(table=[[catalog_returns]])\r\n? --\n\n+                     LogicalTableScan(table=[[catalog_returns]])\r\n+                   LogicalFilter(condition=[AND(=($6(d_year), 2002), =($8(d_moy), 3))])\r\n                      LogicalTableScan(table=[[date_dim]])\r\n-                   LogicalTableScan(table=[[customer]])\r\n? --\n\n+                 LogicalTableScan(table=[[customer]])\r\n+               LogicalFilter(condition=[=(CAST($11(ca_gmt_offset)):DECIMAL(12, 2), -7)])\r\n                  LogicalTableScan(table=[[customer_address]])\r\n+             LogicalFilter(condition=[OR(AND(=(CAST($2(cd_marital_status)):CHAR(1), 'M'), =(CAST($3(cd_education_status)):CHAR(7), 'Unknown')), AND(=(CAST($2(cd_marital_status)):CHAR(1), 'W'), =(CAST($3(cd_education_status)):CHAR(15), 'Advanced Degree')))])\r\n                LogicalTableScan(table=[[customer_demographics]])\r\n+           LogicalFilter(condition=[LIKE($2(hd_buy_potential), '1001-5000%')])\r\n              LogicalTableScan(table=[[household_demographics]])\r\n  \n```"}], 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'stream': False, 'temperature': 0.1}}

The `LogicalAggregate` operation's grouping columns have been changed from `{0, 1, 2, 3, 4}` to `{1, 6, 11, 119, 120}`, and the `SUM` function's argument has been changed from `$5` to `$57`. The `LogicalProject` operation has been removed, indicating that the projection layer that renamed columns has been eliminated.\n\nStep 2: Parsing the logical plan changes, we observe that the SQL query's `GROUP BY` clause originally grouped by `cc_call_center_id`, `cc_name`, `cc_manager`, `cd_marital_status`, and `cd_education_status`. The `SELECT` clause included these columns and the aggregate `SUM(cr_net_loss)`. The rewrite has removed the outer projection layer that renamed these columns (`cc_call_center_id` to `Call_Center`, `cc_name` to `Call_Center_Name`, `cc_manager` to `Manager`, and `SUM(cr_net_loss)` to `Returns_Loss`).\n\nStep 3: The query rewrite rule contains two cases. Case 1 applies when the `GROUP BY` clause groups by simple columns, and the `SELECT` clause contains only these columns and aggregates without transformations. Case 2 applies when the `SELECT` clause of an outer query matches the columns used in the `GROUP BY` and aggregates of an inner query, without transformations or renamings. The parsed SQL query changes match Case 1, as the `GROUP BY` clause groups by simple columns, and the `SELECT` clause contains these columns and aggregates without transformations.\n\nStep 4: In Case 1, the transformations involve directly applying the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions to the data source before the projection and eliminating the outer projection layer if it only renames columns. The SQL query changes reflect this: the `GROUP BY` and `SUM` operations are applied directly to the data source, and the outer projection layer that renamed columns has been removed. This results in a more efficient query execution plan by reducing unnecessary projection operations.", 'time': 4.950990915298462}

The filter's expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there's a matching row in the non-preserving side's table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned.\n```\n\nLogical Plan Changes After Rewrite: ```\n  LogicalSort(sort0=[$3(cr_net_loss)], dir0=[DESC])\r\n    LogicalProject(call_center=[$0(cc_call_center_id)], call_center_name=[$1(cc_name)], manager=[$2(cc_manager)], returns_loss=[$5(cr_net_loss)])\r\n      LogicalAggregate(group=[{0, 1, 2, 3, 4}], returns_loss=[SUM($5)])\r\n        LogicalProject(call_center=[$1(cc_call_center_id)], call_center_name=[$6(cc_name)], manager=[$11(cc_manager)], cd_marital_status=[$119(cd_marital_status)], cd_education_status=[$120(cd_education_status)], cr_net_loss=[$57(cr_net_loss)])\r\n-         LogicalFilter(condition=[AND(=($42(cr_call_center_sk), $0(cc_call_center_sk)), =($31(cr_returned_date_sk), $58(d_date_sk)), =($38(cr_returning_customer_sk), $86(c_customer_sk)), =($117(cd_demo_sk), $88(c_current_cdemo_sk)), =($126(hd_demo_sk), $89(c_current_hdemo_sk)), =($104(ca_address_sk), $90(c_current_addr_sk)), =($64(d_year), 2002), =($66(d_moy), 3), OR(AND(=(CAST($119(cd_marital_status)):CHAR(1), 'M'), =(CAST($120(cd_education_status)):CHAR(7), 'Unknown')), AND(=(CAST($119(cd_marital_status)):CHAR(1), 'W'), =(CAST($120(cd_education_status)):CHAR(15), 'Advanced Degree'))), LIKE($128(hd_buy_potential), '1001-5000%'), =(CAST($115(ca_gmt_offset)):DECIMAL(12, 2), -7))])\r\n-           LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n-             LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n-               LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n+         LogicalJoin(condition=[=($126(hd_demo_sk), $89(c_current_hdemo_sk))], joinType=[inner])\r\n+           LogicalJoin(condition=[=($117(cd_demo_sk), $88(c_current_cdemo_sk))], joinType=[inner])\r\n+             LogicalJoin(condition=[=($104(ca_address_sk), $90(c_current_addr_sk))], joinType=[inner])\r\n+               LogicalJoin(condition=[=($38(cr_returning_customer_sk), $86(c_customer_sk))], joinType=[inner])\r\n-                 LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n?                                          ^\n\n+                 LogicalJoin(condition=[=($31(cr_returned_date_sk), $58(d_date_sk))], joinType=[inner])\r\n?                                        +++++++++++ + ^ +++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n+                   LogicalJoin(condition=[=($42(cr_call_center_sk), $0(cc_call_center_sk))], joinType=[inner])\r\n-                   LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n-                     LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n-                       LogicalTableScan(table=[[call_center]])\r\n? --\n\n+                     LogicalTableScan(table=[[call_center]])\r\n-                       LogicalTableScan(table=[[catalog_returns]])\r\n? --\n\n+                     LogicalTableScan(table=[[catalog_returns]])\r\n+                   LogicalFilter(condition=[AND(=($6(d_year), 2002), =($8(d_moy), 3))])\r\n                      LogicalTableScan(table=[[date_dim]])\r\n-                   LogicalTableScan(table=[[customer]])\r\n? --\n\n+                 LogicalTableScan(table=[[customer]])\r\n+               LogicalFilter(condition=[=(CAST($11(ca_gmt_offset)):DECIMAL(12, 2), -7)])\r\n                  LogicalTableScan(table=[[customer_address]])\r\n+             LogicalFilter(condition=[OR(AND(=(CAST($2(cd_marital_status)):CHAR(1), 'M'), =(CAST($3(cd_education_status)):CHAR(7), 'Unknown')), AND(=(CAST($2(cd_marital_status)):CHAR(1), 'W'), =(CAST($3(cd_education_status)):CHAR(15), 'Advanced Degree')))])\r\n                LogicalTableScan(table=[[customer_demographics]])\r\n+           LogicalFilter(condition=[LIKE($2(hd_buy_potential), '1001-5000%')])\r\n              LogicalTableScan(table=[[household_demographics]])\r\n  \n```"}], 'response': "Step 1: The logical plan changes indicate that several filter conditions originally applied in a `LogicalFilter` node have been pushed down into the `LogicalJoin` nodes. Specifically, conditions that were part of the `WHERE` clause in the original SQL query have been moved into the `ON` clauses of the `INNER JOIN` operations. This transformation is evident from the removal of the `LogicalFilter` node and the addition of conditions in the `LogicalJoin` nodes.\n\nStep 2: Parsing the logical plan changes, we observe the following detailed changes in the SQL query:\n- The condition `cr_call_center_sk = cc_call_center_sk` is now part of the `ON` clause of the join between `call_center` and `catalog_returns`.\n- The condition `cr_returned_date_sk = d_date_sk` is now part of the `ON` clause of the join between `catalog_returns` and `date_dim`.\n- The condition `cr_returning_customer_sk = c_customer_sk` is now part of the `ON` clause of the join between `catalog_returns` and `customer`.\n- The condition `cd_demo_sk = c_current_cdemo_sk` is now part of the `ON` clause of the join between `customer_demographics` and `customer`.\n- The condition `hd_demo_sk = c_current_hdemo_sk` is now part of the `ON` clause of the join between `household_demographics` and `customer`.\n- The condition `ca_address_sk = c_current_addr_sk` is now part of the `ON` clause of the join between `customer_address` and `customer`.\n- The condition `d_year = 2002` and `d_moy = 3` are now applied directly to the `date_dim` table.\n- The condition `ca_gmt_offset = -7` is now applied directly to the `customer_address` table.\n- The condition involving `cd_marital_status` and `cd_education_status` is now applied directly to the `customer_demographics` table.\n- The condition `hd_buy_potential like '1001-5000%'` is now applied directly to the `household_demographics` table.\n\nStep 3: The parsed SQL query changes match Case 1 of the query rewrite rule. This case applies when filter conditions in a `WHERE` clause can be logically associated with columns from one side of an `INNER JOIN` and can be moved into the `ON` clause of the join. In this query, all the conditions moved involve columns from one side of their respective joins, making them suitable for this transformation.\n\nStep 4: The SQL query changes can be explained by Case 1 of the query rewrite rule. The original query had a `WHERE` clause with multiple conditions that could be logically associated with columns from one side of their respective `INNER JOIN` operations. By moving these conditions into the `ON` clauses of the joins, the query optimizer can potentially reduce the size of the datasets before the join occurs, improving query performance. For example, the condition `cr_call_center_sk = cc_call_center_sk` was moved into the `ON` clause of the join between `call_center` and `catalog_returns`, and similar transformations were applied to other conditions. This transformation aligns with the rule's goal of optimizing the query by reducing intermediate result sizes before performing joins.", 'time': 5.584579229354858}

05:54:07,359 root INFO Generated queries:
Query 1: The SQL query changes can be explained by Case 1 of the query rewrite rule. The original query had a `WHERE` clause with multiple conditions that could be logically associated with columns from one side of their respective `INNER JOIN` operations. By moving these conditions into the `ON` clauses of the joins, the query optimizer can potentially reduce the size of the datasets before the join occurs, improving query performance. For example, the condition `cr_call_center_sk = cc_call_center_sk` was moved into the `ON` clause of the join between `call_center` and `catalog_returns`, and similar transformations were applied to other conditions. This transformation aligns with the rule's goal of optimizing the query by reducing intermediate result sizes before performing joins.
Query 2: In Case 1, the transformations involve directly applying the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions to the data source before the projection and eliminating the outer projection layer if it only renames columns. The SQL query changes reflect this: the `GROUP BY` and `SUM` operations are applied directly to the data source, and the outer projection layer that renamed columns has been removed. This results in a more efficient query execution plan by reducing unnecessary projection operations.
Query 3: The SQL query contains a complex `WHERE` clause with `AND`/`OR` nesting: 
```sql
(cd_marital_status = 'M' and cd_education_status = 'Unknown') or (cd_marital_status = 'W' and cd_education_status = 'Advanced Degree')
```
Applying Rule 1's transformation, we can rewrite this as:
```sql
(cd_marital_status = 'M' or cd_marital_status = 'W') 
AND 
(cd_education_status = 'Unknown' or cd_education_status = 'Advanced Degree')
```
This transformation aims to potentially improve the efficiency of MySQL's execution by restructuring the logical conditions.
Query 4: The SQL query performs a `GROUP BY` operation along with multiple `JOIN` operations. According to Rule 3, we can enhance performance by rearranging the query to perform `GROUP BY` operations earlier. 

One approach is to use subqueries to pre-aggregate data before joining. For example, we can pre-aggregate the `catalog_returns` table by `cr_call_center_sk` and `cr_returned_date_sk` to reduce the dataset size early:

```sql
WITH pre_aggregated_returns AS (
    SELECT 
        cr_call_center_sk, 
        cr_returned_date_sk, 
        cr_returning_customer_sk, 
        SUM(cr_net_loss) AS total_net_loss
    FROM 
        catalog_returns
    GROUP BY 
        cr_call_center_sk, cr_returned_date_sk, cr_returning_customer_sk
)
SELECT  
    cc_call_center_id AS Call_Center,
    cc_name AS Call_Center_Name,
    cc_manager AS Manager,
    SUM(pre_aggregated_returns.total_net_loss) AS Returns_Loss
FROM
    call_center
JOIN 
    pre_aggregated_returns ON pre_aggregated_returns.cr_call_center_sk = cc_call_center_sk
JOIN 
    date_dim ON pre_aggregated_returns.cr_returned_date_sk = d_date_sk
JOIN 
    customer ON pre_aggregated_returns.cr_returning_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
JOIN 
    customer_address ON ca_address_sk = c_current_addr_sk
JOIN 
    customer_demographics ON cd_demo_sk = c_current_cdemo_sk
JOIN 
    household_demographics ON hd_demo_sk = c_current_hdemo_sk
WHERE
    d_year = 2002 
    AND d_moy = 3
    AND ((cd_marital_status = 'M' AND cd_education_status = 'Unknown') 
         OR (cd_marital_status = 'W' AND cd_education_status = 'Advanced Degree'))
    AND hd_buy_potential LIKE '1001-5000%'
    AND ca_gmt_offset = -7
GROUP BY 
    cc_call_center_id, cc_name, cc_manager, cd_marital_status, cd_education_status
ORDER BY 
    SUM(pre_aggregated_returns.total_net_loss) DESC;
```
This restructuring prioritizes the `GROUP BY` operation on the `catalog_returns` table, potentially reducing the workload on subsequent `JOIN` operations and enhancing overall execution speed and efficiency.

Query Rewrite 1:
"""The SQL query changes can be explained by Case 1 of the query rewrite rule. The original query had a `WHERE` clause with multiple conditions that could be logically associated with columns from one side of their respective `INNER JOIN` operations. By moving these conditions into the `ON` clauses of the joins, the query optimizer can potentially reduce the size of the datasets before the join occurs, improving query performance. For example, the condition `cr_call_center_sk = cc_call_center_sk` was moved into the `ON` clause of the join between `call_center` and `catalog_returns`, and similar transformations were applied to other conditions. This transformation aligns with the rule's goal of optimizing the query by reducing intermediate result sizes before performing joins."""

Query Rewrite 2:
"""In Case 1, the transformations involve directly applying the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions to the data source before the projection and eliminating the outer projection layer if it only renames columns. The SQL query changes reflect this: the `GROUP BY` and `SUM` operations are applied directly to the data source, and the outer projection layer that renamed columns has been removed. This results in a more efficient query execution plan by reducing unnecessary projection operations."""

Query Rewrite 3:
"""The SQL query contains a complex `WHERE` clause with `AND`/`OR` nesting: 
```sql
(cd_marital_status = 'M' and cd_education_status = 'Unknown') or (cd_marital_status = 'W' and cd_education_status = 'Advanced Degree')
```
Applying Rule 1's transformation, we can rewrite this as:
```sql
(cd_marital_status = 'M' or cd_marital_status = 'W') 
AND 
(cd_education_status = 'Unknown' or cd_education_status = 'Advanced Degree')
```
This transformation aims to potentially improve the efficiency of MySQL's execution by restructuring the logical conditions."""

Query Rewrite 4:
"""The SQL query performs a `GROUP BY` operation along with multiple `JOIN` operations. According to Rule 3, we can enhance performance by rearranging the query to perform `GROUP BY` operations earlier. 

One approach is to use subqueries to pre-aggregate data before joining. For example, we can pre-aggregate the `catalog_returns` table by `cr_call_center_sk` and `cr_returned_date_sk` to reduce the dataset size early:

```sql
WITH pre_aggregated_returns AS (
    SELECT 
        cr_call_center_sk, 
        cr_returned_date_sk, 
        cr_returning_customer_sk, 
        SUM(cr_net_loss) AS total_net_loss
    FROM 
        catalog_returns
    GROUP BY 
        cr_call_center_sk, cr_returned_date_sk, cr_returning_customer_sk
)
SELECT  
    cc_call_center_id AS Call_Center,
    cc_name AS Call_Center_Name,
    cc_manager AS Manager,
    SUM(pre_aggregated_returns.total_net_loss) AS Returns_Loss
FROM
    call_center
JOIN 
    pre_aggregated_returns ON pre_aggregated_returns.cr_call_center_sk = cc_call_center_sk
JOIN 
    date_dim ON pre_aggregated_returns.cr_returned_date_sk = d_date_sk
JOIN 
    customer ON pre_aggregated_returns.cr_returning_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
JOIN 
    customer_address ON ca_address_sk = c_current_addr_sk
JOIN 
    customer_demographics ON cd_demo_sk = c_current_cdemo_sk
JOIN 
    household_demographics ON hd_demo_sk = c_current_hdemo_sk
WHERE
    d_year = 2002 
    AND d_moy = 3
    AND ((cd_marital_status = 'M' AND cd_education_status = 'Unknown')

The filter's expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there's a matching row in the non-preserving side's table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned."}, {'name': 'AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE', 'rewrite': 'Case 1:\n**Conditions**: - The SQL query contains a `GROUP BY` clause that groups by simple columns (no expressions in the `GROUP BY` list).\n- The aggregate functions in the `SELECT` clause operate directly on columns (no expressions inside the aggregate functions).\n- The `SELECT` clause only contains the columns used in the `GROUP BY` clause and the aggregates without any transformations or additional expressions.\n**Transformations**: - Directly apply the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions to the data source referred to in the `FROM` clause of the inner query before the projection.\n- Eliminate the outer projection layer if it only renames the columns without transforming them.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: - The `SELECT` clause of an outer query precisely matches the columns used in the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions of an inner query, without any column transformations or renamings.\n- The inner `SELECT` only serves as a passthrough for these columns.\n**Transformations**: - Remove the inner `SELECT` layer, directly applying the aggregate functions and `GROUP BY` to the original data source.'}], [], [{'name': 'SORT_PROJECT_TRANSPOSE', 'rewrite': '**Conditions**: If a SQL query executes a sort operation on columns that are directly referenced in the SELECT list or through expressions that are strictly monotonic transformations of these columns, and the sort operation directly follows these projections (SELECT statements), the sort operation can be pushed to operate directly on the table (FROM clause) before the projection.\n**Transformations**: 1.

The original query had a `WHERE` clause with multiple conditions that could be logically associated with columns from one side of their respective `INNER JOIN` operations. By moving these conditions into the `ON` clauses of the joins, the query optimizer can potentially reduce the size of the datasets before the join occurs, improving query performance. For example, the condition `cr_call_center_sk = cc_call_center_sk` was moved into the `ON` clause of the join between `call_center` and `catalog_returns`, and similar transformations were applied to other conditions. This transformation aligns with the rule\'s goal of optimizing the query by reducing intermediate result sizes before performing joins."""\n\n### Suggestion 2:\n"""The provided SQL query rewrite strategies focus on optimizing query performance by restructuring the use of `GROUP BY` and `JOIN` operations. The first strategy suggests applying `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions directly to the data source before projection, eliminating unnecessary outer projection layers that only rename columns. This approach streamlines the query execution plan by reducing redundant operations. The second strategy involves pre-aggregating data using subqueries, specifically targeting the `catalog_returns` table. By performing `GROUP BY` operations earlier in the query process, the dataset size is reduced before subsequent `JOIN` operations, which can significantly enhance performance. This method leverages subqueries to aggregate data upfront, thereby minimizing the workload on later stages of the query and improving overall execution efficiency. Both strategies aim to optimize the query by reducing unnecessary computations and focusing on efficient data handling practices."""\n\n### Suggestion 3:\n"""The SQL query contains a complex `WHERE` clause with `AND`/`OR` nesting: \n```sql\n(cd_marital_status = \'M\' and cd_education_status = \'Unknown\') or (cd_marital_status = \'W\' and cd_education_status = \'Advanced Degree\')\n```\nApplying Rule 1\'s transformation, we can rewrite this as:\n```sql\n(cd_marital_status = \'M\' or cd_marital_status = \'W\') \nAND \n(cd_education_status = \'Unknown\' or cd_education_status = \'Advanced Degree\')\n```\nThis transformation aims to potentially improve the efficiency of MySQL\'s execution by restructuring the logical conditions."""\n\nQuery Rewrite Rules:\n### Rule FILTER_INTO_JOIN:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: This SQL query rewrite rule applies when a filter condition is placed on the result set of an INNER JOIN operation. The filter\'s expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there\'s a matching row in the non-preserving side\'s table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned."""\n\n### Rule AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: - The SQL query contains a `GROUP BY` clause that groups by simple columns (no expressions in the `GROUP BY` list).\n- The aggregate functions in the `SELECT` clause operate directly on columns (no expressions inside the aggregate functions).\n- The `SELECT` clause only contains the columns used in the `GROUP BY` clause and the aggregates without any transformations or additional expressions.\n**Transformations**: - Directly apply the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions to the data source referred to in the `FROM` clause of the inner query before the projection.\n- Eliminate the outer projection layer if it only renames the columns without transforming them.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: - The `SELECT` clause of an outer query precisely matches the columns used in the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions of an inner query, without any column transformations or renamings.\n- The inner `SELECT` only serves as a passthrough for these columns.\n**Transformations**: - Remove the inner `SELECT` layer, directly applying the aggregate functions and `GROUP BY` to the original data source."""\n\n### Rule SORT_PROJECT_TRANSPOSE:\n"""**Conditions**: If a SQL query executes a sort operation on columns that are directly referenced in the SELECT list or through expressions that are strictly monotonic transformations of these columns, and the sort operation directly follows these projections (SELECT statements), the sort operation can be pushed to operate directly on the table (FROM clause) before the projection.\n**Transformations**: 1. Check Compatibility: Ensure both sort and project (SELECT and ORDER BY clauses) involve compatible operations that relate directly to the raw column data or involve monotonic transformations.\n2. Analyze Order By Fields: Verify that each column in the ORDER BY clause is directly represented in the SELECT list or is a derived column through a monotonic transformation (e.g., casting integers to floats where the order is preserved).\n3. Adjust SQL Query: Rewrite the query so that sorting (ORDER BY clause) is applied to the raw table data in the FROM clause rather than after the projection.

For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there\'s a matching row in the non-preserving side\'s table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned."""\n\n### Rule AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: - The SQL query contains a `GROUP BY` clause that groups by simple columns (no expressions in the `GROUP BY` list).\n- The aggregate functions in the `SELECT` clause operate directly on columns (no expressions inside the aggregate functions).\n- The `SELECT` clause only contains the columns used in the `GROUP BY` clause and the aggregates without any transformations or additional expressions.\n**Transformations**: - Directly apply the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions to the data source referred to in the `FROM` clause of the inner query before the projection.\n- Eliminate the outer projection layer if it only renames the columns without transforming them.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: - The `SELECT` clause of an outer query precisely matches the columns used in the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions of an inner query, without any column transformations or renamings.\n- The inner `SELECT` only serves as a passthrough for these columns.\n**Transformations**: - Remove the inner `SELECT` layer, directly applying the aggregate functions and `GROUP BY` to the original data source."""\n\n### Rule SORT_PROJECT_TRANSPOSE:\n"""**Conditions**: If a SQL query executes a sort operation on columns that are directly referenced in the SELECT list or through expressions that are strictly monotonic transformations of these columns, and the sort operation directly follows these projections (SELECT statements), the sort operation can be pushed to operate directly on the table (FROM clause) before the projection.\n**Transformations**: 1. Check Compatibility: Ensure both sort and project (SELECT and ORDER BY clauses) involve compatible operations that relate directly to the raw column data or involve monotonic transformations.\n2. Analyze Order By Fields: Verify that each column in the ORDER BY clause is directly represented in the SELECT list or is a derived column through a monotonic transformation (e.g., casting integers to floats where the order is preserved).\n3. Adjust SQL Query: Rewrite the query so that sorting (ORDER BY clause) is applied to the raw table data in the FROM clause rather than after the projection. This might involve introducing a subquery or CTE (Common Table Expression) where the sorting is applied first, followed by the projections.\n4.

This may involve moving computations or column transformations from the SELECT clause to a sub-query that the WHERE clause is applied on, ensuring the final SELECT clause on the outermost query matches the original query\'s expected outcome. - Before: SELECT col1, transformation_function(col2) FROM table WHERE condition; - After: SELECT col1, transformation_function(col2) FROM (SELECT col1, col2 FROM table WHERE condition) AS subquery;"""\n\n### Rule AGGREGATE_REDUCE_FUNCTIONS:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: any SELECT statement or subquery using the AVG aggregate function\n**Transformations**: AVG(x) as SUM(x) / COUNT(x)\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: computing the population standard deviation\n**Transformations**: STDDEV_POP(x) as the square root of (`SUM(x^2) - SUM(x)^2 / COUNT(x)`) / COUNT(x)\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: for the sample standard deviation computation\n**Transformations**: STDDEV_SAMP(x) as the square root of (`SUM(x^2) - SUM(x)^2 / COUNT(x)`) / (COUNT(x) - 1)\nCase 4:\n**Conditions**: for the population variance computation\n**Transformations**: VAR_POP(x) as (`SUM(x^2) - SUM(x)^2 / COUNT(x)`) / COUNT(x)\nCase 5:\n**Conditions**: for the sample variance computation\n**Transformations**: VAR_SAMP(x) as (`SUM(x^2) - SUM(x)^2 / COUNT(x)`) / (COUNT(x) - 1)\nCase 6:\n**Conditions**: to compute population covariance\n**Transformations**: COVAR_POP(x, y) by applying a formula involving SUM and COUNT\nCase 7:\n**Conditions**: using a formula for sample covariance\n**Transformations**: COVAR_SAMP(x, y) using a formula involving SUM, COUNT, and an adjustment for sample calculations\nCase 8:\n**Conditions**: for transforming REGR_SXX(x, y) and REGR_SYY(x, y)\n**Transformations**: into expressions involving the computation of VAR_POP(x) or VAR_POP(y) respectively, multiplied by REGR_COUNT(x, y)"""\n\n### Rule JOIN_TO_CORRELATE:\n"""**Conditions**: The join type is either INNER JOIN or LEFT JOIN. There are no requirements in the query that would inherently create NULL values on the left side when there are no matching rows on the right side (for INNER JOIN, this condition is naturally met; for LEFT JOIN, it is met if every row on the left side has at least one corresponding row on the right side according to the join condition).\n**Transformations**: 1. Identify the INNER JOIN or LEFT JOIN condition in the SQL query. 2. Extract the ON clause representing the join condition. 3. For INNER JOIN: - Replace the INNER JOIN with a WHERE EXISTS clause, moving the original join condition into the WHERE clause of a subquery that selects from the right side table. Reference the left side columns as correlation variables in the subquery\'s WHERE clause. - Example Transformation: SELECT * FROM left_table INNER JOIN right_table ON left_table.id = right_table.foreign_id Becomes: SELECT * FROM left_table WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM right_table WHERE left_table.id = right_table.foreign_id) 4. For LEFT JOIN: - Replace the LEFT JOIN with a LEFT OUTER JOIN subquery that is correlated to the outer query. In the SELECT clause of the outer query, include a CASE statement or similar logic to handle selection from the subquery result. - Example Transformation: SELECT left_table.*, right_table.* FROM left_table LEFT JOIN right_table ON left_table.id = right_table.foreign_id Becomes: SELECT left_table.*, COALESCE(subquery.alias1, \'default\') FROM left_table LEFT OUTER JOIN (SELECT foreign_id, column1 AS alias1 FROM right_table) subquery ON left_table.id = subquery.foreign_id"""'}], 'response': 'Step 1: Evaluate each suggestion against the provided query rewrite rules.\n\n### Suggestion 1:\nThis suggestion involves moving filter conditions from the `WHERE` clause to the `ON` clause of `INNER JOIN` operations.

The filter\'s expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there\'s a matching row in the non-preserving side\'s table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned."""\n\n### Rule AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: - The SQL query contains a `GROUP BY` clause that groups by simple columns (no expressions in the `GROUP BY` list).\n- The aggregate functions in the `SELECT` clause operate directly on columns (no expressions inside the aggregate functions).\n- The `SELECT` clause only contains the columns used in the `GROUP BY` clause and the aggregates without any transformations or additional expressions.\n**Transformations**: - Directly apply the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions to the data source referred to in the `FROM` clause of the inner query before the projection.\n- Eliminate the outer projection layer if it only renames the columns without transforming them.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: - The `SELECT` clause of an outer query precisely matches the columns used in the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions of an inner query, without any column transformations or renamings.\n- The inner `SELECT` only serves as a passthrough for these columns.\n**Transformations**: - Remove the inner `SELECT` layer, directly applying the aggregate functions and `GROUP BY` to the original data source."""\n\n### Rule PROJECT_FILTER_TRANSPOSE:\n"""**Conditions**: This rewrite rule can be applied when an SQL query contains a SELECT operation (acting as the `Project` operation) followed by a WHERE clause (acting as the `Filter` operation), provided that the SELECT does not contain window functions (such as RANK(), ROW_NUMBER(), etc.) and the columns selected do not affect the outcome of the WHERE clause.\n**Transformations**: To apply the rule, refactor the SQL query so that the conditions in the WHERE clause are evaluated before the columns are selected in the SELECT clause. This may involve moving computations or column transformations from the SELECT clause to a sub-query that the WHERE clause is applied on, ensuring the final SELECT clause on the outermost query matches the original query\'s expected outcome. - Before: SELECT col1, transformation_function(col2) FROM table WHERE condition; - After: SELECT col1, transformation_function(col2) FROM (SELECT col1, col2 FROM table WHERE condition) AS subquery;"""'}], 'response': 'Step 1: To align the query rewrite rules with the provided suggestions, we need to analyze each suggestion and determine which rules are most relevant. \n\n- **Suggestion 1** emphasizes moving conditions from the `WHERE` clause to the `ON` clause of `JOIN` operations to reduce dataset sizes before joining. This aligns with the `FILTER_INTO_JOIN` rule, which suggests moving filter conditions into the `ON` clause of joins.\n\n- **Suggestion 2** focuses on optimizing `GROUP BY` and `JOIN` operations by applying aggregate functions earlier and using subqueries for pre-aggregation.

For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned."""\n\n### Rule AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: - The SQL query contains a `GROUP BY` clause that groups by simple columns (no expressions in the `GROUP BY` list).\n- The aggregate functions in the `SELECT` clause operate directly on columns (no expressions inside the aggregate functions).\n- The `SELECT` clause only contains the columns used in the `GROUP BY` clause and the aggregates without any transformations or additional expressions.\n**Transformations**: - Directly apply the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions to the data source referred to in the `FROM` clause of the inner query before the projection.\n- Eliminate the outer projection layer if it only renames the columns without transforming them.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: - The `SELECT` clause of an outer query precisely matches the columns used in the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions of an inner query, without any column transformations or renamings.\n- The inner `SELECT` only serves as a passthrough for these columns.\n**Transformations**: - Remove the inner `SELECT` layer, directly applying the aggregate functions and `GROUP BY` to the original data source."""\n\n### Rule PROJECT_FILTER_TRANSPOSE:\n"""**Conditions**: This rewrite rule can be applied when an SQL query contains a SELECT operation (acting as the `Project` operation) followed by a WHERE clause (acting as the `Filter` operation), provided that the SELECT does not contain window functions (such as RANK(), ROW_NUMBER(), etc.) and the columns selected do not affect the outcome of the WHERE clause.\n**Transformations**: To apply the rule, refactor the SQL query so that the conditions in the WHERE clause are evaluated before the columns are selected in the SELECT clause. This may involve moving computations or column transformations from the SELECT clause to a sub-query that the WHERE clause is applied on, ensuring the final SELECT clause on the outermost query matches the original query\'s expected outcome. - Before: SELECT col1, transformation_function(col2) FROM table WHERE condition; - After: SELECT col1, transformation_function(col2) FROM (SELECT col1, col2 FROM table WHERE condition) AS subquery;"""\n\nArranged Rule Sequence: ["AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE", "FILTER_INTO_JOIN", "PROJECT_FILTER_TRANSPOSE"]\n\nUtilized Rules: ["AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE", "FILTER_INTO_JOIN"]\n\nUnutilized Rules: ["PROJECT_FILTER_TRANSPOSE"]'}], 'response': 'Step 1: The unutilized rule "PROJECT_FILTER_TRANSPOSE" does not match any of the provided query rewrite suggestions.

Therefore, there is no need to prioritize the unutilized rule over the utilized ones.\n\nStep 2: Given that the utilized rules align with the suggestions, the sequence of rules should prioritize "FILTER_INTO_JOIN" first, as it directly addresses the suggestion to move conditions into `ON` clauses, which can significantly reduce dataset sizes before joins.
