When the `LIMIT` clause is used to fetch a specified number of rows.\n2. When `ORDER BY` is used in conjunction with `LIMIT` to sort and limit the number of rows retrieved, particularly when sorting can leverage an index.\n3. When `DISTINCT` is used along with `LIMIT` to quickly identify and return unique rows without scanning the full dataset.\n4. During the use of `GROUP BY`, where optimization might involve sorting or traversing indexes in order to efficiently compute group values without processing the entire dataset.\n5. When sorting a specific number of rows from a single table based on non-indexed columns, utilizing in-memory sorting (`filesort`) techniques.\n**Transformations**: The specific SQL transformations that emerge from applying these optimization rules are:\n1. Combining `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY` encourages the database engine to stop the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained, avoiding full table sorts.\n2. Using `LIMIT` with `DISTINCT` leads to an early termination of the search for unique rows as soon as the needed amount is gathered, reducing time and resources spent on scanning the entire dataset.\n3. In the context of `GROUP BY`, optimizations may include indexing strategies or modifications to the way sorting is handled, such as employing `filesort` mechanisms that do not require temporary tables, ensuring that the database engine processes only the necessary data for group computations.\n4. Efficiencies are gained by encouraging the use of indexed columns with `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT`, making queries more efficient by reducing the cost associated with sorting and filtering operations.\n"""\nRule 4:\n"""\n**Conditions**: The rule applies when the original SQL query performs multiple scans or joins on the same table to retrieve different attributes for certain conditions, or when the query structure results in redundant data processing and complexity that could be reduced.\n**Transformations**: - Combine multiple joins into a single join operation by using `CASE` statements to conditionally select different attributes from the table in one pass. \n- Use the `COALESCE` function in conjunction with `CASE` statements to efficiently merge conditional attributes into distinct columns based on specific criteria without the need for additional joins.\n- Optimize the selection of conditional attributes by integrating `GROUP BY` with aggregate functions like `MAX` within `CASE` statements, thus condensing the result set to only the necessary data and avoiding needless retrieval and processing steps.\n- The overall transformation leads to a single, more efficient query that accomplishes the tasks of multiple, less efficient operations, improving performance, and simplifying the query for better readability and maintenance.\n"""'}], 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'stream': False, 'temperature': 0.1}}

The `LogicalAggregate` operation has been adjusted to directly use the columns from the `LogicalFilter` without an intermediate projection. The `LogicalProject` layer that previously renamed columns has been removed, suggesting that the aggregation is now directly applied to the filtered data.\n\nStep 2: Parsing the logical plan changes, we observe that the `LogicalAggregate` now directly groups by the columns `cd_gender`, `cd_marital_status`, `cd_education_status`, `cd_purchase_estimate`, and `cd_credit_rating` without an intermediate projection. The `LogicalProject` that previously renamed these columns has been eliminated. This indicates that the aggregation and grouping are now directly applied to the data source after filtering, without an additional projection step.\n\nStep 3: The SQL query rewrite rule contains two cases. Case 1 involves conditions where the `GROUP BY` clause groups by simple columns, and the `SELECT` clause contains only these columns and aggregates without transformations. Case 2 involves conditions where the outer query's `SELECT` clause matches the `GROUP BY` and aggregates of an inner query. The parsed changes match Case 1, as the `GROUP BY` and aggregates are directly applied to the data source, and the outer projection layer is removed.\n\nStep 4: In Case 1, the SQL query changes involve directly applying the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions to the data source referred to in the `FROM` clause of the inner query before the projection. The outer projection layer is eliminated since it only renamed columns without transforming them. This is evident from the removal of the `LogicalProject` layer and the direct use of columns in the `LogicalAggregate`. The query now efficiently groups and aggregates data without unnecessary intermediate steps, aligning with the conditions and transformations specified in Case 1 of the rewrite rule.", 'time': 4.676023483276367}

The `LogicalCorrelate` and `LogicalJoin` operations in the rewritten plan suggest that the sub-queries have been replaced with join operations, which aligns with the transformations described in Case 2 of the query rewrite rule.\n\nStep 2: Parsing the logical plan changes, we observe the following detailed changes in the SQL query:\n- The `EXISTS` sub-query involving `store_sales` and `date_dim` has been transformed into an `INNER JOIN` between `customer`, `store_sales`, and `date_dim`.\n- The `NOT EXISTS` sub-queries involving `web_sales` and `catalog_sales` have been transformed into `LEFT JOIN` operations with `LogicalAggregate` and `LogicalProject` indicating the use of aggregation to ensure non-existence (i.e., checking for nulls).\n- The conditions within these sub-queries have been moved to the `LogicalFilter` operations after the joins.\n\nStep 3: The parsed SQL query changes match Case 2 of the query rewrite rule, specifically the transformations for `EXISTS` and `NOT EXISTS` sub-queries. The `EXISTS` sub-query has been converted into an `INNER JOIN`, and the `NOT EXISTS` sub-queries have been converted into `LEFT JOIN` operations with additional filtering to ensure non-existence.\n\nStep 4: The SQL query changes can be explained as follows:\n- The `EXISTS` sub-query in the original SQL query checks for the existence of matching rows in `store_sales` and `date_dim` for each customer. This has been transformed into an `INNER JOIN` between `customer`, `store_sales`, and `date_dim`, ensuring that only customers with matching sales records are included in the result set.\n- The `NOT EXISTS` sub-queries check for the non-existence of matching rows in `web_sales` and `catalog_sales`. These have been transformed into `LEFT JOIN` operations with `LogicalAggregate` and `LogicalProject` to ensure that if no matching rows exist, the join results in nulls, which are then filtered out using `IS NULL` conditions in the `LogicalFilter`.\n- These transformations optimize the query by replacing correlated sub-queries with join operations, which can be more efficient for execution in SQL engines.", 'time': 5.3255369663238525}

05:42:33,561 root INFO Generated queries:
Query 1: In Case 1, the SQL query changes involve directly applying the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions to the data source referred to in the `FROM` clause of the inner query before the projection. The outer projection layer is eliminated since it only renamed columns without transforming them. This is evident from the removal of the `LogicalProject` layer and the direct use of columns in the `LogicalAggregate`. The query now efficiently groups and aggregates data without unnecessary intermediate steps, aligning with the conditions and transformations specified in Case 1 of the rewrite rule.
Query 2: The SQL query changes can be explained as follows:
- The `EXISTS` sub-query in the original SQL query checks for the existence of matching rows in `store_sales` and `date_dim` for each customer. This has been transformed into an `INNER JOIN` between `customer`, `store_sales`, and `date_dim`, ensuring that only customers with matching sales records are included in the result set.
- The `NOT EXISTS` sub-queries check for the non-existence of matching rows in `web_sales` and `catalog_sales`. These have been transformed into `LEFT JOIN` operations with `LogicalAggregate` and `LogicalProject` to ensure that if no matching rows exist, the join results in nulls, which are then filtered out using `IS NULL` conditions in the `LogicalFilter`.
- These transformations optimize the query by replacing correlated sub-queries with join operations, which can be more efficient for execution in SQL engines.
Query 3: The original query uses `NOT EXISTS` to filter out customers who have made purchases in `web_sales` or `catalog_sales`. According to Rule 1, we can replace these `NOT EXISTS` subqueries with `EXCEPT` to potentially optimize the query by minimizing duplicate row processing. The transformation involves rewriting the `NOT EXISTS` conditions as follows:

This transformation replaces the `NOT EXISTS` subqueries with a single `EXCEPT` operation, which can be more efficient by reducing the number of checks needed for each customer.

"""In Case 1, the SQL query changes involve directly applying the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions to the data source referred to in the `FROM` clause of the inner query before the projection. The outer projection layer is eliminated since it only renamed columns without transforming them. This is evident from the removal of the `LogicalProject` layer and the direct use of columns in the `LogicalAggregate`. The query now efficiently groups and aggregates data without unnecessary intermediate steps, aligning with the conditions and transformations specified in Case 1 of the rewrite rule."""

Query Rewrite 2:
"""The SQL query changes can be explained as follows:
- The `EXISTS` sub-query in the original SQL query checks for the existence of matching rows in `store_sales` and `date_dim` for each customer. This has been transformed into an `INNER JOIN` between `customer`, `store_sales`, and `date_dim`, ensuring that only customers with matching sales records are included in the result set.
- The `NOT EXISTS` sub-queries check for the non-existence of matching rows in `web_sales` and `catalog_sales`. These have been transformed into `LEFT JOIN` operations with `LogicalAggregate` and `LogicalProject` to ensure that if no matching rows exist, the join results in nulls, which are then filtered out using `IS NULL` conditions in the `LogicalFilter`.
- These transformations optimize the query by replacing correlated sub-queries with join operations, which can be more efficient for execution in SQL engines."""

Query Rewrite 3:

This transformation replaces the `NOT EXISTS` subqueries with a single `EXCEPT` operation, which can be more efficient by reducing the number of checks needed for each customer."""

Query Rewrite 4:
"""Rule 2 suggests performing `GROUP BY` operations earlier to reduce the size of intermediate datasets. In this query, we can attempt to pre-aggregate data before joining with other tables. However, due to the complexity and dependencies of the joins and conditions, a direct transformation might not be straightforward without altering the logic of the query. Instead, we can focus on ensuring that the `GROUP BY` operation is as efficient as possible by ensuring indexes are used effectively on the grouped columns. This involves ensuring that the columns used in `GROUP BY` are indexed, which can be a part of query optimization strategies outside the SQL text itself."""

Query Rewrite 5:
"""The query uses `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY`, which Rule 3 suggests can be optimized by ensuring that the sorting process stops as soon as the required number of rows is obtained. This can be achieved by ensuring that the columns used in `ORDER BY` are indexed, which allows the database engine to efficiently sort and limit the rows. Additionally, the use of `LIMIT` in conjunction with `ORDER BY` inherently optimizes the query by reducing the number of rows processed after sorting. No specific SQL text transformation is needed, but ensuring proper indexing on `cd_gender`, `cd_marital_status`, `cd_education_status`, `cd_purchase_estimate`, and `cd_credit_rating` can enhance performance."""

The first strategy involves simplifying the query by applying `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions directly to the data source in the `FROM` clause of the inner query, thereby eliminating unnecessary intermediate steps such as the outer projection layer that only renames columns without transforming them. This approach enhances efficiency by directly grouping and aggregating data according to the specified conditions. The second strategy focuses on performing `GROUP BY` operations earlier in the query process to minimize the size of intermediate datasets. Although the complexity of joins and conditions may complicate direct transformations, ensuring that the `GROUP BY` operation is efficient can be achieved by using indexes effectively on the grouped columns. This involves optimizing the query execution plan by indexing the columns involved in the `GROUP BY` clause, which is a crucial part of query optimization beyond the SQL syntax itself."""\n\n### Suggestion 2:\n"""The provided SQL query can be optimized using two main strategies. The first strategy involves transforming the `EXISTS` and `NOT EXISTS` subqueries into join operations. Specifically, the `EXISTS` subquery is converted into an `INNER JOIN` between `customer`, `store_sales`, and `date_dim`, ensuring only customers with matching sales records are included. The `NOT EXISTS` subqueries are replaced with `LEFT JOIN` operations combined with `LogicalAggregate` and `LogicalProject`, filtering out non-matching rows using `IS NULL` conditions in a `LogicalFilter`. This approach optimizes the query by replacing correlated subqueries with more efficient join operations. The second strategy suggests replacing the `NOT EXISTS` subqueries with an `EXCEPT` operation. This involves rewriting the conditions to use `EXCEPT`, which can potentially optimize the query by minimizing duplicate row processing and reducing the number of checks needed for each customer. Both strategies aim to enhance query performance by leveraging more efficient SQL constructs."""\n\n### Suggestion 3:\n"""The query uses `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY`, which Rule 3 suggests can be optimized by ensuring that the sorting process stops as soon as the required number of rows is obtained. This can be achieved by ensuring that the columns used in `ORDER BY` are indexed, which allows the database engine to efficiently sort and limit the rows. Additionally, the use of `LIMIT` in conjunction with `ORDER BY` inherently optimizes the query by reducing the number of rows processed after sorting. No specific SQL text transformation is needed, but ensuring proper indexing on `cd_gender`, `cd_marital_status`, `cd_education_status`, `cd_purchase_estimate`, and `cd_credit_rating` can enhance performance."""\n\nQuery Rewrite Rules:\n### Rule AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: - The SQL query contains a `GROUP BY` clause that groups by simple columns (no expressions in the `GROUP BY` list).\n- The aggregate functions in the `SELECT` clause operate directly on columns (no expressions inside the aggregate functions).\n- The `SELECT` clause only contains the columns used in the `GROUP BY` clause and the aggregates without any transformations or additional expressions.\n**Transformations**: - Directly apply the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions to the data source referred to in the `FROM` clause of the inner query before the projection.\n- Eliminate the outer projection layer if it only renames the columns without transforming them.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: - The `SELECT` clause of an outer query precisely matches the columns used in the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions of an inner query, without any column transformations or renamings.\n- The inner `SELECT` only serves as a passthrough for these columns.\n**Transformations**: - Remove the inner `SELECT` layer, directly applying the aggregate functions and `GROUP BY` to the original data source."""\n\n### Rule FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: The query contains a scalar sub-query within the WHERE clause.\n**Transformations**: The scalar sub-query should be transformed into a LEFT JOIN operation with an aggregate function on the column(s) being selected in the sub-query.

The first strategy involves simplifying the query by applying `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions directly to the data source in the `FROM` clause of the inner query, thereby eliminating unnecessary intermediate steps such as the outer projection layer that only renames columns without transforming them. This approach enhances efficiency by directly grouping and aggregating data according to the specified conditions. The second strategy focuses on performing `GROUP BY` operations earlier in the query process to minimize the size of intermediate datasets. Although the complexity of joins and conditions may complicate direct transformations, ensuring that the `GROUP BY` operation is efficient can be achieved by using indexes effectively on the grouped columns. This involves optimizing the query execution plan by indexing the columns involved in the `GROUP BY` clause, which is a crucial part of query optimization beyond the SQL syntax itself."""\n\n### Suggestion 2:\n"""The provided SQL query can be optimized using two main strategies. The first strategy involves transforming the `EXISTS` and `NOT EXISTS` subqueries into join operations. Specifically, the `EXISTS` subquery is converted into an `INNER JOIN` between `customer`, `store_sales`, and `date_dim`, ensuring only customers with matching sales records are included. The `NOT EXISTS` subqueries are replaced with `LEFT JOIN` operations combined with `LogicalAggregate` and `LogicalProject`, filtering out non-matching rows using `IS NULL` conditions in a `LogicalFilter`. This approach optimizes the query by replacing correlated subqueries with more efficient join operations. The second strategy suggests replacing the `NOT EXISTS` subqueries with an `EXCEPT` operation. This involves rewriting the conditions to use `EXCEPT`, which can potentially optimize the query by minimizing duplicate row processing and reducing the number of checks needed for each customer. Both strategies aim to enhance query performance by leveraging more efficient SQL constructs."""\n\n### Suggestion 3:\n"""The query uses `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY`, which Rule 3 suggests can be optimized by ensuring that the sorting process stops as soon as the required number of rows is obtained. This can be achieved by ensuring that the columns used in `ORDER BY` are indexed, which allows the database engine to efficiently sort and limit the rows. Additionally, the use of `LIMIT` in conjunction with `ORDER BY` inherently optimizes the query by reducing the number of rows processed after sorting. No specific SQL text transformation is needed, but ensuring proper indexing on `cd_gender`, `cd_marital_status`, `cd_education_status`, `cd_purchase_estimate`, and `cd_credit_rating` can enhance performance."""\n\nQuery Rewrite Rule Sets:\n### AGGREGATE Operator Rules: ["AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE"]\n\n### CORRELATE Operator Rules: ["FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE", "JOIN_TO_CORRELATE"]\n\n### FILTER Operator Rules: ["FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE"]\n\n### JOIN Operator Rules: ["JOIN_TO_CORRELATE"]\n\n### PROJECT Operator Rules: ["AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE", "SORT_PROJECT_TRANSPOSE"]\n\n### SORT Operator Rules: ["SORT_PROJECT_TRANSPOSE"]\n\nQuery Rewrite Rule Explanations:\n### Rule AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: - The SQL query contains a `GROUP BY` clause that groups by simple columns (no expressions in the `GROUP BY` list).\n- The aggregate functions in the `SELECT` clause operate directly on columns (no expressions inside the aggregate functions).\n- The `SELECT` clause only contains the columns used in the `GROUP BY` clause and the aggregates without any transformations or additional expressions.\n**Transformations**: - Directly apply the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions to the data source referred to in the `FROM` clause of the inner query before the projection.\n- Eliminate the outer projection layer if it only renames the columns without transforming them.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: - The `SELECT` clause of an outer query precisely matches the columns used in the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions of an inner query, without any column transformations or renamings.\n- The inner `SELECT` only serves as a passthrough for these columns.\n**Transformations**: - Remove the inner `SELECT` layer, directly applying the aggregate functions and `GROUP BY` to the original data source."""\n\n### Rule FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: The query contains a scalar sub-query within the WHERE clause.\n**Transformations**: The scalar sub-query should be transformed into a LEFT JOIN operation with an aggregate function on the column(s) being selected in the sub-query.

This might not translate directly into SQL syntax without additional sub-query or DISTINCT aggregation."""\n\n### Rule SORT_PROJECT_TRANSPOSE:\n"""**Conditions**: If a SQL query executes a sort operation on columns that are directly referenced in the SELECT list or through expressions that are strictly monotonic transformations of these columns, and the sort operation directly follows these projections (SELECT statements), the sort operation can be pushed to operate directly on the table (FROM clause) before the projection.\n**Transformations**: 1. Check Compatibility: Ensure both sort and project (SELECT and ORDER BY clauses) involve compatible operations that relate directly to the raw column data or involve monotonic transformations.\n2. Analyze Order By Fields: Verify that each column in the ORDER BY clause is directly represented in the SELECT list or is a derived column through a monotonic transformation (e.g., casting integers to floats where the order is preserved).\n3. Adjust SQL Query: Rewrite the query so that sorting (ORDER BY clause) is applied to the raw table data in the FROM clause rather than after the projection. This might involve introducing a subquery or CTE (Common Table Expression) where the sorting is applied first, followed by the projections.\n4. Optimize Projection: Ensure that the SELECT list in the outer query matches the original projection, applying on top of the sorted data now."""\n\n### Rule JOIN_TO_CORRELATE:\n"""**Conditions**: The join type is either INNER JOIN or LEFT JOIN. There are no requirements in the query that would inherently create NULL values on the left side when there are no matching rows on the right side (for INNER JOIN, this condition is naturally met; for LEFT JOIN, it is met if every row on the left side has at least one corresponding row on the right side according to the join condition).\n**Transformations**: 1. Identify the INNER JOIN or LEFT JOIN condition in the SQL query. 2. Extract the ON clause representing the join condition. 3. For INNER JOIN: - Replace the INNER JOIN with a WHERE EXISTS clause, moving the original join condition into the WHERE clause of a subquery that selects from the right side table.

The first strategy involves simplifying the query by applying `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions directly to the data source in the `FROM` clause of the inner query, thereby eliminating unnecessary intermediate steps such as the outer projection layer that only renames columns without transforming them. This approach enhances efficiency by directly grouping and aggregating data according to the specified conditions. The second strategy focuses on performing `GROUP BY` operations earlier in the query process to minimize the size of intermediate datasets. Although the complexity of joins and conditions may complicate direct transformations, ensuring that the `GROUP BY` operation is efficient can be achieved by using indexes effectively on the grouped columns. This involves optimizing the query execution plan by indexing the columns involved in the `GROUP BY` clause, which is a crucial part of query optimization beyond the SQL syntax itself."""\n\n### Suggestion 2:\n"""The provided SQL query can be optimized using two main strategies. The first strategy involves transforming the `EXISTS` and `NOT EXISTS` subqueries into join operations. Specifically, the `EXISTS` subquery is converted into an `INNER JOIN` between `customer`, `store_sales`, and `date_dim`, ensuring only customers with matching sales records are included. The `NOT EXISTS` subqueries are replaced with `LEFT JOIN` operations combined with `LogicalAggregate` and `LogicalProject`, filtering out non-matching rows using `IS NULL` conditions in a `LogicalFilter`. This approach optimizes the query by replacing correlated subqueries with more efficient join operations. The second strategy suggests replacing the `NOT EXISTS` subqueries with an `EXCEPT` operation. This involves rewriting the conditions to use `EXCEPT`, which can potentially optimize the query by minimizing duplicate row processing and reducing the number of checks needed for each customer. Both strategies aim to enhance query performance by leveraging more efficient SQL constructs."""\n\n### Suggestion 3:\n"""The query uses `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY`, which Rule 3 suggests can be optimized by ensuring that the sorting process stops as soon as the required number of rows is obtained.

The first strategy involves simplifying the query by applying `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions directly to the data source in the `FROM` clause of the inner query, thereby eliminating unnecessary intermediate steps such as the outer projection layer that only renames columns without transforming them. This approach enhances efficiency by directly grouping and aggregating data according to the specified conditions. The second strategy focuses on performing `GROUP BY` operations earlier in the query process to minimize the size of intermediate datasets. Although the complexity of joins and conditions may complicate direct transformations, ensuring that the `GROUP BY` operation is efficient can be achieved by using indexes effectively on the grouped columns. This involves optimizing the query execution plan by indexing the columns involved in the `GROUP BY` clause, which is a crucial part of query optimization beyond the SQL syntax itself."""\n\n### Suggestion 2:\n"""The provided SQL query can be optimized using two main strategies. The first strategy involves transforming the `EXISTS` and `NOT EXISTS` subqueries into join operations. Specifically, the `EXISTS` subquery is converted into an `INNER JOIN` between `customer`, `store_sales`, and `date_dim`, ensuring only customers with matching sales records are included. The `NOT EXISTS` subqueries are replaced with `LEFT JOIN` operations combined with `LogicalAggregate` and `LogicalProject`, filtering out non-matching rows using `IS NULL` conditions in a `LogicalFilter`. This approach optimizes the query by replacing correlated subqueries with more efficient join operations. The second strategy suggests replacing the `NOT EXISTS` subqueries with an `EXCEPT` operation. This involves rewriting the conditions to use `EXCEPT`, which can potentially optimize the query by minimizing duplicate row processing and reducing the number of checks needed for each customer. Both strategies aim to enhance query performance by leveraging more efficient SQL constructs."""\n\n### Suggestion 3:\n"""The query uses `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY`, which Rule 3 suggests can be optimized by ensuring that the sorting process stops as soon as the required number of rows is obtained. This can be achieved by ensuring that the columns used in `ORDER BY` are indexed, which allows the database engine to efficiently sort and limit the rows. Additionally, the use of `LIMIT` in conjunction with `ORDER BY` inherently optimizes the query by reducing the number of rows processed after sorting. No specific SQL text transformation is needed, but ensuring proper indexing on `cd_gender`, `cd_marital_status`, `cd_education_status`, `cd_purchase_estimate`, and `cd_credit_rating` can enhance performance."""\n\nQuery Rewrite Rules:\n### Rule AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: - The SQL query contains a `GROUP BY` clause that groups by simple columns (no expressions in the `GROUP BY` list).\n- The aggregate functions in the `SELECT` clause operate directly on columns (no expressions inside the aggregate functions).\n- The `SELECT` clause only contains the columns used in the `GROUP BY` clause and the aggregates without any transformations or additional expressions.\n**Transformations**: - Directly apply the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions to the data source referred to in the `FROM` clause of the inner query before the projection.\n- Eliminate the outer projection layer if it only renames the columns without transforming them.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: - The `SELECT` clause of an outer query precisely matches the columns used in the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions of an inner query, without any column transformations or renamings.\n- The inner `SELECT` only serves as a passthrough for these columns.\n**Transformations**: - Remove the inner `SELECT` layer, directly applying the aggregate functions and `GROUP BY` to the original data source."""\n\n### Rule FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: The query contains a scalar sub-query within the WHERE clause.\n**Transformations**: The scalar sub-query should be transformed into a LEFT JOIN operation with an aggregate function on the column(s) being selected in the sub-query. The JOIN condition uses the correlation ID (the matching column(s) in both outer and sub-query).\n  - Original Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 WHERE column = (SELECT AGG_FUNCTION(column2) FROM table2 WHERE table1.join_column = table2.join_column)\n  - Transformed Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 LEFT JOIN (SELECT join_column, AGG_FUNCTION(column2) AS agg_result FROM table2 GROUP BY join_column) AS sub_query ON table1.join_column = sub_query.join_column WHERE column = sub_query.agg_result\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: The query contains `IN`, `EXISTS`, or `UNIQUE` sub-queries within the WHERE clause that are correlated with the outer query.\n**Transformations**: - For `IN` Sub-queries: Replace the `IN` clause with a JOIN operation and a WHERE condition that checks for non-null values on the side of the sub-query.\n    - Original Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 WHERE column IN (SELECT column2 FROM table2 WHERE table1.join_column = table2.join_column)\n    - Transformed Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.join_column = table2.join_column WHERE table2.column2 IS NOT NULL\n  - For `EXISTS` Sub-queries: Convert the `EXISTS` condition into a JOIN operation, using WHERE to filter rows that match the JOIN condition.\n    - Original Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM table2 WHERE table1.join_column = table2.join_class)\n    - Transformed Query Structure: SELECT DISTINCT table1.* FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.join_column = table2.join_column\n  - For `UNIQUE` Sub-queries: Since `UNIQUE` requires a bit more complex handling not directly mappable to a standard JOIN, it should be considered a special case where the goal is to ensure that rows from the outer query match a unique set in the sub-query. This might not translate directly into SQL syntax without additional sub-query or DISTINCT aggregation."""\n\n### Rule SORT_PROJECT_TRANSPOSE:\n"""**Conditions**: If a SQL query executes a sort operation on columns that are directly referenced in the SELECT list or through expressions that are strictly monotonic transformations of these columns, and the sort operation directly follows these projections (SELECT statements), the sort operation can be pushed to operate directly on the table (FROM clause) before the projection.\n**Transformations**: 1. Check Compatibility: Ensure both sort and project (SELECT and ORDER BY clauses) involve compatible operations that relate directly to the raw column data or involve monotonic transformations.\n2. Analyze Order By Fields: Verify that each column in the ORDER BY clause is directly represented in the SELECT list or is a derived column through a monotonic transformation (e.g., casting integers to floats where the order is preserved).\n3. Adjust SQL Query: Rewrite the query so that sorting (ORDER BY clause) is applied to the raw table data in the FROM clause rather than after the projection. This might involve introducing a subquery or CTE (Common Table Expression) where the sorting is applied first, followed by the projections.\n4. Optimize Projection: Ensure that the SELECT list in the outer query matches the original projection, applying on top of the sorted data now."""\n\n### Rule JOIN_TO_CORRELATE:\n"""**Conditions**: The join type is either INNER JOIN or LEFT JOIN. There are no requirements in the query that would inherently create NULL values on the left side when there are no matching rows on the right side (for INNER JOIN, this condition is naturally met; for LEFT JOIN, it is met if every row on the left side has at least one corresponding row on the right side according to the join condition).\n**Transformations**: 1. Identify the INNER JOIN or LEFT JOIN condition in the SQL query. 2. Extract the ON clause representing the join condition. 3. For INNER JOIN: - Replace the INNER JOIN with a WHERE EXISTS clause, moving the original join condition into the WHERE clause of a subquery that selects from the right side table. Reference the left side columns as correlation variables in the subquery\'s WHERE clause. - Example Transformation: SELECT * FROM left_table INNER JOIN right_table ON left_table.id = right_table.foreign_id Becomes: SELECT * FROM left_table WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM right_table WHERE left_table.id = right_table.foreign_id) 4. For LEFT JOIN: - Replace the LEFT JOIN with a LEFT OUTER JOIN subquery that is correlated to the outer query. In the SELECT clause of the outer query, include a CASE statement or similar logic to handle selection from the subquery result. - Example Transformation: SELECT left_table.*, right_table.* FROM left_table LEFT JOIN right_table ON left_table.id = right_table.foreign_id Becomes: SELECT left_table.*, COALESCE(subquery.alias1, \'default\') FROM left_table LEFT OUTER JOIN (SELECT foreign_id, column1 AS alias1 FROM right_table) subquery ON left_table.id = subquery.foreign_id"""\n\nRule Subset Sequences:\n### Rule Sequence 1: ["AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE"]\n\n### Rule Sequence 2: ["JOIN_TO_CORRELATE", "FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE"]\n\n### Rule Sequence 3: ["FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE"]\n\n### Rule Sequence 4: ["JOIN_TO_CORRELATE"]\n\n### Rule Sequence 5: ["AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE", "SORT_PROJECT_TRANSPOSE"]\n\n### Rule Sequence 6: ["SORT_PROJECT_TRANSPOSE"]'}], 'response': 'To optimize the given SQL query, we need to apply the provided query rewrite rules in a sequence that maximizes efficiency.

The second strategy suggests replacing the `NOT EXISTS` subqueries with an `EXCEPT` operation. This involves rewriting the conditions to use `EXCEPT`, which can potentially optimize the query by minimizing duplicate row processing and reducing the number of checks needed for each customer. Both strategies aim to enhance query performance by leveraging more efficient SQL constructs."""\n\n### Suggestion 3:\n"""The query uses `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY`, which Rule 3 suggests can be optimized by ensuring that the sorting process stops as soon as the required number of rows is obtained. This can be achieved by ensuring that the columns used in `ORDER BY` are indexed, which allows the database engine to efficiently sort and limit the rows. Additionally, the use of `LIMIT` in conjunction with `ORDER BY` inherently optimizes the query by reducing the number of rows processed after sorting. No specific SQL text transformation is needed, but ensuring proper indexing on `cd_gender`, `cd_marital_status`, `cd_education_status`, `cd_purchase_estimate`, and `cd_credit_rating` can enhance performance."""\n\nQuery Rewrite Rules:\n### Rule AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: - The SQL query contains a `GROUP BY` clause that groups by simple columns (no expressions in the `GROUP BY` list).\n- The aggregate functions in the `SELECT` clause operate directly on columns (no expressions inside the aggregate functions).\n- The `SELECT` clause only contains the columns used in the `GROUP BY` clause and the aggregates without any transformations or additional expressions.\n**Transformations**: - Directly apply the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions to the data source referred to in the `FROM` clause of the inner query before the projection.\n- Eliminate the outer projection layer if it only renames the columns without transforming them.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: - The `SELECT` clause of an outer query precisely matches the columns used in the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions of an inner query, without any column transformations or renamings.\n- The inner `SELECT` only serves as a passthrough for these columns.\n**Transformations**: - Remove the inner `SELECT` layer, directly applying the aggregate functions and `GROUP BY` to the original data source."""\n\n### Rule FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: The query contains a scalar sub-query within the WHERE clause.\n**Transformations**: The scalar sub-query should be transformed into a LEFT JOIN operation with an aggregate function on the column(s) being selected in the sub-query.

The first strategy involves simplifying the query by applying `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions directly to the data source in the `FROM` clause of the inner query, thereby eliminating unnecessary intermediate steps such as the outer projection layer that only renames columns without transforming them. This approach enhances efficiency by directly grouping and aggregating data according to the specified conditions. The second strategy focuses on performing `GROUP BY` operations earlier in the query process to minimize the size of intermediate datasets. Although the complexity of joins and conditions may complicate direct transformations, ensuring that the `GROUP BY` operation is efficient can be achieved by using indexes effectively on the grouped columns. This involves optimizing the query execution plan by indexing the columns involved in the `GROUP BY` clause, which is a crucial part of query optimization beyond the SQL syntax itself."""\n\n### Suggestion 2:\n"""The provided SQL query can be optimized using two main strategies.

The `NOT EXISTS` subqueries are replaced with `LEFT JOIN` operations combined with `LogicalAggregate` and `LogicalProject`, filtering out non-matching rows using `IS NULL` conditions in a `LogicalFilter`.
