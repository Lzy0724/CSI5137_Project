When the `LIMIT` clause is used to fetch a specified number of rows.\n2. When `ORDER BY` is used in conjunction with `LIMIT` to sort and limit the number of rows retrieved, particularly when sorting can leverage an index.\n3. When `DISTINCT` is used along with `LIMIT` to quickly identify and return unique rows without scanning the full dataset.\n4. During the use of `GROUP BY`, where optimization might involve sorting or traversing indexes in order to efficiently compute group values without processing the entire dataset.\n5. When sorting a specific number of rows from a single table based on non-indexed columns, utilizing in-memory sorting (`filesort`) techniques.\n**Transformations**: The specific SQL transformations that emerge from applying these optimization rules are:\n1. Combining `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY` encourages the database engine to stop the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained, avoiding full table sorts.\n2. Using `LIMIT` with `DISTINCT` leads to an early termination of the search for unique rows as soon as the needed amount is gathered, reducing time and resources spent on scanning the entire dataset.\n3. In the context of `GROUP BY`, optimizations may include indexing strategies or modifications to the way sorting is handled, such as employing `filesort` mechanisms that do not require temporary tables, ensuring that the database engine processes only the necessary data for group computations.\n4. Efficiencies are gained by encouraging the use of indexed columns with `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT`, making queries more efficient by reducing the cost associated with sorting and filtering operations.\n"""\nRule 3:\n"""\n**Conditions**: The SQL query rewrite rule applies when a query uses `DISTINCT` to remove duplicates, especially in the presence of multiple columns and when `ORDER BY` is involved. Additionally, this rule is particularly relevant when the columns in the `DISTINCT` query are supported by indexes.\n**Transformations**: - Rewriting the query to replace `DISTINCT` with a `GROUP BY` clause on the same columns used in the `DISTINCT` operation. This can improve execution efficiency by potentially taking advantage of indexes on these columns more effectively.\n- Ensuring that indexes match the columns specified in the `DISTINCT` operations to facilitate more efficient query processing. This transformation aims to reduce the need for the creation of temporary tables and, in turn, speed up query execution.\n"""\nRule 4:\n"""\n**Conditions**: The SQL query rewrite rule applies when there are:\n- Functions or operations (especially deterministic ones) within the SELECT, WHERE, JOIN conditions, or any part of the query that is executed multiple times for the same row.\n- The presence of potentially computationally expensive operations or function calls that are not dependent on the data of the specific row and thus can be optimized.\n**Transformations**: 1. Move repeated function calls or operations outside of loops, if applicable. For example, if a function that generates a calculated value based on constants or parameters (not row-specific data) is being called in a loop, calculate the value once before the loop and store the result for reuse.\n   \n2. Replace inline functions in the SELECT or WHERE clause with a pre-calculated column if the function is deterministic and the input data does not change frequently. This might involve:\n   - Creating a temporary table that includes the results of the expensive function calls.\n   - Using a subquery or a Common Table Expression (CTE) that calculates the value once and then joins it with the main query.\n   \n3. When using aggregate functions that are called multiple times with the same parameters, consider storing the result in a variable or a temporary table, especially if the data set is large.\n\n4. Avoid using functions on indexed columns in the WHERE clause. This prevents the database from using the index efficiently. If a function must be used, consider creating a computed column that pre-calculates the function\'s result and index that column instead.\n\n5. If possible, simplify expressions and calculations to reduce their complexity and execution time. This might involve algebraic simplification or breaking down complex calculations into simpler parts that can be calculated separately and then combined.\n\nExample:\nOriginal Query:\n```sql\nSELECT id, name, expensive_function(column) as expensive_result\nFROM table\nWHERE expensive_function(column) > 100;\n```\n\nTransformed Query using a CTE:\n```sql\nWITH PreCalculated AS (\n  SELECT id, name, column, expensive_function(column) as expensive_result\n  FROM table\n)\nSELECT id, name, expensive_sel as expensive_result\nFROM PreCalculated\nWHERE expensive_result > 100;\n```\n"""\nRule 5:\n"""\n**Conditions**: The rule applies when the original SQL query performs multiple scans or joins on the same table to retrieve different attributes for certain conditions, or when the query structure results in redundant data processing and complexity that could be reduced.\n**Transformations**: - Combine multiple joins into a single join operation by using `CASE` statements to conditionally select different attributes from the table in one pass. \n- Use the `COALESCE` function in conjunction with `CASE` statements to efficiently merge conditional attributes into distinct columns based on specific criteria without the need for additional joins.\n- Optimize the selection of conditional attributes by integrating `GROUP BY` with aggregate functions like `MAX` within `CASE` statements, thus condensing the result set to only the necessary data and avoiding needless retrieval and processing steps.\n- The overall transformation leads to a single, more efficient query that accomplishes the tasks of multiple, less efficient operations, improving performance, and simplifying the query for better readability and maintenance.\n"""'}], 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'stream': False, 'temperature': 0.1}}

The `EXISTS` sub-query has been transformed into an `INNER JOIN`, and the `NOT EXISTS` sub-query has been transformed into a `LEFT JOIN` with a filter for `IS NULL`.\n\nStep 2: Parsing the logical plan changes, we observe the following detailed changes in the SQL query:\n- The `EXISTS` sub-query:\n  ```sql\n  exists (select *\n          from web_sales ws2\n          where ws1.ws_order_number = ws2.ws_order_number\n            and ws1.ws_warehouse_sk <> ws2.ws_warehouse_sk)\n  ```\n  has been transformed into an `INNER JOIN`:\n  ```sql\n  INNER JOIN (SELECT ws_order_number FROM web_sales WHERE ws1.ws_order_number = ws2.ws_order_number AND ws1.ws_warehouse_sk <> ws2.ws_warehouse_sk)\n  ```\n- The `NOT EXISTS` sub-query:\n  ```sql\n  not exists(select *\n             from web_returns wr1\n             where ws1.ws_order_number = wr1.wr_order_number\n             and wr1.wr_reason_sk in (18, 23, 26, 35, 74))\n  ```\n  has been transformed into a `LEFT JOIN` with a filter for `IS NULL`:\n  ```sql\n  LEFT JOIN (SELECT wr_order_number FROM web_returns WHERE ws1.ws_order_number = wr1.wr_order_number AND wr1.wr_reason_sk IN (18, 23, 26, 35, 74)) ON ws1.ws_order_number = wr1.wr_order_number WHERE wr_order_number IS NULL\n  ```\n\nStep 3: The query rewrite rule contains multiple cases. Based on the parsed SQL query changes, the transformations match Case 2 of the query rewrite rule. This case handles `EXISTS` and `NOT EXISTS` sub-queries by converting them into join operations.\n\nStep 4: In the original SQL query, the `EXISTS` sub-query was used to ensure that there is at least one matching row in the `web_sales` table where the `ws_order_number` matches and the `ws_warehouse_sk` is different. This was transformed into an `INNER JOIN` to directly filter rows that meet these conditions. Similarly, the `NOT EXISTS` sub-query was used to ensure that there are no matching rows in the `web_returns` table with specific `wr_reason_sk` values. This was transformed into a `LEFT JOIN` with a filter for `IS NULL` to exclude rows where such matches exist. These transformations optimize the query by leveraging join operations, which can be more efficient than sub-queries in certain database systems.', 'time': 5.017362833023071}

Initially, there was a `LogicalAggregate` operation that grouped by an empty set and calculated aggregates like `COUNT(DISTINCT $0)`, `SUM($1)`, and `SUM($2)`. After the rewrite, the `LogicalAggregate` operation still groups by an empty set but now calculates aggregates like `COUNT(DISTINCT $17)`, `SUM($28)`, and `SUM($33)`. This suggests that the aggregation is now directly applied to the columns from the `web_sales` table, as indicated by the column indices.\n\nStep 2: Parsing the logical plan changes, we see that the `LogicalProject` layer, which previously selected columns `ws_order_number`, `ws_ext_ship_cost`, and `ws_net_profit`, has been removed. The aggregation now directly uses these columns from the `web_sales` table. The `LogicalFilter` and `LogicalJoin` operations remain largely unchanged, indicating that the filtering and joining logic is preserved, but the aggregation is now more directly applied to the data source.\n\nStep 3: The query rewrite rule contains two cases. Case 1 involves simplifying a query with a `GROUP BY` clause, but our original query does not contain a `GROUP BY` clause. Case 2 involves removing an inner `SELECT` layer when the outer query's `SELECT` clause matches the columns used in the inner query's `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions.

When the `LIMIT` clause is used to fetch a specified number of rows.\n2. When `ORDER BY` is used in conjunction with `LIMIT` to sort and limit the number of rows retrieved, particularly when sorting can leverage an index.\n3. When `DISTINCT` is used along with `LIMIT` to quickly identify and return unique rows without scanning the full dataset.\n4. During the use of `GROUP BY`, where optimization might involve sorting or traversing indexes in order to efficiently compute group values without processing the entire dataset.\n5. When sorting a specific number of rows from a single table based on non-indexed columns, utilizing in-memory sorting (`filesort`) techniques.\n**Transformations**: The specific SQL transformations that emerge from applying these optimization rules are:\n1. Combining `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY` encourages the database engine to stop the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained, avoiding full table sorts.\n2. Using `LIMIT` with `DISTINCT` leads to an early termination of the search for unique rows as soon as the needed amount is gathered, reducing time and resources spent on scanning the entire dataset.\n3. In the context of `GROUP BY`, optimizations may include indexing strategies or modifications to the way sorting is handled, such as employing `filesort` mechanisms that do not require temporary tables, ensuring that the database engine processes only the necessary data for group computations.\n4. Efficiencies are gained by encouraging the use of indexed columns with `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT`, making queries more efficient by reducing the cost associated with sorting and filtering operations.\n"""\nRule 3:\n"""\n**Conditions**: The SQL query rewrite rule applies when a query uses `DISTINCT` to remove duplicates, especially in the presence of multiple columns and when `ORDER BY` is involved. Additionally, this rule is particularly relevant when the columns in the `DISTINCT` query are supported by indexes.\n**Transformations**: - Rewriting the query to replace `DISTINCT` with a `GROUP BY` clause on the same columns used in the `DISTINCT` operation. This can improve execution efficiency by potentially taking advantage of indexes on these columns more effectively.\n- Ensuring that indexes match the columns specified in the `DISTINCT` operations to facilitate more efficient query processing. This transformation aims to reduce the need for the creation of temporary tables and, in turn, speed up query execution.\n"""\nRule 4:\n"""\n**Conditions**: The SQL query rewrite rule applies when there are:\n- Functions or operations (especially deterministic ones) within the SELECT, WHERE, JOIN conditions, or any part of the query that is executed multiple times for the same row.\n- The presence of potentially computationally expensive operations or function calls that are not dependent on the data of the specific row and thus can be optimized.\n**Transformations**: 1. Move repeated function calls or operations outside of loops, if applicable. For example, if a function that generates a calculated value based on constants or parameters (not row-specific data) is being called in a loop, calculate the value once before the loop and store the result for reuse.\n   \n2. Replace inline functions in the SELECT or WHERE clause with a pre-calculated column if the function is deterministic and the input data does not change frequently. This might involve:\n   - Creating a temporary table that includes the results of the expensive function calls.\n   - Using a subquery or a Common Table Expression (CTE) that calculates the value once and then joins it with the main query.\n   \n3. When using aggregate functions that are called multiple times with the same parameters, consider storing the result in a variable or a temporary table, especially if the data set is large.\n\n4. Avoid using functions on indexed columns in the WHERE clause. This prevents the database from using the index efficiently. If a function must be used, consider creating a computed column that pre-calculates the function\'s result and index that column instead.\n\n5. If possible, simplify expressions and calculations to reduce their complexity and execution time. This might involve algebraic simplification or breaking down complex calculations into simpler parts that can be calculated separately and then combined.\n\nExample:\nOriginal Query:\n```sql\nSELECT id, name, expensive_function(column) as expensive_result\nFROM table\nWHERE expensive_function(column) > 100;\n```\n\nTransformed Query using a CTE:\n```sql\nWITH PreCalculated AS (\n  SELECT id, name, column, expensive_function(column) as expensive_result\n  FROM table\n)\nSELECT id, name, expensive_sel as expensive_result\nFROM PreCalculated\nWHERE expensive_result > 100;\n```\n"""\nRule 5:\n"""\n**Conditions**: The rule applies when the original SQL query performs multiple scans or joins on the same table to retrieve different attributes for certain conditions, or when the query structure results in redundant data processing and complexity that could be reduced.\n**Transformations**: - Combine multiple joins into a single join operation by using `CASE` statements to conditionally select different attributes from the table in one pass. \n- Use the `COALESCE` function in conjunction with `CASE` statements to efficiently merge conditional attributes into distinct columns based on specific criteria without the need for additional joins.\n- Optimize the selection of conditional attributes by integrating `GROUP BY` with aggregate functions like `MAX` within `CASE` statements, thus condensing the result set to only the necessary data and avoiding needless retrieval and processing steps.\n- The overall transformation leads to a single, more efficient query that accomplishes the tasks of multiple, less efficient operations, improving performance, and simplifying the query for better readability and maintenance.\n"""'}], 'response': 'Step 1: Analyze the SQL query against each rule\'s conditions to determine applicability.\n\n- **Rule 1**: The query uses `EXISTS` and `NOT EXISTS`, which matches the condition of utilizing traditional filtering mechanisms.

Query 1: The SQL query changes can be explained by Case 2 of the query rewrite rule. The original query's `SELECT` clause aggregates columns from the `web_sales` table, and the rewrite removes the intermediate `LogicalProject` layer, directly applying the aggregate functions to the `web_sales` table. This is evident from the change in column indices used in the `LogicalAggregate` operation, which now directly reference the columns from the `web_sales` table. The rewrite optimizes the query by eliminating unnecessary projection, allowing the aggregation to be performed more efficiently.
Query 2: In the original SQL query, the `EXISTS` sub-query was used to ensure that there is at least one matching row in the `web_sales` table where the `ws_order_number` matches and the `ws_warehouse_sk` is different. This was transformed into an `INNER JOIN` to directly filter rows that meet these conditions. Similarly, the `NOT EXISTS` sub-query was used to ensure that there are no matching rows in the `web_returns` table with specific `wr_reason_sk` values. This was transformed into a `LEFT JOIN` with a filter for `IS NULL` to exclude rows where such matches exist. These transformations optimize the query by leveraging join operations, which can be more efficient than sub-queries in certain database systems.
Query 3: The query uses `EXISTS` and `NOT EXISTS` clauses. According to Rule 1, we can replace `NOT EXISTS` with `EXCEPT` to potentially optimize the query. The transformation involves changing:

```sql

```sql
and ws1.ws_order_number NOT IN (
  select wr1.wr_order_number
  from web_returns wr1
  where wr1.wr_reason_sk in (18, 23, 26, 35, 74)
)
```

This transformation uses `NOT IN` which can be further optimized by using `EXCEPT` if supported by the database:

```sql
and ws1.ws_order_number EXCEPT (
  select wr1.wr_order_number
  from web_returns wr1
  where wr1.wr_reason_sk in (18, 23, 26, 35, 74)

```
Query 4: The query uses `LIMIT` and `ORDER BY`, which matches Rule 2. The transformation involves ensuring that the database engine efficiently stops sorting once the required number of rows is obtained. This is more of an optimization hint rather than a direct SQL transformation. The query already uses `LIMIT` and `ORDER BY`, so no SQL code change is needed, but ensuring indexes on `ws_order_number` could enhance performance.
Query 5: The query uses `DISTINCT` on `ws_order_number` with `ORDER BY`. According to Rule 3, we can replace `DISTINCT` with `GROUP BY` to potentially improve execution efficiency:

```sql

Query Rewrite 1:
"""The SQL query changes can be explained by Case 2 of the query rewrite rule. The original query's `SELECT` clause aggregates columns from the `web_sales` table, and the rewrite removes the intermediate `LogicalProject` layer, directly applying the aggregate functions to the `web_sales` table. This is evident from the change in column indices used in the `LogicalAggregate` operation, which now directly reference the columns from the `web_sales` table. The rewrite optimizes the query by eliminating unnecessary projection, allowing the aggregation to be performed more efficiently."""

Query Rewrite 2:
"""In the original SQL query, the `EXISTS` sub-query was used to ensure that there is at least one matching row in the `web_sales` table where the `ws_order_number` matches and the `ws_warehouse_sk` is different. This was transformed into an `INNER JOIN` to directly filter rows that meet these conditions. Similarly, the `NOT EXISTS` sub-query was used to ensure that there are no matching rows in the `web_returns` table with specific `wr_reason_sk` values. This was transformed into a `LEFT JOIN` with a filter for `IS NULL` to exclude rows where such matches exist. These transformations optimize the query by leveraging join operations, which can be more efficient than sub-queries in certain database systems."""

Query Rewrite 3:
"""The query uses `EXISTS` and `NOT EXISTS` clauses. According to Rule 1, we can replace `NOT EXISTS` with `EXCEPT` to potentially optimize the query. The transformation involves changing:

Specifically, the `EXISTS` sub-query, which checks for matching rows in the `web_sales` table with different `ws_warehouse_sk` values, is converted into an `INNER JOIN`. Similarly, the `NOT EXISTS` sub-query, which ensures no matching rows in the `web_returns` table with specific `wr_reason_sk` values, is transformed into a `LEFT JOIN` with an `IS NULL` filter to exclude such matches. These transformations can enhance performance by utilizing more efficient join operations. The second strategy suggests replacing the `NOT EXISTS` clause with a `NOT IN` or `EXCEPT` clause.

Similarly, the `NOT EXISTS` sub-query, which ensures no matching rows in the `web_returns` table with specific `wr_reason_sk` values, is transformed into a `LEFT JOIN` with an `IS NULL` filter to exclude such matches. These transformations can enhance performance by utilizing more efficient join operations. The second strategy suggests replacing the `NOT EXISTS` clause with a `NOT IN` or `EXCEPT` clause. This involves changing the `NOT EXISTS` sub-query to a `NOT IN` list, which can be further optimized by using `EXCEPT` if the database supports it.

The first strategy involves transforming the `EXISTS` and `NOT EXISTS` sub-queries into join operations. Specifically, the `EXISTS` sub-query, which checks for matching rows in the `web_sales` table with different `ws_warehouse_sk` values, is converted into an `INNER JOIN`. Similarly, the `NOT EXISTS` sub-query, which ensures no matching rows in the `web_returns` table with specific `wr_reason_sk` values, is transformed into a `LEFT JOIN` with an `IS NULL` filter to exclude such matches. These transformations can enhance performance by utilizing more efficient join operations. The second strategy suggests replacing the `NOT EXISTS` clause with a `NOT IN` or `EXCEPT` clause. This involves changing the `NOT EXISTS` sub-query to a `NOT IN` list, which can be further optimized by using `EXCEPT` if the database supports it. These strategies aim to improve query execution by leveraging more efficient set operations and join mechanisms."""\n\n### Suggestion 2:\n"""The provided SQL query can be optimized using two main rewrite strategies. The first strategy involves removing the intermediate `LogicalProject` layer by directly applying aggregate functions to the `web_sales` table, as per Case 2 of the query rewrite rule. This change optimizes the query by eliminating unnecessary projections, allowing for more efficient aggregation by directly referencing the columns from the `web_sales` table. The second strategy, based on Rule 3, suggests replacing the `DISTINCT` keyword with a `GROUP BY` clause on `ws_order_number`. This modification can potentially enhance execution efficiency by grouping the results, which may streamline the counting process and improve performance when combined with the `ORDER BY` clause. Together, these strategies aim to refine the query\'s execution plan for better performance."""\n\n### Suggestion 3:\n"""The query uses a deterministic operation `cast(\'2000-6-01\' as date) + interval \'60\' day` in the `WHERE` clause. According to Rule 4, we can pre-calculate this value to avoid repeated computation:\n\n```sql\n-- Pre-calculate the date\nWITH PreCalculatedDate AS (\n  SELECT cast(\'2000-6-01\' as date) + interval \'60\' day as end_date\n)\nselect \n   count(distinct ws_order_number) as "order count"\n  ,sum(ws_ext_ship_cost) as "total shipping cost"\n  ,sum(ws_net_profit) as "total net profit"\nfrom\n   web_sales ws1\n  ,date_dim\n  ,customer_address\n  ,web_site\n  ,PreCalculatedDate\nwhere\n    d_date between \'2000-6-01\' and end_date\nand ws1.ws_ship_date_sk = d_date_sk\nand ws1.ws_ship_addr_sk = ca_address_sk\nand ca_state in (\'IL\',\'KY\',\'NE\'\n            ,\'PA\' ,\'VT\' ,\'WI\')\nand ws1.ws_web_site_sk = web_site_sk\nand web_gmt_offset >= -7\nand ws1.ws_list_price between 158 and 187\nand exists (select *\n            from web_sales ws2\n            where ws1.ws_order_number = ws2.ws_order_number\n              and ws1.ws_warehouse_sk <> ws2.ws_warehouse_sk)\nand not exists(select *\n               from web_returns wr1\n               where ws1.ws_order_number = wr1.wr_order_number\n               and wr1.wr_reason_sk in (18, 23, 26, 35, 74)\n               )\norder by count(distinct ws_order_number)\nlimit 100;\n```"""\n\n### Suggestion 4:\n"""The query uses `LIMIT` and `ORDER BY`, which matches Rule 2. The transformation involves ensuring that the database engine efficiently stops sorting once the required number of rows is obtained. This is more of an optimization hint rather than a direct SQL transformation. The query already uses `LIMIT` and `ORDER BY`, so no SQL code change is needed, but ensuring indexes on `ws_order_number` could enhance performance."""\n\nQuery Rewrite Rules:\n### Rule AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: - The SQL query contains a `GROUP BY` clause that groups by simple columns (no expressions in the `GROUP BY` list).\n- The aggregate functions in the `SELECT` clause operate directly on columns (no expressions inside the aggregate functions).\n- The `SELECT` clause only contains the columns used in the `GROUP BY` clause and the aggregates without any transformations or additional expressions.\n**Transformations**: - Directly apply the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions to the data source referred to in the `FROM` clause of the inner query before the projection.\n- Eliminate the outer projection layer if it only renames the columns without transforming them.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: - The `SELECT` clause of an outer query precisely matches the columns used in the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions of an inner query, without any column transformations or renamings.\n- The inner `SELECT` only serves as a passthrough for these columns.\n**Transformations**: - Remove the inner `SELECT` layer, directly applying the aggregate functions and `GROUP BY` to the original data source."""\n\n### Rule FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: The query contains a scalar sub-query within the WHERE clause.\n**Transformations**: The scalar sub-query should be transformed into a LEFT JOIN operation with an aggregate function on the column(s) being selected in the sub-query. The JOIN condition uses the correlation ID (the matching column(s) in both outer and sub-query).\n  - Original Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 WHERE column = (SELECT AGG_FUNCTION(column2) FROM table2 WHERE table1.join_column = table2.join_column)\n  - Transformed Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 LEFT JOIN (SELECT join_column, AGG_FUNCTION(column2) AS agg_result FROM table2 GROUP BY join_column) AS sub_query ON table1.join_column = sub_query.join_column WHERE column = sub_query.agg_result\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: The query contains `IN`, `EXISTS`, or `UNIQUE` sub-queries within the WHERE clause that are correlated with the outer query.\n**Transformations**: - For `IN` Sub-queries: Replace the `IN` clause with a JOIN operation and a WHERE condition that checks for non-null values on the side of the sub-query.\n    - Original Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 WHERE column IN (SELECT column2 FROM table2 WHERE table1.join_column = table2.join_column)\n    - Transformed Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.join_column = table2.join_column WHERE table2.column2 IS NOT NULL\n  - For `EXISTS` Sub-queries: Convert the `EXISTS` condition into a JOIN operation, using WHERE to filter rows that match the JOIN condition.\n    - Original Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM table2 WHERE table1.join_column = table2.join_class)\n    - Transformed Query Structure: SELECT DISTINCT table1.* FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.join_column = table2.join_column\n  - For `UNIQUE` Sub-queries: Since `UNIQUE` requires a bit more complex handling not directly mappable to a standard JOIN, it should be considered a special case where the goal is to ensure that rows from the outer query match a unique set in the sub-query. This might not translate directly into SQL syntax without additional sub-query or DISTINCT aggregation."""\n\n### Rule AGGREGATE_EXPAND_DISTINCT_AGGREGATES_TO_JOIN:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: If a SQL query uses strictly COUNT(DISTINCT column), SUM(DISTINCT column), MIN(DISTINCT column), or MAX(DISTINCT column) with the same column, and does not include any non-distinct aggregate functions in the SELECT clause, it can be processed without a join operator.\n**Transformations**: The SQL optimization here involves simplifying the aggregation logic to work over a single group by operation, directly translating to the use of GROUP BY on that column in SQL.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: If a SQL query contains exactly one distinct aggregate function (e.g., COUNT(DISTINCT column)) and one or more non-distinct aggregates (COUNT, SUM, MIN, MAX) on distinct or the same columns without any filters, it should be transformed as follows: 1. Generate an intermediate SQL query (bottom Aggregate) that groups by both the distinct column(s) and any columns involved in the GROUP BY clause, calculating all distinct aggregates at this stage. 2. Apply a second SQL query (top Aggregate) on top of the intermediate result to compute non-distinct aggregates. 3. If the original query contains operations that logically precede the aggregation (e.g., joins with other tables), incorporate these as necessary before the bottom Aggregate, possibly leading to a join operation. 4. Use a SELECT statement (final Project) to realign the output columns if necessary to match the original query\'s expected output.\n**Transformations**: Generate an intermediate SQL query that groups by the distinct and group by columns for distinct aggregates then apply another aggregation on this result for non-distinct aggregates. Join operational tables as necessary before aggregation\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: For SQL queries involving multiple distinct aggregate functions over different columns (e.g., COUNT(DISTINCT column_a), COUNT(DISTINCT column_b)), the transformation should proceed as follows: 1. Decompose the query into multiple parts, each part handling one of the distinct aggregates. Each part will effectively be an intermediate SQL query that performs a GROUP BY on the distinct column related to its aggregate. 2. Use JOIN operations to combine these intermediate aggregate results based on the common grouping columns that are part of the original GROUP BY clause, if present. 3. Rewrite the initial distinct aggregates in the final SELECT statement to reference the appropriate aggregated results from the combined dataset without using the DISTINCT keyword. 4. Include a final SELECT statement (Project) to ensure that the output columns are correctly named and typed to match the expected result set of the original query.\n**Transformations**: Decompose the query into parts for each distinct aggregate and GROUP BY the related distinct column. Use JOIN to combine these results based on the common group by columns. Reference the combined dataset aggregates without DISTINCT in the final SELECT to match the original expected result."""\n\nRule Subset Sequences:\n### Rule Sequence 1: ["AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE", "AGGREGATE_EXPAND_DISTINCT_AGGREGATES_TO_JOIN"]\n\n### Rule Sequence 2: ["FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE"]\n\n### Rule Sequence 3: ["FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE"]\n\n### Rule Sequence 4: ["AGGREGATE_EXPAND_DISTINCT_AGGREGATES_TO_JOIN"]\n\n### Rule Sequence 5: ["AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE"]'}], 'response': 'To optimize the given SQL query, we need to apply the provided query rewrite rules in a sequence that aligns with the suggestions and rule subset sequences.

The first strategy involves transforming the `EXISTS` and `NOT EXISTS` sub-queries into join operations. Specifically, the `EXISTS` sub-query, which checks for matching rows in the `web_sales` table with different `ws_warehouse_sk` values, is converted into an `INNER JOIN`. Similarly, the `NOT EXISTS` sub-query, which ensures no matching rows in the `web_returns` table with specific `wr_reason_sk` values, is transformed into a `LEFT JOIN` with an `IS NULL` filter to exclude such matches. These transformations can enhance performance by utilizing more efficient join operations. The second strategy suggests replacing the `NOT EXISTS` clause with a `NOT IN` or `EXCEPT` clause. This involves changing the `NOT EXISTS` sub-query to a `NOT IN` list, which can be further optimized by using `EXCEPT` if the database supports it. These strategies aim to improve query execution by leveraging more efficient set operations and join mechanisms."""\n\n### Suggestion 2:\n"""The provided SQL query can be optimized using two main rewrite strategies. The first strategy involves removing the intermediate `LogicalProject` layer by directly applying aggregate functions to the `web_sales` table, as per Case 2 of the query rewrite rule. This change optimizes the query by eliminating unnecessary projections, allowing for more efficient aggregation by directly referencing the columns from the `web_sales` table. The second strategy, based on Rule 3, suggests replacing the `DISTINCT` keyword with a `GROUP BY` clause on `ws_order_number`. This modification can potentially enhance execution efficiency by grouping the results, which may streamline the counting process and improve performance when combined with the `ORDER BY` clause. Together, these strategies aim to refine the query\'s execution plan for better performance."""\n\n### Suggestion 3:\n"""The query uses a deterministic operation `cast(\'2000-6-01\' as date) + interval \'60\' day` in the `WHERE` clause.

Each part will effectively be an intermediate SQL query that performs a GROUP BY on the distinct column related to its aggregate. 2. Use JOIN operations to combine these intermediate aggregate results based on the common grouping columns that are part of the original GROUP BY clause, if present. 3. Rewrite the initial distinct aggregates in the final SELECT statement to reference the appropriate aggregated results from the combined dataset without using the DISTINCT keyword. 4. Include a final SELECT statement (Project) to ensure that the output columns are correctly named and typed to match the expected result set of the original query.\n**Transformations**: Decompose the query into parts for each distinct aggregate and GROUP BY the related distinct column. Use JOIN to combine these results based on the common group by columns. Reference the combined dataset aggregates without DISTINCT in the final SELECT to match the original expected result."""\n\nArranged Rule Sequence: ["FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE", "AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE", "AGGREGATE_EXPAND_DISTINCT_AGGREGATES_TO_JOIN"]\n\nUtilized Rules: ["FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE", "AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE", "AGGREGATE_EXPAND_DISTINCT_AGGREGATES_TO_JOIN"]\n\nUnutilized Rules: []'}], 'response': 'Step 1: In the provided arrangement, all rules were utilized, and there are no unutilized rules.

The suggestions indicate that transforming `EXISTS` and `NOT EXISTS` sub-queries into join operations is a priority, which aligns with the "FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE" rule. The suggestion to remove intermediate projections aligns with the "AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE" rule. The suggestion to replace `DISTINCT` with `GROUP BY` aligns with the "AGGREGATE_EXPAND_DISTINCT_AGGREGATES_TO_JOIN" rule.
