Application of methods such as table pullout, duplicate weedout, first match, loose scan, and materialization.\n   - Transformation involves discarding non-matching rows in the outer query earlier, possibly by pulling relevant data into a temporary structure or scanning data in a manner that avoids processing duplicate information unnecessarily.\n   \n2. **Anti-Join Optimizations:**\n   - Utilization of explicit JOINs for negated subqueries, especially transforming `NOT IN` and `NOT EXISTS` into configurations that efficiently exclude non-matching rows.\n   - Optimization might include the use of LEFT OUTER JOIN combined with WHERE clauses that filter on NULL values from the right table of the JOIN, effectively implementing the anti-join pattern.\n   \n3. **General JOIN Optimizations:**\n   - Recommending explicit JOINs over `EXISTS` or `IN` operators to leverage database optimizations for JOIN operations, which might include better use of indexes and optimized data access paths.\n   - Optimization through the selection of appropriate JOIN types (e.g., INNER JOIN, LEFT OUTER JOIN) based on the query\'s requirements and the expected data distributions, ensuring that the execution strategy minimizes resource usage while maximizing performance.\n\nThis approach underscores a tailored execution strategy selection, prioritizing JOIN transformations that align with the query\'s specific predicates and the correlation dynamics between queries and subqueries.\n"""\nRule 2:\n"""\n**Conditions**: The SQL query utilizes traditional filtering mechanisms such as NOT EXISTS, NOT IN, EXISTS, IN, OR within JOINs and WHERE clauses.\n**Transformations**: - Replace IN with INTERSECT for querying intersecting datasets to potentially improve index usage and query speed.\n- Rewrite conditions using the OR operator into a series of UNION ALL operations to enhance code maintainability and performance.\n- Use EXCEPT instead of NOT IN or anti-joins to minimize duplicate row processing and optimize resource use, effectively reducing execution time.\n"""\nRule 3:\n"""\n**Conditions**: - The SQL query performs a `GROUP BY` operation along with other operations like `JOIN`.\n- Query performance could be enhanced by reducing the size of intermediate datasets.\n- Suitable for queries involving large datasets or attributes from Entity-Attribute-Value (EAV) tables.\n- Applicable when reordering the sequence of operations can lead to performance improvements.\n**Transformations**: - Rearrange the query to perform `GROUP BY` operations at the earliest stage, ideally before executing operations like `JOIN`.\n- Utilize subqueries for pre-aggregation to reduce the dataset size early in the execution process.\n- Directly restructure the query to prioritize grouping operations to minimize the workload on subsequent operations like `JOIN`, thereby enhancing overall execution speed and efficiency.\n"""\nRule 4:\n"""\n**Conditions**: The SQL query optimization rules apply under the following conditions:\n1. When the `LIMIT` clause is used to fetch a specified number of rows.\n2. When `ORDER BY` is used in conjunction with `LIMIT` to sort and limit the number of rows retrieved, particularly when sorting can leverage an index.\n3. When `DISTINCT` is used along with `LIMIT` to quickly identify and return unique rows without scanning the full dataset.\n4. During the use of `GROUP BY`, where optimization might involve sorting or traversing indexes in order to efficiently compute group values without processing the entire dataset.\n5. When sorting a specific number of rows from a single table based on non-indexed columns, utilizing in-memory sorting (`filesort`) techniques.\n**Transformations**: The specific SQL transformations that emerge from applying these optimization rules are:\n1. Combining `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY` encourages the database engine to stop the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained, avoiding full table sorts.\n2. Using `LIMIT` with `DISTINCT` leads to an early termination of the search for unique rows as soon as the needed amount is gathered, reducing time and resources spent on scanning the entire dataset.\n3. In the context of `GROUP BY`, optimizations may include indexing strategies or modifications to the way sorting is handled, such as employing `filesort` mechanisms that do not require temporary tables, ensuring that the database engine processes only the necessary data for group computations.\n4. Efficiencies are gained by encouraging the use of indexed columns with `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT`, making queries more efficient by reducing the cost associated with sorting and filtering operations.\n"""\nRule 5:\n"""\n**Conditions**: The rule applies when the original SQL query performs multiple scans or joins on the same table to retrieve different attributes for certain conditions, or when the query structure results in redundant data processing and complexity that could be reduced.\n**Transformations**: - Combine multiple joins into a single join operation by using `CASE` statements to conditionally select different attributes from the table in one pass. \n- Use the `COALESCE` function in conjunction with `CASE` statements to efficiently merge conditional attributes into distinct columns based on specific criteria without the need for additional joins.\n- Optimize the selection of conditional attributes by integrating `GROUP BY` with aggregate functions like `MAX` within `CASE` statements, thus condensing the result set to only the necessary data and avoiding needless retrieval and processing steps.\n- The overall transformation leads to a single, more efficient query that accomplishes the tasks of multiple, less efficient operations, improving performance, and simplifying the query for better readability and maintenance.\n"""\nRule 6:\n"""\n**Conditions**: The rule applies when there is a use of `IN` or `=ANY` comparison involving a subquery. It is also applicable for scenarios dealing with composite keys or multiple columns, and there is a consideration for handling `NULL` values in subqueries to maintain logical integrity.\n**Transformations**: 1. Convert `outer_expr IN (SELECT inner_expr FROM ... WHERE subquery_where)` into an equivalent `EXISTS` query, adding an `AND outer_expr=inner_expr` condition within the subquery\'s `WHERE` clause. This narrows down the rows the database needs to evaluate.\n2. For composite keys or conditions involving multiple columns, expand the added equality condition to include comparisons for all relevant columns, i.e., `AND outer_col1=inner_col1 AND outer_col2=inner_col2 AND ...`.\n3. Include conditions to handle `NULL` values appropriately, ensuring the query accounts for scenarios where `inner_expr` might be `NULL`. This can involve adding conditions like `OR inner_expr IS NULL` within the subquery to ensure the integrity and completeness of the logic.\n"""'}], 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'stream': False, 'temperature': 0.1}}

The filter's expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there's a matching row in the non-preserving side's table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned.\n```\n\nLogical Plan Changes After Rewrite: ```\n  LogicalSort(sort0=[$0(i_item_id)], sort1=[$1(c_birth_year)], sort2=[$2(ss_ext_sales_price)], dir0=[ASC], dir1=[ASC], dir2=[ASC], fetch=[100])\r\n    LogicalProject(item_id=[$0(i_item_id)], birth_year=[$1(c_birth_year)], ss_item_rev=[$2(ss_ext_sales_price)], ss_dev=[*(/($2(ss_ext_sales_price), /(+(+($2(ss_ext_sales_price), $5(cs_ext_sales_price)), $8(ws_ext_sales_price)), 3)), 100)], cs_item_rev=[$5(cs_ext_sales_price)], cs_dev=[*(/($5(cs_ext_sales_price), /(+(+($2(ss_ext_sales_price), $5(cs_ext_sales_price)), $8(ws_ext_sales_price)), 3)), 100)], ws_item_rev=[$8(ws_ext_sales_price)], ws_dev=[*(/($8(ws_ext_sales_price), /(+(+($2(ss_ext_sales_price), $5(cs_ext_sales_price)), $8(ws_ext_sales_price)), 3)), 100)], average=[/(+(+($2(ss_ext_sales_price), $5(cs_ext_sales_price)), $8(ws_ext_sales_price)), 3)])\r\n+     LogicalJoin(condition=[AND(=($0(i_item_id), $6(i_item_id)), =($1(c_birth_year), $7(c_birth_year)), >=($2(ss_ext_sales_price), *(0.9:DECIMAL(2, 1), $8(ws_ext_sales_price))), <=($2(ss_ext_sales_price), *(1.1:DECIMAL(2, 1), $8(ws_ext_sales_price))), >=($5(cs_ext_sales_price), *(0.9:DECIMAL(2, 1), $8(ws_ext_sales_price))), <=($5(cs_ext_sales_price), *(1.1:DECIMAL(2, 1), $8(ws_ext_sales_price))), >=($8(ws_ext_sales_price), *(0.9:DECIMAL(2, 1), $2(ss_ext_sales_price))), <=($8(ws_ext_sales_price), *(1.1:DECIMAL(2, 1), $2(ss_ext_sales_price))), >=($8(ws_ext_sales_price), *(0.9:DECIMAL(2, 1), $5(cs_ext_sales_price))), <=($8(ws_ext_sales_price), *(1.1:DECIMAL(2, 1), $5(cs_ext_sales_price))))], joinType=[inner])\r\n+       LogicalJoin(condition=[AND(=($0(i_item_id), $3(i_item_id)), =($1(c_birth_year), $4(c_birth_year)), >=($2(ss_ext_sales_price), *(0.9:DECIMAL(2, 1), $5(cs_ext_sales_price))), <=($2(ss_ext_sales_price), *(1.1:DECIMAL(2, 1), $5(cs_ext_sales_price))), >=($5(cs_ext_sales_price), *(0.9:DECIMAL(2, 1), $2(ss_ext_sales_price))), <=($5(cs_ext_sales_price), *(1.1:DECIMAL(2, 1), $2(ss_ext_sales_price))))], joinType=[inner])\r\n-     LogicalFilter(condition=[AND(=($0(i_item_id), $3(i_item_id)), =($0(i_item_id), $6(i_item_id)), =($1(c_birth_year), $4(c_birth_year)), =($1(c_birth_year), $7(c_birth_year)), >=($2(ss_ext_sales_price), *(0.9:DECIMAL(2, 1), $5(cs_ext_sales_price))), <=($2(ss_ext_sales_price), *(1.1:DECIMAL(2, 1), $5(cs_ext_sales_price))), >=($2(ss_ext_sales_price), *(0.9:DECIMAL(2, 1), $8(ws_ext_sales_price))), <=($2(ss_ext_sales_price), *(1.1:DECIMAL(2, 1), $8(ws_ext_sales_price))), >=($5(cs_ext_sales_price), *(0.9:DECIMAL(2, 1), $2(ss_ext_sales_price))), <=($5(cs_ext_sales_price), *(1.1:DECIMAL(2, 1), $2(ss_ext_sales_price))), >=($5(cs_ext_sales_price), *(0.9:DECIMAL(2, 1), $8(ws_ext_sales_price))), <=($5(cs_ext_sales_price), *(1.1:DECIMAL(2, 1), $8(ws_ext_sales_price))), >=($8(ws_ext_sales_price), *(0.9:DECIMAL(2, 1), $2(ss_ext_sales_price))), <=($8(ws_ext_sales_price), *(1.1:DECIMAL(2, 1), $2(ss_ext_sales_price))), >=($8(ws_ext_sales_price), *(0.9:DECIMAL(2, 1), $5(cs_ext_sales_price))), <=($8(ws_ext_sales_price), *(1.1:DECIMAL(2, 1), $5(cs_ext_sales_price))))])\r\n-       LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n-         LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n-           LogicalAggregate(group=[{0, 1}], ss_item_rev=[SUM($2)])\r\n?

Rule: ```\nCase 1:\n**Conditions**: - The SQL query contains a `GROUP BY` clause that groups by simple columns (no expressions in the `GROUP BY` list).\n- The aggregate functions in the `SELECT` clause operate directly on columns (no expressions inside the aggregate functions).\n- The `SELECT` clause only contains the columns used in the `GROUP BY` clause and the aggregates without any transformations or additional expressions.\n**Transformations**: - Directly apply the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions to the data source referred to in the `FROM` clause of the inner query before the projection.\n- Eliminate the outer projection layer if it only renames the columns without transforming them.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: - The `SELECT` clause of an outer query precisely matches the columns used in the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions of an inner query, without any column transformations or renamings.\n- The inner `SELECT` only serves as a passthrough for these columns.\n**Transformations**: - Remove the inner `SELECT` layer, directly applying the aggregate functions and `GROUP BY` to the original data source.\n```\n\nLogical Plan Changes After Rewrite:

The filter's expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there's a matching row in the non-preserving side's table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned.\n```\n\nLogical Plan Changes After Rewrite: ```\n  LogicalSort(sort0=[$0(i_item_id)], sort1=[$1(c_birth_year)], sort2=[$2(ss_ext_sales_price)], dir0=[ASC], dir1=[ASC], dir2=[ASC], fetch=[100])\r\n    LogicalProject(item_id=[$0(i_item_id)], birth_year=[$1(c_birth_year)], ss_item_rev=[$2(ss_ext_sales_price)], ss_dev=[*(/($2(ss_ext_sales_price), /(+(+($2(ss_ext_sales_price), $5(cs_ext_sales_price)), $8(ws_ext_sales_price)), 3)), 100)], cs_item_rev=[$5(cs_ext_sales_price)], cs_dev=[*(/($5(cs_ext_sales_price), /(+(+($2(ss_ext_sales_price), $5(cs_ext_sales_price)), $8(ws_ext_sales_price)), 3)), 100)], ws_item_rev=[$8(ws_ext_sales_price)], ws_dev=[*(/($8(ws_ext_sales_price), /(+(+($2(ss_ext_sales_price), $5(cs_ext_sales_price)), $8(ws_ext_sales_price)), 3)), 100)], average=[/(+(+($2(ss_ext_sales_price), $5(cs_ext_sales_price)), $8(ws_ext_sales_price)), 3)])\r\n+     LogicalJoin(condition=[AND(=($0(i_item_id), $6(i_item_id)), =($1(c_birth_year), $7(c_birth_year)), >=($2(ss_ext_sales_price), *(0.9:DECIMAL(2, 1), $8(ws_ext_sales_price))), <=($2(ss_ext_sales_price), *(1.1:DECIMAL(2, 1), $8(ws_ext_sales_price))), >=($5(cs_ext_sales_price), *(0.9:DECIMAL(2, 1), $8(ws_ext_sales_price))), <=($5(cs_ext_sales_price), *(1.1:DECIMAL(2, 1), $8(ws_ext_sales_price))), >=($8(ws_ext_sales_price), *(0.9:DECIMAL(2, 1), $2(ss_ext_sales_price))), <=($8(ws_ext_sales_price), *(1.1:DECIMAL(2, 1), $2(ss_ext_sales_price))), >=($8(ws_ext_sales_price), *(0.9:DECIMAL(2, 1), $5(cs_ext_sales_price))), <=($8(ws_ext_sales_price), *(1.1:DECIMAL(2, 1), $5(cs_ext_sales_price))))], joinType=[inner])\r\n+       LogicalJoin(condition=[AND(=($0(i_item_id), $3(i_item_id)), =($1(c_birth_year), $4(c_birth_year)), >=($2(ss_ext_sales_price), *(0.9:DECIMAL(2, 1), $5(cs_ext_sales_price))), <=($2(ss_ext_sales_price), *(1.1:DECIMAL(2, 1), $5(cs_ext_sales_price))), >=($5(cs_ext_sales_price), *(0.9:DECIMAL(2, 1), $2(ss_ext_sales_price))), <=($5(cs_ext_sales_price), *(1.1:DECIMAL(2, 1), $2(ss_ext_sales_price))))], joinType=[inner])\r\n-     LogicalFilter(condition=[AND(=($0(i_item_id), $3(i_item_id)), =($0(i_item_id), $6(i_item_id)), =($1(c_birth_year), $4(c_birth_year)), =($1(c_birth_year), $7(c_birth_year)), >=($2(ss_ext_sales_price), *(0.9:DECIMAL(2, 1), $5(cs_ext_sales_price))), <=($2(ss_ext_sales_price), *(1.1:DECIMAL(2, 1), $5(cs_ext_sales_price))), >=($2(ss_ext_sales_price), *(0.9:DECIMAL(2, 1), $8(ws_ext_sales_price))), <=($2(ss_ext_sales_price), *(1.1:DECIMAL(2, 1), $8(ws_ext_sales_price))), >=($5(cs_ext_sales_price), *(0.9:DECIMAL(2, 1), $2(ss_ext_sales_price))), <=($5(cs_ext_sales_price), *(1.1:DECIMAL(2, 1), $2(ss_ext_sales_price))), >=($5(cs_ext_sales_price), *(0.9:DECIMAL(2, 1), $8(ws_ext_sales_price))), <=($5(cs_ext_sales_price), *(1.1:DECIMAL(2, 1), $8(ws_ext_sales_price))), >=($8(ws_ext_sales_price), *(0.9:DECIMAL(2, 1), $2(ss_ext_sales_price))), <=($8(ws_ext_sales_price), *(1.1:DECIMAL(2, 1), $2(ss_ext_sales_price))), >=($8(ws_ext_sales_price), *(0.9:DECIMAL(2, 1), $5(cs_ext_sales_price))), <=($8(ws_ext_sales_price), *(1.1:DECIMAL(2, 1), $5(cs_ext_sales_price))))])\r\n-       LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n-         LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n-           LogicalAggregate(group=[{0, 1}], ss_item_rev=[SUM($2)])\r\n?

Specifically, the conditions that were originally applied after the joins in the `WHERE` clause have been pushed down into the `ON` clause of the `INNER JOIN` operations. This is evident from the removal of the `LogicalFilter` node and the addition of conditions to the `LogicalJoin` nodes.\n\nStep 2: Parsing the logical plan changes, we observe that the original SQL query had a `WHERE` clause with multiple conditions applied after the joins between `ss_items`, `cs_items`, and `ws_items`. These conditions involved comparisons between `ss_item_rev`, `cs_item_rev`, and `ws_item_rev` columns. In the rewritten query, these conditions have been incorporated into the `ON` clause of the `INNER JOIN` operations, effectively reducing the dataset size before the join occurs.\n\nStep 3: The query rewrite rule contains multiple cases. In this scenario, the conditions from the `WHERE` clause that only involve columns from one side of the join (e.g., `ss_item_rev`, `cs_item_rev`, `ws_item_rev`) have been moved into the `ON` clause of the `INNER JOIN`. This matches Case 1 of the query rewrite rule, where filter conditions that can be logically associated with columns from one side of the join are moved into the `ON` clause.\n\nStep 4: The SQL query changes can be explained by Case 1 of the query rewrite rule. The original query had a `WHERE` clause with conditions such as `ss_item_rev between 0.9 * cs_item_rev and 1.1 * cs_item_rev`, which only involved columns from the `ss_items`, `cs_items`, and `ws_items` tables. These conditions were moved into the `ON` clause of the `INNER JOIN` operations, as they only reference columns from the joined tables and do not involve columns from both sides of the join. This transformation optimizes the query by reducing the size of the datasets before the join, improving query performance.', 'time': 4.381591796875}

You should cite the detailed changes of the given SQL query to explain this query rewrite process concisely and detailedly.\n\nOutput in the following format:\nStep 1: <step 1 reasoning>\nStep 2: <step 2 reasoning>\nStep 3: <step 3 reasoning>\nStep 4: <step 4 reasoning>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': "\nSQL Query: ```sql\nwith ss_items as\n (select i_item_id item_id\n       ,c_birth_year birth_year\n        ,sum(ss_ext_sales_price) ss_item_rev\n from store_sales\n     ,item\n     ,date_dim\n     ,customer\n where ss_item_sk = i_item_sk\n   and d_date in (select d_date\n                  from date_dim\n                  where d_month_seq = (select d_month_seq\n                                      from date_dim\n                                      where d_date = '2000-01-02'))\n   and ss_sold_date_sk   = d_date_sk\n   and ss_list_price between 95 and 124\n   and i_manager_id BETWEEN 7 and 36\n   and ss_customer_sk = c_customer_sk\n   and c_birth_year BETWEEN 1934 AND 1940\ngroup by i_item_id, c_birth_year),\n cs_items as\n (select i_item_id item_id\n        ,c_birth_year birth_year\n        ,sum(cs_ext_sales_price) cs_item_rev\n  from catalog_sales\n      ,item\n      ,date_dim\n      ,customer\n where cs_item_sk = i_item_sk\n  and  d_date in (select d_date\n                  from date_dim\n                  where d_month_seq = (select d_month_seq\n                                      from date_dim\n                                      where d_date = '2000-01-02'))\n  and  cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk\n  and  cs_list_price between 95 and 124\n  and i_manager_id BETWEEN 7 and 36\n  and cs_bill_customer_sk = c_customer_sk\n  and c_birth_year BETWEEN 1934 AND 1940\ngroup by i_item_id, c_birth_year),\n ws_items as\n (select i_item_id item_id\n      ,c_birth_year birth_year\n        ,sum(ws_ext_sales_price) ws_item_rev\n  from web_sales\n      ,item\n      ,date_dim\n      ,customer\n where ws_item_sk = i_item_sk\n  and  d_date in (select d_date\n                  from date_dim\n                  where d_month_seq = (select d_month_seq\n                                     from date_dim\n                                     where d_date = '2000-01-02'))\n  and ws_sold_date_sk   = d_date_sk\n  and ws_list_price between 95 and 124\n  and i_manager_id BETWEEN 7 and 36\n  and ws_bill_customer_sk = c_customer_sk\n  and c_birth_year BETWEEN 1934 AND 1940\ngroup by i_item_id, c_birth_year)\n  select  ss_items.item_id, ss_items.birth_year\n       ,ss_item_rev\n       ,ss_item_rev/((ss_item_rev+cs_item_rev+ws_item_rev)/3) * 100 ss_dev\n       ,cs_item_rev\n       ,cs_item_rev/((ss_item_rev+cs_item_rev+ws_item_rev)/3) * 100 cs_dev\n       ,ws_item_rev\n       ,ws_item_rev/((ss_item_rev+cs_item_rev+ws_item_rev)/3) * 100 ws_dev\n       ,(ss_item_rev+cs_item_rev+ws_item_rev)/3 average\n from ss_items,cs_items,ws_items\n where ss_items.item_id=cs_items.item_id\n   and ss_items.item_id=ws_items.item_id\n   and ss_items.birth_year = cs_items.birth_year\n   and ss_items.birth_year = ws_items.birth_year\n   and ss_item_rev between 0.9 * cs_item_rev and 1.1 * cs_item_rev\n   and ss_item_rev between 0.9 * ws_item_rev and 1.1 * ws_item_rev\n   and cs_item_rev between 0.9 * ss_item_rev and 1.1 * ss_item_rev\n   and cs_item_rev between 0.9 * ws_item_rev and 1.1 * ws_item_rev\n   and ws_item_rev between 0.9 * ss_item_rev and 1.1 * ss_item_rev\n   and ws_item_rev between 0.9 * cs_item_rev and 1.1 * cs_item_rev\n order by item_id, birth_year\n         ,ss_item_rev\n limit 100;\n```\n\nQuery Rewrite Rule: ```\nCase 1:\n**Conditions**: The query contains a scalar sub-query within the WHERE clause.\n**Transformations**: The scalar sub-query should be transformed into a LEFT JOIN operation with an aggregate function on the column(s) being selected in the sub-query. The JOIN condition uses the correlation ID (the matching column(s) in both outer and sub-query).\n  - Original Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 WHERE column = (SELECT AGG_FUNCTION(column2) FROM table2 WHERE table1.join_column = table2.join_column)\n  - Transformed Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 LEFT JOIN (SELECT join_column, AGG_FUNCTION(column2) AS agg_result FROM table2 GROUP BY join_column) AS sub_query ON table1.join_column = sub_query.join_column WHERE column = sub_query.agg_result\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: The query contains `IN`, `EXISTS`, or `UNIQUE` sub-queries within the WHERE clause that are correlated with the outer query.\n**Transformations**: - For `IN` Sub-queries: Replace the `IN` clause with a JOIN operation and a WHERE condition that checks for non-null values on the side of the sub-query.\n    - Original Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 WHERE column IN (SELECT column2 FROM table2 WHERE table1.join_column = table2.join_column)\n    - Transformed Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.join_column = table2.join_column WHERE table2.column2 IS NOT NULL\n  - For `EXISTS` Sub-queries: Convert the `EXISTS` condition into a JOIN operation, using WHERE to filter rows that match the JOIN condition.\n    - Original Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM table2 WHERE table1.join_column = table2.join_class)\n    - Transformed Query Structure: SELECT DISTINCT table1.* FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.join_column = table2.join_column\n  - For `UNIQUE` Sub-queries: Since `UNIQUE` requires a bit more complex handling not directly mappable to a standard JOIN, it should be considered a special case where the goal is to ensure that rows from the outer query match a unique set in the sub-query. This might not translate directly into SQL syntax without additional sub-query or DISTINCT aggregation.\n```\n\nLogical Plan Changes After Rewrite: ```\n  LogicalSort(sort0=[$0(i_item_id)],

logical plan changes after the rewrite show that the primary transformation involves the simplification of range conditions in the WHERE clause of the SQL query. Specifically, the conditions involving BETWEEN clauses for `ss_list_price`, `i_manager_id`, and `c_birth_year` have been replaced with SEARCH expressions that use Sargable (SEARCH ARGument ABLE) predicates. This indicates that the query rewrite rule has optimized these conditions for better performance.\n\nStep 2: Parsing the logical plan changes, we observe the following detailed changes in the SQL query:\n- The conditions `ss_list_price BETWEEN 95 AND 124`, `i_manager_id BETWEEN 7 AND 36`, and `c_birth_year BETWEEN 1934 AND 1940` in the `ss_items`, `cs_items`, and `ws_items` subqueries have been transformed into `SEARCH` predicates: `SEARCH($12(ss_list_price), Sarg[[95..124]])`, `SEARCH($43(i_manager_id), Sarg[[7..36]])`, and `SEARCH($86(c_birth_year), Sarg[[1934..1940]])`, respectively.\n- Similar transformations are applied to the `cs_items` and `ws_items` subqueries for the corresponding columns.\n\nStep 3: The query rewrite rule contains multiple cases. In this scenario, the changes match Case 3 of the query rewrite rule. Case 3 involves simplifying complex conditions based on known constraints or logical simplification. The transformation of BETWEEN clauses into SEARCH predicates is a form of logical simplification that optimizes the query execution plan by making the conditions more efficient for the database engine to process.\n\nStep 4: The SQL query changes can be explained as follows: The original query contained BETWEEN conditions that specified ranges for `ss_list_price`, `i_manager_id`, and `c_birth_year`. These conditions were simplified using the SEARCH predicate, which is a more efficient way to express range queries in SQL. This transformation aligns with Case 3 of the query rewrite rule, which aims to simplify conditions based on logical rules and known constraints.

transformations or additional expressions.\n**Transformations**: - Directly apply the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions to the data source referred to in the `FROM` clause of the inner query before the projection.\n- Eliminate the outer projection layer if it only renames the columns without transforming them.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: - The `SELECT` clause of an outer query precisely matches the columns used in the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions of an inner query, without any column transformations or renamings.\n- The inner `SELECT` only serves as a passthrough for these

logical plan changes indicate that the query rewrite rule has removed the `LogicalProject` nodes that were previously projecting columns after aggregation. The `LogicalAggregate` nodes now directly aggregate data from the `LogicalFilter` nodes, which are directly connected to the `LogicalJoin` nodes. This suggests that the query rewrite rule has eliminated unnecessary projection layers and directly applied aggregation to the data sources.\n\nStep 2: Parsing the logical plan changes, we observe that the `LogicalProject` nodes, which were previously renaming columns (e.g., `item_id`, `birth_year`, `ss_ext_sales_price`), have been removed. The `LogicalAggregate` nodes now directly use the columns from the `LogicalFilter` nodes, which are connected to the `LogicalJoin` nodes. The `LogicalJoin` nodes are directly connected to the `LogicalTableScan` nodes for the tables `store_sales`, `item`, `date_dim`, and `customer`. This indicates that the query rewrite rule has simplified the query by removing intermediate projections and directly applying aggregation to the joined tables.\n\nStep 3: The query rewrite rule contains two cases. Case 1 involves simplifying queries with `GROUP BY` clauses and direct aggregate functions, while Case 2 involves removing inner `SELECT` layers when the outer query matches the inner query's `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions. The parsed SQL query changes match Case 2, as the inner `SELECT` layers have been removed, and the aggregation is directly applied to the original data sources.\n\nStep 4: The SQL query changes can be explained by Case 2 of the query rewrite rule. The original query had inner `SELECT` layers within the common table expressions (`ss_items`, `cs_items`, `ws_items`) that served as passthroughs for the columns used in the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions. The rewrite rule identified that these inner `SELECT` layers were unnecessary and removed them, allowing the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions to be directly applied to the data sources (`store_sales`, `catalog_sales`, `web_sales`, `item`, `date_dim`, `customer`). This simplification reduces the complexity of the query and improves performance by eliminating redundant projections and directly aggregating data from the joined tables.", 'time': 5.291760444641113}

Application of methods such as table pullout, duplicate weedout, first match, loose scan, and materialization.\n   - Transformation involves discarding non-matching rows in the outer query earlier, possibly by pulling relevant data into a temporary structure or scanning data in a manner that avoids processing duplicate information unnecessarily.\n   \n2. **Anti-Join Optimizations:**\n   - Utilization of explicit JOINs for negated subqueries, especially transforming `NOT IN` and `NOT EXISTS` into configurations that efficiently exclude non-matching rows.\n   - Optimization might include the use of LEFT OUTER JOIN combined with WHERE clauses that filter on NULL values from the right table of the JOIN, effectively implementing the anti-join pattern.\n   \n3. **General JOIN Optimizations:**\n   - Recommending explicit JOINs over `EXISTS` or `IN` operators to leverage database optimizations for JOIN operations, which might include better use of indexes and optimized data access paths.\n   - Optimization through the selection of appropriate JOIN types (e.g., INNER JOIN, LEFT OUTER JOIN) based on the query\'s requirements and the expected data distributions, ensuring that the execution strategy minimizes resource usage while maximizing performance.\n\nThis approach underscores a tailored execution strategy selection, prioritizing JOIN transformations that align with the query\'s specific predicates and the correlation dynamics between queries and subqueries.\n"""\nRule 2:\n"""\n**Conditions**: The SQL query utilizes traditional filtering mechanisms such as NOT EXISTS, NOT IN, EXISTS, IN, OR within JOINs and WHERE clauses.\n**Transformations**: -

You should cite the detailed changes of the given SQL query to explain this query rewrite process concisely and detailedly.\n\nOutput in the following format:\nStep 1: <step 1 reasoning>\nStep 2: <step 2 reasoning>\nStep 3: <step 3 reasoning>\nStep 4: <step 4 reasoning>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': "\nSQL Query: ```sql\nwith ss_items as\n (select i_item_id item_id\n       ,c_birth_year birth_year\n        ,sum(ss_ext_sales_price) ss_item_rev\n from store_sales\n     ,item\n     ,date_dim\n     ,customer\n where ss_item_sk = i_item_sk\n   and d_date in (select d_date\n                  from date_dim\n                  where d_month_seq = (select d_month_seq\n                                      from date_dim\n                                      where d_date = '2000-01-02'))\n   and ss_sold_date_sk   = d_date_sk\n   and ss_list_price between 95 and 124\n   and i_manager_id BETWEEN 7 and 36\n   and ss_customer_sk = c_customer_sk\n   and c_birth_year BETWEEN 1934 AND 1940\ngroup by i_item_id, c_birth_year),\n cs_items as\n (select i_item_id item_id\n        ,c_birth_year birth_year\n        ,sum(cs_ext_sales_price) cs_item_rev\n  from catalog_sales\n      ,item\n      ,date_dim\n      ,customer\n where cs_item_sk = i_item_sk\n  and  d_date in (select d_date\n                  from date_dim\n                  where d_month_seq = (select d_month_seq\n                                      from date_dim\n                                      where d_date = '2000-01-02'))\n  and  cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk\n  and  cs_list_price between 95 and 124\n  and i_manager_id BETWEEN 7 and 36\n  and cs_bill_customer_sk = c_customer_sk\n  and c_birth_year BETWEEN 1934 AND 1940\ngroup by i_item_id, c_birth_year),\n ws_items as\n (select i_item_id item_id\n      ,c_birth_year birth_year\n        ,sum(ws_ext_sales_price) ws_item_rev\n  from web_sales\n      ,item\n      ,date_dim\n      ,customer\n where ws_item_sk = i_item_sk\n  and  d_date in (select d_date\n                  from date_dim\n                  where d_month_seq = (select d_month_seq\n                                     from date_dim\n                                     where d_date = '2000-01-02'))\n  and ws_sold_date_sk   = d_date_sk\n  and ws_list_price between 95 and 124\n  and i_manager_id BETWEEN 7 and 36\n  and ws_bill_customer_sk = c_customer_sk\n  and c_birth_year BETWEEN 1934 AND 1940\ngroup by i_item_id, c_birth_year)\n  select  ss_items.item_id, ss_items.birth_year\n       ,ss_item_rev\n       ,ss_item_rev/((ss_item_rev+cs_item_rev+ws_item_rev)/3) * 100 ss_dev\n       ,cs_item_rev\n       ,cs_item_rev/((ss_item_rev+cs_item_rev+ws_item_rev)/3) * 100 cs_dev\n       ,ws_item_rev\n       ,ws_item_rev/((ss_item_rev+cs_item_rev+ws_item_rev)/3) * 100 ws_dev\n       ,(ss_item_rev+cs_item_rev+ws_item_rev)/3 average\n from ss_items,cs_items,ws_items\n where ss_items.item_id=cs_items.item_id\n   and ss_items.item_id=ws_items.item_id\n   and ss_items.birth_year = cs_items.birth_year\n   and ss_items.birth_year = ws_items.birth_year\n   and ss_item_rev between 0.9 * cs_item_rev and 1.1 * cs_item_rev\n   and ss_item_rev between 0.9 * ws_item_rev and 1.1 * ws_item_rev\n   and cs_item_rev between 0.9 * ss_item_rev and 1.1 * ss_item_rev\n   and cs_item_rev between 0.9 * ws_item_rev and 1.1 * ws_item_rev\n   and ws_item_rev between 0.9 * ss_item_rev and 1.1 * ss_item_rev\n   and ws_item_rev between 0.9 * cs_item_rev and 1.1 * cs_item_rev\n order by item_id, birth_year\n         ,ss_item_rev\n limit 100;\n```\n\nQuery Rewrite Rule: ```\nCase 1:\n**Conditions**: The query contains a scalar sub-query within the WHERE clause.\n**Transformations**: The scalar sub-query should be transformed into a LEFT JOIN operation with an aggregate function on the column(s) being selected in the sub-query. The JOIN condition uses the correlation ID (the matching column(s) in both outer and sub-query).\n  - Original Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 WHERE column = (SELECT AGG_FUNCTION(column2) FROM table2 WHERE table1.join_column = table2.join_column)\n  - Transformed Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 LEFT JOIN (SELECT join_column, AGG_FUNCTION(column2) AS agg_result FROM table2 GROUP BY join_column) AS sub_query ON table1.join_column = sub_query.join_column WHERE column = sub_query.agg_result\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: The query contains `IN`, `EXISTS`, or `UNIQUE` sub-queries within the WHERE clause that are correlated with the outer query.\n**Transformations**: - For `IN` Sub-queries: Replace the `IN` clause with a JOIN operation and a WHERE condition that checks for non-null values on the side of the sub-query.\n    - Original Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 WHERE column IN (SELECT column2 FROM table2 WHERE table1.join_column = table2.join_column)\n    - Transformed Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.join_column = table2.join_column WHERE table2.column2 IS NOT NULL\n  - For `EXISTS` Sub-queries: Convert the `EXISTS` condition into a JOIN operation, using WHERE to filter rows that match the JOIN condition.\n    - Original Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM table2 WHERE table1.join_column = table2.join_class)\n    - Transformed Query Structure: SELECT DISTINCT table1.* FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.join_column = table2.join_column\n  - For `UNIQUE` Sub-queries: Since `UNIQUE` requires a bit more complex handling not directly mappable to a standard JOIN, it should be considered a special case where the goal is to ensure that rows from the outer query match a unique set in the sub-query. This might not translate directly into SQL syntax without additional sub-query or DISTINCT aggregation.\n```\n\nLogical Plan Changes After Rewrite: ```\n  LogicalSort(sort0=[$0(i_item_id)],

conditions, have been transformed into `JOIN` operations. Specifically, the sub-queries that checked for dates within a specific month sequence have been replaced by `LEFT JOIN` operations with an aggregate function.\n\nStep 2: Parsing the logical plan changes, we see that the original sub-query structure:\n```sql\nd_date in (select d_date\n           from date_dim\n           where d_month_seq = (select d_month_seq\n                                from date_dim\n                                where d_date = '2000-01-02'))\n```\nhas been transformed into a `LEFT JOIN` with an aggregate function:\n```sql\nLEFT JOIN (SELECT d_month_seq, SINGLE_VALUE(d_date) AS d_date\n           FROM date_dim\n           WHERE d_date = '2000-01-02'\n           GROUP BY d_month_seq) AS sub_query\nON date_dim.d_month_seq = sub_query.d_month_seq\n```\nThis transformation replaces the `IN` clause with a `JOIN` operation and uses an aggregate function to ensure a single value is selected.\n\nStep 3: The query rewrite rule contains multiple cases. The parsed SQL query changes match Case 2 of the query rewrite rule, which deals with `IN` sub-queries. The transformation involves replacing the `IN` clause with a `JOIN` operation and a `WHERE` condition that checks for non-null values on the side of the sub-query.\n\nStep 4: The SQL query changes can be explained as follows: The original query used an `IN` sub-query to filter dates based on a specific month sequence derived from another sub-query. This was transformed into a `LEFT JOIN` operation with an aggregate function (`SINGLE_VALUE`) to ensure that the sub-query returns a single value for the join condition. The `JOIN` operation is performed on the `d_month_seq` column, which correlates the outer query with the sub-query. This transformation optimizes the query by leveraging joins and aggregates instead of nested sub-queries, which can improve performance and readability.", 'time': 4.46534538269043}
05:38:18,213 root INFO Generated queries:
Query 1: The SQL query changes can be explained by Case 1 of the query rewrite rule. The original query had a `WHERE` clause with conditions such as `ss_item_rev between 0.9 * cs_item_rev and 1.1 * cs_item_rev`, which only involved columns from the `ss_items`, `cs_items`, and `ws_items` tables. These conditions were moved into the `ON` clause of the `INNER JOIN` operations, as they only reference columns from the joined tables and do not involve columns from both sides of the join. This transformation optimizes the query by reducing the size of the datasets before the join, improving query performance.
Query 2: The SQL query changes can be explained by Case 2 of the query rewrite rule. The original query had inner `SELECT` layers within the common table expressions (`ss_items`, `cs_items`, `ws_items`) that served as passthroughs for the columns used in the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions. The rewrite rule identified that these inner `SELECT` layers were unnecessary and removed them, allowing the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions to be directly applied to the data sources (`store_sales`, `catalog_sales`, `web_sales`, `item`, `date_dim`, `customer`). This simplification reduces the complexity of the query and improves performance by eliminating redundant projections and directly aggregating data from the joined tables.
Query 3: The SQL query changes can be explained as follows: The original query contained BETWEEN conditions that specified ranges for `ss_list_price`, `i_manager_id`, and `c_birth_year`. These conditions were simplified using the SEARCH predicate, which is a more efficient way to express range queries in SQL. This transformation aligns with Case 3 of the query rewrite rule, which aims to simplify conditions based on logical rules and known constraints. By converting the BETWEEN conditions into SEARCH predicates, the query becomes more efficient, potentially improving performance by allowing the database engine to better utilize indexes and optimize the execution plan.
Query 4: The SQL query changes can be explained as follows: The original query used an `IN` sub-query to filter dates based on a specific month sequence derived from another sub-query. This was transformed into a `LEFT JOIN` operation with an aggregate function (`SINGLE_VALUE`) to ensure that the sub-query returns a single value for the join condition. The `JOIN` operation is performed on the `d_month_seq` column, which correlates the outer query with the sub-query. This transformation optimizes the query by leveraging joins and aggregates instead of nested sub-queries, which can improve performance and readability.
Query 5: The query contains subqueries with `IN` predicates in the `WHERE` clause of the CTEs (`ss_items`, `cs_items`, `ws_items`). These subqueries can be optimized using semi-join techniques. For example, the subquery `d_date in (select d_date from date_dim where d_month_seq = (select d_month_seq from date_dim where d_date = '2000-01-02'))` can be transformed into a semi-join by pulling the relevant data into a temporary structure or scanning data in a manner that avoids processing duplicate information unnecessarily. This transformation reduces the result set size early in query processing, improving performance by discarding non-matching rows sooner.
Query 6: The query performs `GROUP BY` operations in each CTE before joining them in the main query. To optimize performance, the `GROUP BY` operations can be rearranged to occur at the earliest stage possible. This involves ensuring that the aggregation is done before any joins, reducing the size of intermediate datasets. By pre-aggregating data in subqueries, the workload on subsequent join operations is minimized, enhancing overall execution speed and efficiency.
Query 7: The query uses `LIMIT` and `ORDER BY`, which can be optimized by ensuring that the database engine stops the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained. This avoids full table sorts and reduces resource usage. The current query already leverages these optimizations by combining `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY`, ensuring efficient retrieval of the top 100 rows based on the specified order criteria.

"""The SQL query changes can be explained by Case 1 of the query rewrite rule. The original query had a `WHERE` clause with conditions such as `ss_item_rev between 0.9 * cs_item_rev and 1.1 * cs_item_rev`, which only involved columns from the `ss_items`, `cs_items`, and `ws_items` tables. These conditions were moved into the `ON` clause of the `INNER JOIN` operations, as they only reference columns from the joined tables and do not involve columns from both sides of the join. This transformation optimizes the query by reducing the size of the datasets before the join, improving query performance."""

Query Rewrite 2:
"""The SQL query changes can be explained by Case 2 of the query rewrite rule. The original query had inner `SELECT` layers within the common table expressions (`ss_items`, `cs_items`, `ws_items`) that served as passthroughs for the columns used in the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions. The rewrite rule identified that these inner `SELECT` layers were unnecessary and removed them, allowing the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions to be directly applied to the data sources (`store_sales`, `catalog_sales`, `web_sales`, `item`, `date_dim`, `customer`). This simplification reduces the complexity of the query and improves performance by eliminating redundant projections and directly aggregating data from the joined tables."""

Query Rewrite 3:
"""The SQL query changes can be explained as follows: The original query contained BETWEEN conditions that specified ranges for `ss_list_price`, `i_manager_id`, and `c_birth_year`. These conditions were simplified using the SEARCH predicate, which is a more efficient way to express range queries in SQL. This transformation aligns with Case 3 of the query rewrite rule, which aims to simplify conditions based on logical rules and known constraints. By converting the BETWEEN conditions into SEARCH predicates, the query becomes more efficient, potentially improving performance by allowing the database engine to better utilize indexes and optimize the execution plan."""

Query Rewrite 4:
"""The SQL query changes can be explained as follows: The original query used an `IN` sub-query to filter dates based on a specific month sequence derived from another sub-query. This was transformed into a `LEFT JOIN` operation with an aggregate function (`SINGLE_VALUE`) to ensure that the sub-query returns a single value for the join condition. The `JOIN` operation is performed on the `d_month_seq` column, which correlates the outer query with the sub-query. This transformation optimizes the query by leveraging joins and aggregates instead of nested sub-queries, which can improve performance and readability."""

Query Rewrite 5:
"""The query contains subqueries with `IN` predicates in the `WHERE` clause of the CTEs (`ss_items`, `cs_items`, `ws_items`). These subqueries can be optimized using semi-join techniques. For example, the subquery `d_date in (select d_date from date_dim where d_month_seq = (select d_month_seq from date_dim where d_date = '2000-01-02'))` can be transformed into a semi-join by pulling the relevant data into a temporary structure or scanning data in a manner that avoids processing duplicate information unnecessarily. This transformation reduces the result set size early in query processing, improving performance by discarding non-matching rows sooner."""

Query Rewrite 6:
"""The query performs `GROUP BY` operations in each CTE before joining them in the main query. To optimize performance, the `GROUP BY` operations can be rearranged to occur at the earliest stage possible. This involves ensuring that the aggregation is done before any joins, reducing the size of intermediate datasets. By pre-aggregating data in subqueries, the workload on subsequent join operations is minimized, enhancing overall execution speed and efficiency."""

Query Rewrite 7:
"""The query uses `LIMIT` and `ORDER BY`, which can be optimized by ensuring that the database engine stops the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained. This avoids full table sorts and reduces resource usage. The current query already leverages these optimizations by combining `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY`, ensuring efficient retrieval of the top 100 rows based on the specified order criteria."""

The original query had a `WHERE` clause with conditions such as `ss_item_rev between 0.9 * cs_item_rev and 1.1 * cs_item_rev`, which only involved columns from the `ss_items`, `cs_items`, and `ws_items` tables. These conditions were moved into the `ON` clause of the `INNER JOIN` operations, as they only reference columns from the joined tables and do not involve columns from both sides of the join. This transformation optimizes the query by reducing the size of the datasets before the join, improving query performance."""\n\nQuery Rewrite 2:\n"""The SQL query changes can be explained by Case 2 of the query rewrite rule. The original query had inner `SELECT` layers within the common table expressions (`ss_items`, `cs_items`, `ws_items`) that served as passthroughs for the columns used in the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions. The rewrite rule identified that these inner `SELECT` layers were unnecessary and removed them, allowing the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions to be directly applied to the data sources (`store_sales`, `catalog_sales`, `web_sales`, `item`, `date_dim`, `customer`). This simplification reduces the complexity of the query and improves performance by eliminating redundant projections and directly aggregating data from the joined tables."""\n\nQuery Rewrite 3:\n"""The SQL query changes can be explained as follows: The original query contained BETWEEN conditions that specified ranges for `ss_list_price`, `i_manager_id`, and `c_birth_year`. These conditions were simplified using the SEARCH predicate, which is a more efficient way to express range queries in SQL. This transformation aligns with Case 3 of the query rewrite rule, which aims to simplify conditions based on logical rules and known constraints. By converting the BETWEEN conditions into SEARCH predicates, the query becomes more efficient, potentially improving performance by allowing the database engine to better utilize indexes and optimize the execution plan."""\n\nQuery Rewrite 4:\n"""The SQL query changes can be explained as follows: The original query used an `IN` sub-query to filter dates based on a specific month sequence derived from another sub-query. This was transformed into a `LEFT JOIN` operation with an aggregate function (`SINGLE_VALUE`) to ensure that the sub-query returns a single value for the join condition. The `JOIN` operation is performed on the `d_month_seq` column, which correlates the outer query with the sub-query. This transformation optimizes the query by leveraging joins and aggregates instead of nested sub-queries, which can improve performance and readability."""\n\nQuery Rewrite 5:\n"""The query contains subqueries with `IN` predicates in the `WHERE` clause of the CTEs (`ss_items`, `cs_items`, `ws_items`). These subqueries can be optimized using semi-join techniques. For example, the subquery `d_date in (select d_date from date_dim where d_month_seq = (select d_month_seq from date_dim where d_date = \'2000-01-02\'))` can be transformed into a semi-join by pulling the relevant data into a temporary structure or scanning data in a manner that avoids processing duplicate information unnecessarily. This transformation reduces the result set size early in query processing, improving performance by discarding non-matching rows sooner."""\n\nQuery Rewrite 6:\n"""The query performs `GROUP BY` operations in each CTE before joining them in the main query. To optimize performance, the `GROUP BY` operations can be rearranged to occur at the earliest stage possible. This involves ensuring that the aggregation is done before any joins, reducing the size of intermediate datasets. By pre-aggregating data in subqueries, the workload on subsequent join operations is minimized, enhancing overall execution speed and efficiency."""\n\nQuery Rewrite 7:\n"""The query uses `LIMIT` and `ORDER BY`, which can be optimized by ensuring that the database engine stops the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained. This avoids full table sorts and reduces resource usage. The current query already leverages these optimizations by combining `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY`, ensuring efficient retrieval of the top 100 rows based on the specified order criteria."""'}], 'response': "To cluster the provided query rewrite strategies, we can group them based on the type of optimization or transformation they focus on.

These conditions were moved into the `ON` clause of the `INNER JOIN` operations, as they only reference columns from the joined tables and do not involve columns from both sides of the join. This transformation optimizes the query by reducing the size of the datasets before the join, improving query performance."""\n\nQuery Rewrite 2:\n"""The SQL query changes can be explained as follows: The original query used an `IN` sub-query to filter dates based on a specific month sequence derived from another sub-query.

The first strategy involves simplifying the query by removing unnecessary inner `SELECT` layers within the common table expressions (`ss_items`, `cs_items`, `ws_items`). These layers were initially used as passthroughs for columns involved in `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions, but they can be eliminated to allow direct application of these operations on the data sources (`store_sales`, `catalog_sales`, `web_sales`, `item`, `date_dim`, `customer`). This simplification reduces query complexity and enhances performance by removing redundant projections and directly aggregating data from the joined tables. The second strategy focuses on optimizing the `GROUP BY` operations by rearranging them to occur at the earliest possible stage. By pre-aggregating data in subqueries before any joins, the size of intermediate datasets is reduced, minimizing the workload on subsequent join operations and improving overall execution speed and efficiency. Together, these strategies streamline the query, making it more efficient and performant."""\n\n### Suggestion 3:\n"""The SQL query changes can be explained as follows: The original query contained BETWEEN conditions that specified ranges for `ss_list_price`, `i_manager_id`, and `c_birth_year`. These conditions were simplified using the SEARCH predicate, which is a more efficient way to express range queries in SQL. This transformation aligns with Case 3 of the query rewrite rule, which aims to simplify conditions based on logical rules and known constraints. By converting the BETWEEN conditions into SEARCH predicates, the query becomes more efficient, potentially improving performance by allowing the database engine to better utilize indexes and optimize the execution plan."""\n\n### Suggestion 4:\n"""The query uses `LIMIT` and `ORDER BY`, which can be optimized by ensuring that the database engine stops the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained. This avoids full table sorts and reduces resource usage. The current query already leverages these optimizations by combining `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY`, ensuring efficient retrieval of the top 100 rows based on the specified order criteria."""', 'selected_rules': [[{'name': 'FILTER_INTO_JOIN', 'rewrite': "Case 1:\n**Conditions**: This SQL query rewrite rule applies when a filter condition is placed on the result set of an INNER JOIN operation. The filter's expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there's a matching row in the non-preserving side's table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned."}, {'name': 'AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE', 'rewrite': 'Case 1:\n**Conditions**: - The SQL query contains a `GROUP BY` clause that groups by simple columns (no expressions in the `GROUP BY` list).\n- The aggregate functions in the `SELECT` clause operate directly on columns (no expressions inside the aggregate functions).\n- The `SELECT` clause only contains the columns used in the `GROUP BY` clause and the aggregates without any transformations or additional expressions.\n**Transformations**: - Directly apply the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions to the data source referred to in the `FROM` clause of the inner query before the projection.\n- Eliminate the outer projection layer if it only renames the columns without transforming them.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: - The `SELECT` clause of an outer query precisely matches the columns used in the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions of an inner query, without any column transformations or renamings.\n- The inner `SELECT` only serves as a passthrough for these columns.\n**Transformations**: - Remove the inner `SELECT` layer, directly applying the aggregate functions and `GROUP BY` to the original data source.'}, {'name': 'FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS', 'rewrite': "Case 1:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains conditions that can be statically determined as always true (e.g., constant expressions like `1=1` or tautologies based on the column data types and constraints), then these conditions don't affect the result set.\n**Transformations**: Remove such conditions from the WHERE clause.

Firstly, conditions in the `WHERE` clause that only involve columns from the `ss_items`, `cs_items`, and `ws_items` tables can be moved to the `ON` clause of `INNER JOIN` operations. This reduces the dataset size before the join, enhancing performance. Secondly, the query\'s use of `IN` sub-queries to filter dates can be transformed into `LEFT JOIN` operations with an aggregate function like `SINGLE_VALUE`, which ensures a single value for the join condition. This approach leverages joins and aggregates, improving performance and readability by avoiding nested sub-queries. Lastly, subqueries with `IN` predicates in the `WHERE` clause of the CTEs can be optimized using semi-join techniques. By transforming these subqueries into semi-joins, the query can reduce the result set size early in processing, discarding non-matching rows sooner and thus enhancing performance. These strategies collectively aim to streamline the query execution process, making it more efficient and easier to understand."""\n\n### Suggestion 2:\n"""The provided SQL query can be optimized using two main rewrite strategies. The first strategy involves simplifying the query by removing unnecessary inner `SELECT` layers within the common table expressions (`ss_items`, `cs_items`, `ws_items`). These layers were initially used as passthroughs for columns involved in `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions, but they can be eliminated to allow direct application of these operations on the data sources (`store_sales`, `catalog_sales`, `web_sales`, `item`, `date_dim`, `customer`). This simplification reduces query complexity and enhances performance by removing redundant projections and directly aggregating data from the joined tables. The second strategy focuses on optimizing the `GROUP BY` operations by rearranging them to occur at the earliest possible stage. By pre-aggregating data in subqueries before any joins, the size of intermediate datasets is reduced, minimizing the workload on subsequent join operations and improving overall execution speed and efficiency. Together, these strategies streamline the query, making it more efficient and performant."""\n\n### Suggestion 3:\n"""The SQL query changes can be explained as follows: The original query contained BETWEEN conditions that specified ranges for `ss_list_price`, `i_manager_id`, and `c_birth_year`. These conditions were simplified using the SEARCH predicate, which is a more efficient way to express range queries in SQL. This transformation aligns with Case 3 of the query rewrite rule, which aims to simplify conditions based on logical rules and known constraints. By converting the BETWEEN conditions into SEARCH predicates, the query becomes more efficient, potentially improving performance by allowing the database engine to better utilize indexes and optimize the execution plan."""\n\n### Suggestion 4:\n"""The query uses `LIMIT` and `ORDER BY`, which can be optimized by ensuring that the database engine stops the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained. This avoids full table sorts and reduces resource usage. The current query already leverages these optimizations by combining `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY`, ensuring efficient retrieval of the top 100 rows based on the specified order criteria."""\n\nQuery Rewrite Rules:\n### Rule FILTER_INTO_JOIN:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: This SQL query rewrite rule applies when a filter condition is placed on the result set of an INNER JOIN operation. The filter\'s expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there\'s a matching row in the non-preserving side\'s table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned."""\n\n### Rule AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: - The SQL query contains a `GROUP BY` clause that groups by simple columns (no expressions in the `GROUP BY` list).\n- The aggregate functions in the `SELECT` clause operate directly on columns (no expressions inside the aggregate functions).\n- The `SELECT` clause only contains the columns used in the `GROUP BY` clause and the aggregates without any transformations or additional expressions.\n**Transformations**: - Directly apply the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions to the data source referred to in the `FROM` clause of the inner query before the projection.\n- Eliminate the outer projection layer if it only renames the columns without transforming them.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: - The `SELECT` clause of an outer query precisely matches the columns used in the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions of an inner query, without any column transformations or renamings.\n- The inner `SELECT` only serves as a passthrough for these columns.\n**Transformations**: - Remove the inner `SELECT` layer, directly applying the aggregate functions and `GROUP BY` to the original data source."""\n\n### Rule FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains conditions that can be statically determined as always true (e.g., constant expressions like `1=1` or tautologies based on the column data types and constraints), then these conditions don\'t affect the result set.\n**Transformations**: Remove such conditions from the WHERE clause. If this results in an empty WHERE clause, remove the WHERE clause entirely.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause simplifies to conditions that are always false or involve comparisons with NULL in a way that the outcome is always false or NULL (e.g., `column != column` or `1=0`), indicating no rows can satisfy the filter.\n**Transformations**: Replace the query with one that selects no rows. This could be represented in different ways based on the SQL dialect. One universal method might be selecting from a dual table with a false condition.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains complex conditions that can be simplified based on known constraints, constants, or through logical simplification (e.g., `column IS NOT NULL AND column IS NOT NULL` simplifies to `column IS NOT NULL`).\n**Transformations**: Simplify the conditions according to logical rules and known constraints. Remove redundancy and unnecessary complexity."""\n\n### Rule FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: The query contains a scalar sub-query within the WHERE clause.\n**Transformations**: The scalar sub-query should be transformed into a LEFT JOIN operation with an aggregate function on the column(s) being selected in the sub-query. The JOIN condition uses the correlation ID (the matching column(s) in both outer and sub-query).\n  - Original Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 WHERE column = (SELECT AGG_FUNCTION(column2) FROM table2 WHERE table1.join_column = table2.join_column)\n  - Transformed Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 LEFT JOIN (SELECT join_column, AGG_FUNCTION(column2) AS agg_result FROM table2 GROUP BY join_column) AS sub_query ON table1.join_column = sub_query.join_column WHERE column = sub_query.agg_result\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: The query contains `IN`, `EXISTS`, or `UNIQUE` sub-queries within the WHERE clause that are correlated with the outer query.\n**Transformations**: - For `IN` Sub-queries: Replace the `IN` clause with a JOIN operation and a WHERE condition that checks for non-null values on the side of the sub-query.\n    - Original Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 WHERE column IN (SELECT column2 FROM table2 WHERE table1.join_column = table2.join_column)\n    - Transformed Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.join_column = table2.join_column WHERE table2.column2 IS NOT NULL\n  - For `EXISTS` Sub-queries: Convert the `EXISTS` condition into a JOIN operation, using WHERE to filter rows that match the JOIN condition.\n    - Original Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM table2 WHERE table1.join_column = table2.join_class)\n    - Transformed Query Structure: SELECT DISTINCT table1.* FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.join_column = table2.join_column\n  - For `UNIQUE` Sub-queries: Since `UNIQUE` requires a bit more complex handling not directly mappable to a standard JOIN, it should be considered a special case where the goal is to ensure that rows from the outer query match a unique set in the sub-query. This might not translate directly into SQL syntax without additional sub-query or DISTINCT aggregation."""\n\n### Rule SORT_PROJECT_TRANSPOSE:\n"""**Conditions**: If a SQL query executes a sort operation on columns that are directly referenced in the SELECT list or through expressions that are strictly monotonic transformations of these columns, and the sort operation directly follows these projections (SELECT statements), the sort operation can be pushed to operate directly on the table (FROM clause) before the projection.\n**Transformations**: 1. Check Compatibility: Ensure both sort and project (SELECT and ORDER BY clauses) involve compatible operations that relate directly to the raw column data or involve monotonic transformations.\n2. Analyze Order By Fields: Verify that each column in the ORDER BY clause is directly represented in the SELECT list or is a derived column through a monotonic transformation (e.g., casting integers to floats where the order is preserved).\n3. Adjust SQL Query: Rewrite the query so that sorting (ORDER BY clause) is applied to the raw table data in the FROM clause rather than after the projection. This might involve introducing a subquery or CTE (Common Table Expression) where the sorting is applied first, followed by the projections.\n4. Optimize Projection: Ensure that the SELECT list in the outer query matches the original projection, applying on top of the sorted data now."""\n\n### Rule PROJECT_FILTER_TRANSPOSE:\n"""**Conditions**: This rewrite rule can be applied when an SQL query contains a SELECT operation (acting as the `Project` operation) followed by a WHERE clause (acting as the `Filter` operation), provided that the SELECT does not contain window functions (such as RANK(), ROW_NUMBER(), etc.) and the columns selected do not affect the outcome of the WHERE clause.\n**Transformations**: To apply the rule, refactor the SQL query so that the conditions in the WHERE clause are evaluated before the columns are selected in the SELECT clause. This may involve moving computations or column transformations from the SELECT clause to a sub-query that the WHERE clause is applied on, ensuring the final SELECT clause on the outermost query matches the original query\'s expected outcome. - Before: SELECT col1, transformation_function(col2) FROM table WHERE condition; - After: SELECT col1, transformation_function(col2) FROM (SELECT col1, col2 FROM table WHERE condition) AS subquery;"""\n\n### Rule AGGREGATE_REDUCE_FUNCTIONS:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: any SELECT statement or subquery using the AVG aggregate function\n**Transformations**: AVG(x) as SUM(x) / COUNT(x)\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: computing the population standard deviation\n**Transformations**: STDDEV_POP(x) as the square root of (`SUM(x^2) - SUM(x)^2 / COUNT(x)`) / COUNT(x)\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: for the sample standard deviation computation\n**Transformations**: STDDEV_SAMP(x) as the square root of (`SUM(x^2) - SUM(x)^2 / COUNT(x)`) / (COUNT(x) - 1)\nCase 4:\n**Conditions**: for the population variance computation\n**Transformations**: VAR_POP(x) as (`SUM(x^2) - SUM(x)^2 / COUNT(x)`) / COUNT(x)\nCase 5:\n**Conditions**: for the sample variance computation\n**Transformations**: VAR_SAMP(x) as (`SUM(x^2) - SUM(x)^2 / COUNT(x)`) / (COUNT(x) - 1)\nCase 6:\n**Conditions**: to compute population covariance\n**Transformations**: COVAR_POP(x, y) by applying a formula involving SUM and COUNT\nCase 7:\n**Conditions**: using a formula for sample covariance\n**Transformations**: COVAR_SAMP(x, y) using a formula involving SUM, COUNT, and an adjustment for sample calculations\nCase 8:\n**Conditions**: for transforming REGR_SXX(x, y) and REGR_SYY(x, y)\n**Transformations**: into expressions involving the computation of VAR_POP(x) or VAR_POP(y) respectively, multiplied by REGR_COUNT(x, y)"""\n\n### Rule JOIN_TO_CORRELATE:\n"""**Conditions**: The join type is either INNER JOIN or LEFT JOIN. There are no requirements in the query that would inherently create NULL values on the left side when there are no matching rows on the right side (for INNER JOIN, this condition is naturally met; for LEFT JOIN, it is met if every row on the left side has at least one corresponding row on the right side according to the join condition).\n**Transformations**: 1. Identify the INNER JOIN or LEFT JOIN condition in the SQL query. 2. Extract the ON clause representing the join condition. 3. For INNER JOIN: - Replace the INNER JOIN with a WHERE EXISTS clause, moving the original join condition into the WHERE clause of a subquery that selects from the right side table. Reference the left side columns as correlation variables in the subquery\'s WHERE clause. - Example Transformation: SELECT * FROM left_table INNER JOIN right_table ON left_table.id = right_table.foreign_id Becomes: SELECT * FROM left_table WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM right_table WHERE left_table.id = right_table.foreign_id) 4. For LEFT JOIN: - Replace the LEFT JOIN with a LEFT OUTER JOIN subquery that is correlated to the outer query. In the SELECT clause of the outer query, include a CASE statement or similar logic to handle selection from the subquery result. - Example Transformation: SELECT left_table.*, right_table.* FROM left_table LEFT JOIN right_table ON left_table.id = right_table.foreign_id Becomes: SELECT left_table.*, COALESCE(subquery.alias1, \'default\') FROM left_table LEFT OUTER JOIN (SELECT foreign_id, column1 AS alias1 FROM right_table) subquery ON left_table.id = subquery.foreign_id"""'}], 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'stream': False, 'temperature': 0.1}}

Firstly, conditions in the `WHERE` clause that only involve columns from the `ss_items`, `cs_items`, and `ws_items` tables can be moved to the `ON` clause of `INNER JOIN` operations. This reduces the dataset size before the join, enhancing performance. Secondly, the query\'s use of `IN` sub-queries to filter dates can be transformed into `LEFT JOIN` operations with an aggregate function like `SINGLE_VALUE`, which ensures a single value for the join condition. This approach leverages joins and aggregates, improving performance and readability by avoiding nested sub-queries. Lastly, subqueries with `IN` predicates in the `WHERE` clause of the CTEs can be optimized using semi-join techniques. By transforming these subqueries into semi-joins, the query can reduce the result set size early in processing, discarding non-matching rows sooner and thus enhancing performance. These strategies collectively aim to streamline the query execution process, making it more efficient and easier to understand."""\n\n### Suggestion 2:\n"""The provided SQL query can be optimized using two main rewrite strategies. The first strategy involves simplifying the query by removing unnecessary inner `SELECT` layers within the common table expressions (`ss_items`, `cs_items`, `ws_items`). These layers were initially used as passthroughs for columns involved in `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions, but they can be eliminated to allow direct application of these operations on the data sources (`store_sales`, `catalog_sales`, `web_sales`, `item`, `date_dim`, `customer`). This simplification reduces query complexity and enhances performance by removing redundant projections and directly aggregating data from the joined tables. The second strategy focuses on optimizing the `GROUP BY` operations by rearranging them to occur at the earliest possible stage. By pre-aggregating data in subqueries before any joins, the size of intermediate datasets is reduced, minimizing the workload on subsequent join operations and improving overall execution speed and efficiency. Together, these strategies streamline the query, making it more efficient and performant."""\n\n### Suggestion 3:\n"""The SQL query changes can be explained as follows: The original query contained BETWEEN conditions that specified ranges for `ss_list_price`, `i_manager_id`, and `c_birth_year`. These conditions were simplified using the SEARCH predicate, which is a more efficient way to express range queries in SQL. This transformation aligns with Case 3 of the query rewrite rule, which aims to simplify conditions based on logical rules and known constraints. By converting the BETWEEN conditions into SEARCH predicates, the query becomes more efficient, potentially improving performance by allowing the database engine to better utilize indexes and optimize the execution plan."""\n\n### Suggestion 4:\n"""The query uses `LIMIT` and `ORDER BY`, which can be optimized by ensuring that the database engine stops the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained. This avoids full table sorts and reduces resource usage. The current query already leverages these optimizations by combining `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY`, ensuring efficient retrieval of the top 100 rows based on the specified order criteria."""\n\nQuery Rewrite Rules:\n### Rule FILTER_INTO_JOIN:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: This SQL query rewrite rule applies when a filter condition is placed on the result set of an INNER JOIN operation. The filter\'s expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there\'s a matching row in the non-preserving side\'s table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned."""\n\n### Rule AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: - The SQL query contains a `GROUP BY` clause that groups by simple columns (no expressions in the `GROUP BY` list).\n- The aggregate functions in the `SELECT` clause operate directly on columns (no expressions inside the aggregate functions).\n- The `SELECT` clause only contains the columns used in the `GROUP BY` clause and the aggregates without any transformations or additional expressions.\n**Transformations**: - Directly apply the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions to the data source referred to in the `FROM` clause of the inner query before the projection.\n- Eliminate the outer projection layer if it only renames the columns without transforming them.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: - The `SELECT` clause of an outer query precisely matches the columns used in the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions of an inner query, without any column transformations or renamings.\n- The inner `SELECT` only serves as a passthrough for these columns.\n**Transformations**: - Remove the inner `SELECT` layer, directly applying the aggregate functions and `GROUP BY` to the original data source."""\n\n### Rule FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains conditions that can be statically determined as always true (e.g., constant expressions like `1=1` or tautologies based on the column data types and constraints), then these conditions don\'t affect the result set.\n**Transformations**: Remove such conditions from the WHERE clause. If this results in an empty WHERE clause, remove the WHERE clause entirely.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause simplifies to conditions that are always false or involve comparisons with NULL in a way that the outcome is always false or NULL (e.g., `column != column` or `1=0`), indicating no rows can satisfy the filter.\n**Transformations**: Replace the query with one that selects no rows. This could be represented in different ways based on the SQL dialect. One universal method might be selecting from a dual table with a false condition.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains complex conditions that can be simplified based on known constraints, constants, or through logical simplification (e.g., `column IS NOT NULL AND column IS NOT NULL` simplifies to `column IS NOT NULL`).\n**Transformations**: Simplify the conditions according to logical rules and known constraints. Remove redundancy and unnecessary complexity."""\n\n### Rule FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: The query contains a scalar sub-query within the WHERE clause.\n**Transformations**: The scalar sub-query should be transformed into a LEFT JOIN operation with an aggregate function on the column(s) being selected in the sub-query. The JOIN condition uses the correlation ID (the matching column(s) in both outer and sub-query).\n  - Original Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 WHERE column = (SELECT AGG_FUNCTION(column2) FROM table2 WHERE table1.join_column = table2.join_column)\n  - Transformed Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 LEFT JOIN (SELECT join_column, AGG_FUNCTION(column2) AS agg_result FROM table2 GROUP BY join_column) AS sub_query ON table1.join_column = sub_query.join_column WHERE column = sub_query.agg_result\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: The query contains `IN`, `EXISTS`, or `UNIQUE` sub-queries within the WHERE clause that are correlated with the outer query.\n**Transformations**: - For `IN` Sub-queries: Replace the `IN` clause with a JOIN operation and a WHERE condition that checks for non-null values on the side of the sub-query.\n    - Original Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 WHERE column IN (SELECT column2 FROM table2 WHERE table1.join_column = table2.join_column)\n    - Transformed Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.join_column = table2.join_column WHERE table2.column2 IS NOT NULL\n  - For `EXISTS` Sub-queries: Convert the `EXISTS` condition into a JOIN operation, using WHERE to filter rows that match the JOIN condition.\n    - Original Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM table2 WHERE table1.join_column = table2.join_class)\n    - Transformed Query Structure: SELECT DISTINCT table1.* FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.join_column = table2.join_column\n  - For `UNIQUE` Sub-queries: Since `UNIQUE` requires a bit more complex handling not directly mappable to a standard JOIN, it should be considered a special case where the goal is to ensure that rows from the outer query match a unique set in the sub-query. This might not translate directly into SQL syntax without additional sub-query or DISTINCT aggregation."""\n\n### Rule SORT_PROJECT_TRANSPOSE:\n"""**Conditions**: If a SQL query executes a sort operation on columns that are directly referenced in the SELECT list or through expressions that are strictly monotonic transformations of these columns, and the sort operation directly follows these projections (SELECT statements), the sort operation can be pushed to operate directly on the table (FROM clause) before the projection.\n**Transformations**: 1. Check Compatibility: Ensure both sort and project (SELECT and ORDER BY clauses) involve compatible operations that relate directly to the raw column data or involve monotonic transformations.\n2. Analyze Order By Fields: Verify that each column in the ORDER BY clause is directly represented in the SELECT list or is a derived column through a monotonic transformation (e.g., casting integers to floats where the order is preserved).\n3. Adjust SQL Query: Rewrite the query so that sorting (ORDER BY clause) is applied to the raw table data in the FROM clause rather than after the projection. This might involve introducing a subquery or CTE (Common Table Expression) where the sorting is applied first, followed by the projections.\n4. Optimize Projection: Ensure that the SELECT list in the outer query matches the original projection, applying on top of the sorted data now."""\n\n### Rule PROJECT_FILTER_TRANSPOSE:\n"""**Conditions**: This rewrite rule can be applied when an SQL query contains a SELECT operation (acting as the `Project` operation) followed by a WHERE clause (acting as the `Filter` operation), provided that the SELECT does not contain window functions (such as RANK(), ROW_NUMBER(), etc.) and the columns selected do not affect the outcome of the WHERE clause.\n**Transformations**: To apply the rule, refactor the SQL query so that the conditions in the WHERE clause are evaluated before the columns are selected in the SELECT clause. This may involve moving computations or column transformations from the SELECT clause to a sub-query that the WHERE clause is applied on, ensuring the final SELECT clause on the outermost query matches the original query\'s expected outcome. - Before: SELECT col1, transformation_function(col2) FROM table WHERE condition; - After: SELECT col1, transformation_function(col2) FROM (SELECT col1, col2 FROM table WHERE condition) AS subquery;"""\n\n### Rule AGGREGATE_REDUCE_FUNCTIONS:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: any SELECT statement or subquery using the AVG aggregate function\n**Transformations**: AVG(x) as SUM(x) / COUNT(x)\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: computing the population standard deviation\n**Transformations**: STDDEV_POP(x) as the square root of (`SUM(x^2) - SUM(x)^2 / COUNT(x)`) / COUNT(x)\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: for the sample standard deviation computation\n**Transformations**: STDDEV_SAMP(x) as the square root of (`SUM(x^2) - SUM(x)^2 / COUNT(x)`) / (COUNT(x) - 1)\nCase 4:\n**Conditions**: for the population variance computation\n**Transformations**: VAR_POP(x) as (`SUM(x^2) - SUM(x)^2 / COUNT(x)`) / COUNT(x)\nCase 5:\n**Conditions**: for the sample variance computation\n**Transformations**: VAR_SAMP(x) as (`SUM(x^2) - SUM(x)^2 / COUNT(x)`) / (COUNT(x) - 1)\nCase 6:\n**Conditions**: to compute population covariance\n**Transformations**: COVAR_POP(x, y) by applying a formula involving SUM and COUNT\nCase 7:\n**Conditions**: using a formula for sample covariance\n**Transformations**: COVAR_SAMP(x, y) using a formula involving SUM, COUNT, and an adjustment for sample calculations\nCase 8:\n**Conditions**: for transforming REGR_SXX(x, y) and REGR_SYY(x, y)\n**Transformations**: into expressions involving the computation of VAR_POP(x) or VAR_POP(y) respectively, multiplied by REGR_COUNT(x, y)"""\n\n### Rule JOIN_TO_CORRELATE:\n"""**Conditions**: The join type is either INNER JOIN or LEFT JOIN. There are no requirements in the query that would inherently create NULL values on the left side when there are no matching rows on the right side (for INNER JOIN, this condition is naturally met; for LEFT JOIN, it is met if every row on the left side has at least one corresponding row on the right side according to the join condition).\n**Transformations**: 1. Identify the INNER JOIN or LEFT JOIN condition in the SQL query. 2. Extract the ON clause representing the join condition. 3. For INNER JOIN: - Replace the INNER JOIN with a WHERE EXISTS clause, moving the original join condition into the WHERE clause of a subquery that selects from the right side table.

For LEFT JOIN: - Replace the LEFT JOIN with a LEFT OUTER JOIN subquery that is correlated to the outer query.

Firstly, conditions in the `WHERE` clause that only involve columns from the `ss_items`, `cs_items`, and `ws_items` tables can be moved to the `ON` clause of `INNER JOIN` operations. This reduces the dataset size before the join, enhancing performance. Secondly, the query\'s use of `IN` sub-queries to filter dates can be transformed into `LEFT JOIN` operations with an aggregate function like `SINGLE_VALUE`, which ensures a single value for the join condition. This approach leverages joins and aggregates, improving performance and readability by avoiding nested sub-queries. Lastly, subqueries with `IN` predicates in the `WHERE` clause of the CTEs can be optimized using semi-join techniques. By transforming these subqueries into semi-joins, the query can reduce the result set size early in processing, discarding non-matching rows sooner and thus enhancing performance. These strategies collectively aim to streamline the query execution process, making it more efficient and easier to understand."""\n\n### Suggestion 2:\n"""The provided SQL query can be optimized using two main rewrite strategies. The first strategy involves simplifying the query by removing unnecessary inner `SELECT` layers within the common table expressions (`ss_items`, `cs_items`, `ws_items`). These layers were initially used as passthroughs for columns involved in `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions, but they can be eliminated to allow direct application of these operations on the data sources (`store_sales`, `catalog_sales`, `web_sales`, `item`, `date_dim`, `customer`). This simplification reduces query complexity and enhances performance by removing redundant projections and directly aggregating data from the joined tables. The second strategy focuses on optimizing the `GROUP BY` operations by rearranging them to occur at the earliest possible stage. By pre-aggregating data in subqueries before any joins, the size of intermediate datasets is reduced, minimizing the workload on subsequent join operations and improving overall execution speed and efficiency. Together, these strategies streamline the query, making it more efficient and performant."""\n\n### Suggestion 3:\n"""The SQL query changes can be explained as follows: The original query contained BETWEEN conditions that specified ranges for `ss_list_price`, `i_manager_id`, and `c_birth_year`. These conditions were simplified using the SEARCH predicate, which is a more efficient way to express range queries in SQL. This transformation aligns with Case 3 of the query rewrite rule, which aims to simplify conditions based on logical rules and known constraints. By converting the BETWEEN conditions into SEARCH predicates, the query becomes more efficient, potentially improving performance by allowing the database engine to better utilize indexes and optimize the execution plan."""\n\n### Suggestion 4:\n"""The query uses `LIMIT` and `ORDER BY`, which can be optimized by ensuring that the database engine stops the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained. This avoids full table sorts and reduces resource usage. The current query already leverages these optimizations by combining `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY`, ensuring efficient retrieval of the top 100 rows based on the specified order criteria."""\n\nQuery Rewrite Rule Sets:\n### AGGREGATE Operator Rules: ["AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE"]\n\n### CORRELATE Operator Rules: ["FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE"]\n\n### FILTER Operator Rules: ["FILTER_INTO_JOIN", "FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS", "FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE"]\n\n### JOIN Operator Rules: ["FILTER_INTO_JOIN"]\n\n### PROJECT Operator Rules: ["AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE", "SORT_PROJECT_TRANSPOSE"]\n\n### SORT Operator Rules: ["SORT_PROJECT_TRANSPOSE"]\n\nQuery Rewrite Rule Explanations:\n### Rule FILTER_INTO_JOIN:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: This SQL query rewrite rule applies when a filter condition is placed on the result set of an INNER JOIN operation. The filter\'s expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there\'s a matching row in the non-preserving side\'s table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned."""\n\n### Rule AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: - The SQL query contains a `GROUP BY` clause that groups by simple columns (no expressions in the `GROUP BY` list).\n- The aggregate functions in the `SELECT` clause operate directly on columns (no expressions inside the aggregate functions).\n- The `SELECT` clause only contains the columns used in the `GROUP BY` clause and the aggregates without any transformations or additional expressions.\n**Transformations**: - Directly apply the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions to the data source referred to in the `FROM` clause of the inner query before the projection.\n- Eliminate the outer projection layer if it only renames the columns without transforming them.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: - The `SELECT` clause of an outer query precisely matches the columns used in the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions of an inner query, without any column transformations or renamings.\n- The inner `SELECT` only serves as a passthrough for these columns.\n**Transformations**: - Remove the inner `SELECT` layer, directly applying the aggregate functions and `GROUP BY` to the original data source."""\n\n### Rule FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains conditions that can be statically determined as always true (e.g., constant expressions like `1=1` or tautologies based on the column data types and constraints), then these conditions don\'t affect the result set.\n**Transformations**: Remove such conditions from the WHERE clause. If this results in an empty WHERE clause, remove the WHERE clause entirely.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause simplifies to conditions that are always false or involve comparisons with NULL in a way that the outcome is always false or NULL (e.g., `column != column` or `1=0`), indicating no rows can satisfy the filter.\n**Transformations**: Replace the query with one that selects no rows. This could be represented in different ways based on the SQL dialect. One universal method might be selecting from a dual table with a false condition.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains complex conditions that can be simplified based on known constraints, constants, or through logical simplification (e.g., `column IS NOT NULL AND column IS NOT NULL` simplifies to `column IS NOT NULL`).\n**Transformations**: Simplify the conditions according to logical rules and known constraints. Remove redundancy and unnecessary complexity."""\n\n### Rule FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: The query contains a scalar sub-query within the WHERE clause.\n**Transformations**: The scalar sub-query should be transformed into a LEFT JOIN operation with an aggregate function on the column(s) being selected in the sub-query. The JOIN condition uses the correlation ID (the matching column(s) in both outer and sub-query).\n  - Original Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 WHERE column = (SELECT AGG_FUNCTION(column2) FROM table2 WHERE table1.join_column = table2.join_column)\n  - Transformed Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 LEFT JOIN (SELECT join_column, AGG_FUNCTION(column2) AS agg_result FROM table2 GROUP BY join_column) AS sub_query ON table1.join_column = sub_query.join_column WHERE column = sub_query.agg_result\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: The query contains `IN`, `EXISTS`, or `UNIQUE` sub-queries within the WHERE clause that are correlated with the outer query.\n**Transformations**: - For `IN` Sub-queries: Replace the `IN` clause with a JOIN operation and a WHERE condition that checks for non-null values on the side of the sub-query.\n    - Original Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 WHERE column IN (SELECT column2 FROM table2 WHERE table1.join_column = table2.join_column)\n    - Transformed Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.join_column = table2.join_column WHERE table2.column2 IS NOT NULL\n  - For `EXISTS` Sub-queries: Convert the `EXISTS` condition into a JOIN operation, using WHERE to filter rows that match the JOIN condition.\n    - Original Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM table2 WHERE table1.join_column = table2.join_class)\n    - Transformed Query Structure: SELECT DISTINCT table1.* FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.join_column = table2.join_column\n  - For `UNIQUE` Sub-queries: Since `UNIQUE` requires a bit more complex handling not directly mappable to a standard JOIN, it should be considered a special case where the goal is to ensure that rows from the outer query match a unique set in the sub-query. This might not translate directly into SQL syntax without additional sub-query or DISTINCT aggregation."""\n\n### Rule SORT_PROJECT_TRANSPOSE:\n"""**Conditions**: If a SQL query executes a sort operation on columns that are directly referenced in the SELECT list or through expressions that are strictly monotonic transformations of these columns, and the sort operation directly follows these projections (SELECT statements), the sort operation can be pushed to operate directly on the table (FROM clause) before the projection.\n**Transformations**: 1. Check Compatibility: Ensure both sort and project (SELECT and ORDER BY clauses) involve compatible operations that relate directly to the raw column data or involve monotonic transformations.\n2. Analyze Order By Fields: Verify that each column in the ORDER BY clause is directly represented in the SELECT list or is a derived column through a monotonic transformation (e.g., casting integers to floats where the order is preserved).\n3. Adjust SQL Query: Rewrite the query so that sorting (ORDER BY clause) is applied to the raw table data in the FROM clause rather than after the projection. This might involve introducing a subquery or CTE (Common Table Expression) where the sorting is applied first, followed by the projections.\n4. Optimize Projection: Ensure that the SELECT list in the outer query matches the original projection, applying on top of the sorted data now."""'}], 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'stream': False, 'temperature': 0.1}}

Firstly, conditions in the `WHERE` clause that only involve columns from the `ss_items`, `cs_items`, and `ws_items` tables can be moved to the `ON` clause of `INNER JOIN` operations. This reduces the dataset size before the join, enhancing performance. Secondly, the query\'s use of `IN` sub-queries to filter dates can be transformed into `LEFT JOIN` operations with an aggregate function like `SINGLE_VALUE`, which ensures a single value for the join condition. This approach leverages joins and aggregates, improving performance and readability by avoiding nested sub-queries. Lastly, subqueries with `IN` predicates in the `WHERE` clause of the CTEs can be optimized using semi-join techniques. By transforming these subqueries into semi-joins, the query can reduce the result set size early in processing, discarding non-matching rows sooner and thus enhancing performance. These strategies collectively aim to streamline the query execution process, making it more efficient and easier to understand."""\n\n### Suggestion 2:\n"""The provided SQL query can be optimized using two main rewrite strategies. The first strategy involves simplifying the query by removing unnecessary inner `SELECT` layers within the common table expressions (`ss_items`, `cs_items`, `ws_items`). These layers were initially used as passthroughs for columns involved in `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions, but they can be eliminated to allow direct application of these operations on the data sources (`store_sales`, `catalog_sales`, `web_sales`, `item`, `date_dim`, `customer`). This simplification reduces query complexity and enhances performance by removing redundant projections and directly aggregating data from the joined tables. The second strategy focuses on optimizing the `GROUP BY` operations by rearranging them to occur at the earliest possible stage. By pre-aggregating data in subqueries before any joins, the size of intermediate datasets is reduced, minimizing the workload on subsequent join operations and improving overall execution speed and efficiency. Together, these strategies streamline the query, making it more efficient and performant."""\n\n### Suggestion 3:\n"""The SQL query changes can be explained as follows: The original query contained BETWEEN conditions that specified ranges for `ss_list_price`, `i_manager_id`, and `c_birth_year`. These conditions were simplified using the SEARCH predicate, which is a more efficient way to express range queries in SQL. This transformation aligns with Case 3 of the query rewrite rule, which aims to simplify conditions based on logical rules and known constraints. By converting the BETWEEN conditions into SEARCH predicates, the query becomes more efficient, potentially improving performance by allowing the database engine to better utilize indexes and optimize the execution plan."""\n\n### Suggestion 4:\n"""The query uses `LIMIT` and `ORDER BY`, which can be optimized by ensuring that the database engine stops the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained. This avoids full table sorts and reduces resource usage. The current query already leverages these optimizations by combining `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY`, ensuring efficient retrieval of the top 100 rows based on the specified order criteria."""\n\nQuery Rewrite Rule Sets:\n### AGGREGATE Operator Rules: ["AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE"]\n\n### CORRELATE Operator Rules: ["FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE"]\n\n### FILTER Operator Rules: ["FILTER_INTO_JOIN", "FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS", "FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE"]\n\n### JOIN Operator Rules: ["FILTER_INTO_JOIN"]\n\n### PROJECT Operator Rules: ["AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE", "SORT_PROJECT_TRANSPOSE"]\n\n### SORT Operator Rules: ["SORT_PROJECT_TRANSPOSE"]\n\nQuery Rewrite Rule Explanations:\n### Rule FILTER_INTO_JOIN:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: This SQL query rewrite rule applies when a filter condition is placed on the result set of an INNER JOIN operation. The filter\'s expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there\'s a matching row in the non-preserving side\'s table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned."""\n\n### Rule AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: - The SQL query contains a `GROUP BY` clause that groups by simple columns (no expressions in the `GROUP BY` list).\n- The aggregate functions in the `SELECT` clause operate directly on columns (no expressions inside the aggregate functions).\n- The `SELECT` clause only contains the columns used in the `GROUP BY` clause and the aggregates without any transformations or additional expressions.\n**Transformations**: - Directly apply the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions to the data source referred to in the `FROM` clause of the inner query before the projection.\n- Eliminate the outer projection layer if it only renames the columns without transforming them.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: - The `SELECT` clause of an outer query precisely matches the columns used in the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions of an inner query, without any column transformations or renamings.\n- The inner `SELECT` only serves as a passthrough for these columns.\n**Transformations**: - Remove the inner `SELECT` layer, directly applying the aggregate functions and `GROUP BY` to the original data source."""\n\n### Rule FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains conditions that can be statically determined as always true (e.g., constant expressions like `1=1` or tautologies based on the column data types and constraints), then these conditions don\'t affect the result set.\n**Transformations**: Remove such conditions from the WHERE clause. If this results in an empty WHERE clause, remove the WHERE clause entirely.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause simplifies to conditions that are always false or involve comparisons with NULL in a way that the outcome is always false or NULL (e.g., `column != column` or `1=0`), indicating no rows can satisfy the filter.\n**Transformations**: Replace the query with one that selects no rows. This could be represented in different ways based on the SQL dialect. One universal method might be selecting from a dual table with a false condition.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains complex conditions that can be simplified based on known constraints, constants, or through logical simplification (e.g., `column IS NOT NULL AND column IS NOT NULL` simplifies to `column IS NOT NULL`).\n**Transformations**: Simplify the conditions according to logical rules and known constraints. Remove redundancy and unnecessary complexity."""\n\n### Rule FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: The query contains a scalar sub-query within the WHERE clause.\n**Transformations**: The scalar sub-query should be transformed into a LEFT JOIN operation with an aggregate function on the column(s) being selected in the sub-query. The JOIN condition uses the correlation ID (the matching column(s) in both outer and sub-query).\n  - Original Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 WHERE column = (SELECT AGG_FUNCTION(column2) FROM table2 WHERE table1.join_column = table2.join_column)\n  - Transformed Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 LEFT JOIN (SELECT join_column, AGG_FUNCTION(column2) AS agg_result FROM table2 GROUP BY join_column) AS sub_query ON table1.join_column = sub_query.join_column WHERE column = sub_query.agg_result\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: The query contains `IN`, `EXISTS`, or `UNIQUE` sub-queries within the WHERE clause that are correlated with the outer query.\n**Transformations**: - For `IN` Sub-queries: Replace the `IN` clause with a JOIN operation and a WHERE condition that checks for non-null values on the side of the sub-query.\n    - Original Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 WHERE column IN (SELECT column2 FROM table2 WHERE table1.join_column = table2.join_column)\n    - Transformed Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.join_column = table2.join_column WHERE table2.column2 IS NOT NULL\n  - For `EXISTS` Sub-queries: Convert the `EXISTS` condition into a JOIN operation, using WHERE to filter rows that match the JOIN condition.\n    - Original Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM table2 WHERE table1.join_column = table2.join_class)\n    - Transformed Query Structure: SELECT DISTINCT table1.* FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.join_column = table2.join_column\n  - For `UNIQUE` Sub-queries: Since `UNIQUE` requires a bit more complex handling not directly mappable to a standard JOIN, it should be considered a special case where the goal is to ensure that rows from the outer query match a unique set in the sub-query. This might not translate directly into SQL syntax without additional sub-query or DISTINCT aggregation."""\n\n### Rule SORT_PROJECT_TRANSPOSE:\n"""**Conditions**: If a SQL query executes a sort operation on columns that are directly referenced in the SELECT list or through expressions that are strictly monotonic transformations of these columns, and the sort operation directly follows these projections (SELECT statements), the sort operation can be pushed to operate directly on the table (FROM clause) before the projection.\n**Transformations**: 1. Check Compatibility: Ensure both sort and project (SELECT and ORDER BY clauses) involve compatible operations that relate directly to the raw column data or involve monotonic transformations.\n2. Analyze Order By Fields: Verify that each column in the ORDER BY clause is directly represented in the SELECT list or is a derived column through a monotonic transformation (e.g., casting integers to floats where the order is preserved).\n3. Adjust SQL Query: Rewrite the query so that sorting (ORDER BY clause) is applied to the raw table data in the FROM clause rather than after the projection. This might involve introducing a subquery or CTE (Common Table Expression) where the sorting is applied first, followed by the projections.\n4. Optimize Projection: Ensure that the SELECT list in the outer query matches the original projection, applying on top of the sorted data now."""'}], 'response': 'Step 1: To align the query rewrite rules with the provided suggestions, we need to prioritize the rules based on the suggestions and their relevance to the SQL query. Here\'s the reasoning for each rule set:\n\n1. **AGGREGATE Operator Rules**: The suggestion to simplify the query by removing unnecessary inner `SELECT` layers and optimizing `GROUP BY` operations aligns with the `AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE` rule. This rule should be prioritized as it directly addresses the simplification of aggregate operations.\n\n2. **CORRELATE Operator Rules**: The suggestion to transform `IN` sub-queries into `LEFT JOIN` operations with aggregates aligns with the `FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE` rule.

Additionally, simplifying conditions using logical rules aligns with the `FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS` rule. The `FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE` rule is also relevant for transforming sub-queries. Therefore, the order should prioritize `FILTER_INTO_JOIN` and `FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS` first, followed by `FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE`.\n\n4. **JOIN Operator Rules**: The suggestion to move conditions to the `ON` clause aligns with the `FILTER_INTO_JOIN` rule, which should be prioritized.\n\n5. **PROJECT Operator Rules**: The suggestion to simplify the query by removing unnecessary projections aligns with the `AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE` rule. The `SORT_PROJECT_TRANSPOSE` rule is not directly related to the suggestions, so it can be deprioritized.\n\n6. **SORT Operator Rules**: The suggestion to optimize `LIMIT` and `ORDER BY` aligns with the `SORT_PROJECT_TRANSPOSE` rule, which should be prioritized.\n\nBased on these analyses, the rules are organized as follows:\n\nAGGREGATE Operator Rules: ```python\n[\n    "AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE"\n]\n```\n\nCORRELATE Operator Rules: ```python\n[\n    "FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE"\n]\n```\n\nFILTER Operator Rules: ```python\n[\n    "FILTER_INTO_JOIN",\n    "FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS",\n    "FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE"\n]\n```\n\nJOIN Operator Rules: ```python\n[\n    "FILTER_INTO_JOIN"\n]\n```\n\nPROJECT Operator Rules: ```python\n[\n    "AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE",\n    "SORT_PROJECT_TRANSPOSE"\n]\n```\n\nSORT Operator Rules: ```python\n[\n    "SORT_PROJECT_TRANSPOSE"\n]\n```', 'time': 6.848056077957153}

The filter\'s expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there\'s a matching row in the non-preserving side\'s table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned."""\n\n### Rule AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: - The SQL query contains a `GROUP BY` clause that groups by simple columns (no expressions in the `GROUP BY` list).\n- The aggregate functions in the `SELECT` clause operate directly on columns (no expressions inside the aggregate functions).\n- The `SELECT` clause only contains the columns used in the `GROUP BY` clause and the aggregates without any transformations or additional expressions.\n**Transformations**: - Directly apply the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions to the data source referred to in the `FROM` clause of the inner query before the projection.\n- Eliminate the outer projection layer if it only renames the columns without transforming them.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: - The `SELECT` clause of an outer query precisely matches the columns used in the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions of an inner query, without any column transformations or renamings.\n- The inner `SELECT` only serves as a passthrough for these columns.\n**Transformations**: - Remove the inner `SELECT` layer, directly applying the aggregate functions and `GROUP BY` to the original data source."""\n\n### Rule FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains conditions that can be statically determined as always true (e.g., constant expressions like `1=1` or tautologies based on the column data types and constraints), then these conditions don\'t affect the result set.\n**Transformations**: Remove such conditions from the WHERE clause. If this results in an empty WHERE clause, remove the WHERE clause entirely.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause simplifies to conditions that are always false or involve comparisons with NULL in a way that the outcome is always false or NULL (e.g., `column != column` or `1=0`), indicating no rows can satisfy the filter.\n**Transformations**: Replace the query with one that selects no rows. This could be represented in different ways based on the SQL dialect. One universal method might be selecting from a dual table with a false condition.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains complex conditions that can be simplified based on known constraints, constants, or through logical simplification (e.g., `column IS NOT NULL AND column IS NOT NULL` simplifies to `column IS NOT NULL`).\n**Transformations**: Simplify the conditions according to logical rules and known constraints.

This might not translate directly into SQL syntax without additional sub-query or DISTINCT aggregation."""\n\n### Rule SORT_PROJECT_TRANSPOSE:\n"""**Conditions**: If a SQL query executes a sort operation on columns that are directly referenced in the SELECT list or through expressions that are strictly monotonic transformations of these columns, and the sort operation directly follows these projections (SELECT statements), the sort operation can be pushed to operate directly on the table (FROM clause) before the projection.\n**Transformations**: 1. Check Compatibility: Ensure both sort and project (SELECT and ORDER BY clauses) involve compatible operations that relate directly to the raw column data or involve monotonic transformations.\n2. Analyze Order By Fields: Verify that each column in the ORDER BY clause is directly represented in the SELECT list or is a derived column through a monotonic transformation (e.g., casting integers to floats where the order is preserved).\n3. Adjust SQL Query: Rewrite the query so that sorting (ORDER BY clause) is applied to the raw table data in the FROM clause rather than after the projection. This might involve introducing a subquery or CTE (Common Table Expression) where the sorting is applied first, followed by the projections.\n4. Optimize Projection: Ensure that the SELECT list in the outer query matches the original projection, applying on top of the sorted data now."""\n\nRule Subset Sequences:\n### Rule Sequence 1: ["AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE"]\n\n### Rule Sequence 2: ["FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE"]\n\n### Rule Sequence 3: ["FILTER_INTO_JOIN", "FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS", "FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE"]\n\n### Rule Sequence 4: ["FILTER_INTO_JOIN"]\n\n### Rule Sequence 5: ["AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE", "SORT_PROJECT_TRANSPOSE"]\n\n### Rule Sequence 6: ["SORT_PROJECT_TRANSPOSE"]'}], 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'stream': False, 'temperature': 0.1}}

Firstly, conditions in the `WHERE` clause that only involve columns from the `ss_items`, `cs_items`, and `ws_items` tables can be moved to the `ON` clause of `INNER JOIN` operations. This reduces the dataset size before the join, enhancing performance. Secondly, the query\'s use of `IN` sub-queries to filter dates can be transformed into `LEFT JOIN` operations with an aggregate function like `SINGLE_VALUE`, which ensures a single value for the join condition. This approach leverages joins and aggregates, improving performance and readability by avoiding nested sub-queries. Lastly, subqueries with `IN` predicates in the `WHERE` clause of the CTEs can be optimized using semi-join techniques. By transforming these subqueries into semi-joins, the query can reduce the result set size early in processing, discarding non-matching rows sooner and thus enhancing performance. These strategies collectively aim to streamline the query execution process, making it more efficient and easier to understand."""\n\n### Suggestion 2:\n"""The provided SQL query can be optimized using two main rewrite strategies. The first strategy involves simplifying the query by removing unnecessary inner `SELECT` layers within the common table expressions (`ss_items`, `cs_items`, `ws_items`). These layers were initially used as passthroughs for columns involved in `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions, but they can be eliminated to allow direct application of these operations on the data sources (`store_sales`, `catalog_sales`, `web_sales`, `item`, `date_dim`, `customer`). This simplification reduces query complexity and enhances performance by removing redundant projections and directly aggregating data from the joined tables. The second strategy focuses on optimizing the `GROUP BY` operations by rearranging them to occur at the earliest possible stage. By pre-aggregating data in subqueries before any joins, the size of intermediate datasets is reduced, minimizing the workload on subsequent join operations and improving overall execution speed and efficiency. Together, these strategies streamline the query, making it more efficient and performant."""\n\n### Suggestion 3:\n"""The SQL query changes can be explained as follows: The original query contained BETWEEN conditions that specified ranges for `ss_list_price`, `i_manager_id`, and `c_birth_year`. These conditions were simplified using the SEARCH predicate, which is a more efficient way to express range queries in SQL. This transformation aligns with Case 3 of the query rewrite rule, which aims to simplify conditions based on logical rules and known constraints. By converting the BETWEEN conditions into SEARCH predicates, the query becomes more efficient, potentially improving performance by allowing the database engine to better utilize indexes and optimize the execution plan."""\n\n### Suggestion 4:\n"""The query uses `LIMIT` and `ORDER BY`, which can be optimized by ensuring that the database engine stops the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained.

This might not translate directly into SQL syntax without additional sub-query or DISTINCT aggregation."""\n\n### Rule SORT_PROJECT_TRANSPOSE:\n"""**Conditions**: If a SQL query executes a sort operation on columns that are directly referenced in the SELECT list or through expressions that are strictly monotonic transformations of these columns, and the sort operation directly follows these projections (SELECT statements), the sort operation can be pushed to operate directly on the table (FROM clause) before the projection.\n**Transformations**: 1. Check Compatibility: Ensure both sort and project (SELECT and ORDER BY clauses) involve compatible operations that relate directly to the raw column data or involve monotonic transformations.\n2. Analyze Order By Fields: Verify that each column in the ORDER BY clause is directly represented in the SELECT list or is a derived column through a monotonic transformation (e.g., casting integers to floats where the order is preserved).\n3. Adjust SQL Query: Rewrite the query so that sorting (ORDER BY clause) is applied to the raw table data in the FROM clause rather than after the projection. This might involve introducing a subquery or CTE (Common Table Expression) where the sorting is applied first, followed by the projections.\n4. Optimize Projection: Ensure that the SELECT list in the outer query matches the original projection, applying on top of the sorted data now."""\n\nRule Subset Sequences:\n### Rule Sequence 1: ["AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE"]\n\n### Rule Sequence 2: ["FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE"]\n\n### Rule Sequence 3: ["FILTER_INTO_JOIN", "FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS", "FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE"]\n\n### Rule Sequence 4: ["FILTER_INTO_JOIN"]\n\n### Rule Sequence 5: ["AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE", "SORT_PROJECT_TRANSPOSE"]\n\n### Rule Sequence 6: ["SORT_PROJECT_TRANSPOSE"]'}], 'response': 'To optimize the given SQL query, we need to apply the provided query rewrite rules in a sequence that maximizes efficiency.

Firstly, conditions in the `WHERE` clause that only involve columns from the `ss_items`, `cs_items`, and `ws_items` tables can be moved to the `ON` clause of `INNER JOIN` operations. This reduces the dataset size before the join, enhancing performance. Secondly, the query\'s use of `IN` sub-queries to filter dates can be transformed into `LEFT JOIN` operations with an aggregate function like `SINGLE_VALUE`, which ensures a single value for the join condition. This approach leverages joins and aggregates, improving performance and readability by avoiding nested sub-queries. Lastly, subqueries with `IN` predicates in the `WHERE` clause of the CTEs can be optimized using semi-join techniques. By transforming these subqueries into semi-joins, the query can reduce the result set size early in processing, discarding non-matching rows sooner and thus enhancing performance. These strategies collectively aim to streamline the query execution process, making it more efficient and easier to understand."""\n\n### Suggestion 2:\n"""The provided SQL query can be optimized using two main rewrite strategies. The first strategy involves simplifying the query by removing unnecessary inner `SELECT` layers within the common table expressions (`ss_items`, `cs_items`, `ws_items`). These layers were initially used as passthroughs for columns involved in `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions, but they can be eliminated to allow direct application of these operations on the data sources (`store_sales`, `catalog_sales`, `web_sales`, `item`, `date_dim`, `customer`). This simplification reduces query complexity and enhances performance by removing redundant projections and directly aggregating data from the joined tables. The second strategy focuses on optimizing the `GROUP BY` operations by rearranging them to occur at the earliest possible stage. By pre-aggregating data in subqueries before any joins, the size of intermediate datasets is reduced, minimizing the workload on subsequent join operations and improving overall execution speed and efficiency. Together, these strategies streamline the query, making it more efficient and performant."""\n\n### Suggestion 3:\n"""The SQL query changes can be explained as follows: The original query contained BETWEEN conditions that specified ranges for `ss_list_price`, `i_manager_id`, and `c_birth_year`. These conditions were simplified using the SEARCH predicate, which is a more efficient way to express range queries in SQL. This transformation aligns with Case 3 of the query rewrite rule, which aims to simplify conditions based on logical rules and known constraints. By converting the BETWEEN conditions into SEARCH predicates, the query becomes more efficient, potentially improving performance by allowing the database engine to better utilize indexes and optimize the execution plan."""\n\n### Suggestion 4:\n"""The query uses `LIMIT` and `ORDER BY`, which can be optimized by ensuring that the database engine stops the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained. This avoids full table sorts and reduces resource usage. The current query already leverages these optimizations by combining `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY`, ensuring efficient retrieval of the top 100 rows based on the specified order criteria."""\n\nQuery Rewrite Rules:\n### Rule FILTER_INTO_JOIN:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: This SQL query rewrite rule applies when a filter condition is placed on the result set of an INNER JOIN operation. The filter\'s expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there\'s a matching row in the non-preserving side\'s table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned."""\n\n### Rule AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: - The SQL query contains a `GROUP BY` clause that groups by simple columns (no expressions in the `GROUP BY` list).\n- The aggregate functions in the `SELECT` clause operate directly on columns (no expressions inside the aggregate functions).\n- The `SELECT` clause only contains the columns used in the `GROUP BY` clause and the aggregates without any transformations or additional expressions.\n**Transformations**: - Directly apply the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions to the data source referred to in the `FROM` clause of the inner query before the projection.\n- Eliminate the outer projection layer if it only renames the columns without transforming them.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: - The `SELECT` clause of an outer query precisely matches the columns used in the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions of an inner query, without any column transformations or renamings.\n- The inner `SELECT` only serves as a passthrough for these columns.\n**Transformations**: - Remove the inner `SELECT` layer, directly applying the aggregate functions and `GROUP BY` to the original data source."""\n\n### Rule FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains conditions that can be statically determined as always true (e.g., constant expressions like `1=1` or tautologies based on the column data types and constraints), then these conditions don\'t affect the result set.\n**Transformations**: Remove such conditions from the WHERE clause. If this results in an empty WHERE clause, remove the WHERE clause entirely.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause simplifies to conditions that are always false or involve comparisons with NULL in a way that the outcome is always false or NULL (e.g., `column != column` or `1=0`), indicating no rows can satisfy the filter.\n**Transformations**: Replace the query with one that selects no rows. This could be represented in different ways based on the SQL dialect. One universal method might be selecting from a dual table with a false condition.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains complex conditions that can be simplified based on known constraints, constants, or through logical simplification (e.g., `column IS NOT NULL AND column IS NOT NULL` simplifies to `column IS NOT NULL`).\n**Transformations**: Simplify the conditions according to logical rules and known constraints. Remove redundancy and unnecessary complexity."""\n\n### Rule FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: The query contains a scalar sub-query within the WHERE clause.\n**Transformations**: The scalar sub-query should be transformed into a LEFT JOIN operation with an aggregate function on the column(s) being selected in the sub-query. The JOIN condition uses the correlation ID (the matching column(s) in both outer and sub-query).\n  - Original Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 WHERE column = (SELECT AGG_FUNCTION(column2) FROM table2 WHERE table1.join_column = table2.join_column)\n  - Transformed Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 LEFT JOIN (SELECT join_column, AGG_FUNCTION(column2) AS agg_result FROM table2 GROUP BY join_column) AS sub_query ON table1.join_column = sub_query.join_column WHERE column = sub_query.agg_result\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: The query contains `IN`, `EXISTS`, or `UNIQUE` sub-queries within the WHERE clause that are correlated with the outer query.\n**Transformations**: - For `IN` Sub-queries: Replace the `IN` clause with a JOIN operation and a WHERE condition that checks for non-null values on the side of the sub-query.\n    - Original Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 WHERE column IN (SELECT column2 FROM table2 WHERE table1.join_column = table2.join_column)\n    - Transformed Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.join_column = table2.join_column WHERE table2.column2 IS NOT NULL\n  - For `EXISTS` Sub-queries: Convert the `EXISTS` condition into a JOIN operation, using WHERE to filter rows that match the JOIN condition.\n    - Original Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM table2 WHERE table1.join_column = table2.join_class)\n    - Transformed Query Structure: SELECT DISTINCT table1.* FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.join_column = table2.join_column\n  - For `UNIQUE` Sub-queries: Since `UNIQUE` requires a bit more complex handling not directly mappable to a standard JOIN, it should be considered a special case where the goal is to ensure that rows from the outer query match a unique set in the sub-query. This might not translate directly into SQL syntax without additional sub-query or DISTINCT aggregation."""\n\n### Rule SORT_PROJECT_TRANSPOSE:\n"""**Conditions**: If a SQL query executes a sort operation on columns that are directly referenced in the SELECT list or through expressions that are strictly monotonic transformations of these columns, and the sort operation directly follows these projections (SELECT statements), the sort operation can be pushed to operate directly on the table (FROM clause) before the projection.\n**Transformations**: 1. Check Compatibility: Ensure both sort and project (SELECT and ORDER BY clauses) involve compatible operations that relate directly to the raw column data or involve monotonic transformations.\n2. Analyze Order By Fields: Verify that each column in the ORDER BY clause is directly represented in the SELECT list or is a derived column through a monotonic transformation (e.g., casting integers to floats where the order is preserved).\n3. Adjust SQL Query: Rewrite the query so that sorting (ORDER BY clause) is applied to the raw table data in the FROM clause rather than after the projection. This might involve introducing a subquery or CTE (Common Table Expression) where the sorting is applied first, followed by the projections.\n4. Optimize Projection: Ensure that the SELECT list in the outer query matches the original projection, applying on top of the sorted data now."""\n\nArranged Rule Sequence: ["FILTER_INTO_JOIN", "FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS", "FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE", "AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE", "SORT_PROJECT_TRANSPOSE"]\n\nUtilized Rules: ["FILTER_INTO_JOIN", "FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE", "AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE", "SORT_PROJECT_TRANSPOSE"]\n\nUnutilized Rules: ["FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS"]'}], 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'stream': False, 'temperature': 0.1}}

Firstly, conditions in the `WHERE` clause that only involve columns from the `ss_items`, `cs_items`, and `ws_items` tables can be moved to the `ON` clause of `INNER JOIN` operations. This reduces the dataset size before the join, enhancing performance. Secondly, the query\'s use of `IN` sub-queries to filter dates can be transformed into `LEFT JOIN` operations with an aggregate function like `SINGLE_VALUE`, which ensures a single value for the join condition. This approach leverages joins and aggregates, improving performance and readability by avoiding nested sub-queries. Lastly, subqueries with `IN` predicates in the `WHERE` clause of the CTEs can be optimized using semi-join techniques. By transforming these subqueries into semi-joins, the query can reduce the result set size early in processing, discarding non-matching rows sooner and thus enhancing performance. These strategies collectively aim to streamline the query execution process, making it more efficient and easier to understand."""\n\n### Suggestion 2:\n"""The provided SQL query can be optimized using two main rewrite strategies. The first strategy involves simplifying the query by removing unnecessary inner `SELECT` layers within the common table expressions (`ss_items`, `cs_items`, `ws_items`). These layers were initially used as passthroughs for columns involved in `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions, but they can be eliminated to allow direct application of these operations on the data sources (`store_sales`, `catalog_sales`, `web_sales`, `item`, `date_dim`, `customer`). This simplification reduces query complexity and enhances performance by removing redundant projections and directly aggregating data from the joined tables. The second strategy focuses on optimizing the `GROUP BY` operations by rearranging them to occur at the earliest possible stage. By pre-aggregating data in subqueries before any joins, the size of intermediate datasets is reduced, minimizing the workload on subsequent join operations and improving overall execution speed and efficiency. Together, these strategies streamline the query, making it more efficient and performant."""\n\n### Suggestion 3:\n"""The SQL query changes can be explained as follows: The original query contained BETWEEN conditions that specified ranges for `ss_list_price`, `i_manager_id`, and `c_birth_year`. These conditions were simplified using the SEARCH predicate, which is a more efficient way to express range queries in SQL. This transformation aligns with Case 3 of the query rewrite rule, which aims to simplify conditions based on logical rules and known constraints. By converting the BETWEEN conditions into SEARCH predicates, the query becomes more efficient, potentially improving performance by allowing the database engine to better utilize indexes and optimize the execution plan."""\n\n### Suggestion 4:\n"""The query uses `LIMIT` and `ORDER BY`, which can be optimized by ensuring that the database engine stops the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained. This avoids full table sorts and reduces resource usage. The current query already leverages these optimizations by combining `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY`, ensuring efficient retrieval of the top 100 rows based on the specified order criteria."""\n\nQuery Rewrite Rules:\n### Rule FILTER_INTO_JOIN:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: This SQL query rewrite rule applies when a filter condition is placed on the result set of an INNER JOIN operation. The filter\'s expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there\'s a matching row in the non-preserving side\'s table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned."""\n\n### Rule AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: - The SQL query contains a `GROUP BY` clause that groups by simple columns (no expressions in the `GROUP BY` list).\n- The aggregate functions in the `SELECT` clause operate directly on columns (no expressions inside the aggregate functions).\n- The `SELECT` clause only contains the columns used in the `GROUP BY` clause and the aggregates without any transformations or additional expressions.\n**Transformations**: - Directly apply the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions to the data source referred to in the `FROM` clause of the inner query before the projection.\n- Eliminate the outer projection layer if it only renames the columns without transforming them.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: - The `SELECT` clause of an outer query precisely matches the columns used in the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions of an inner query, without any column transformations or renamings.\n- The inner `SELECT` only serves as a passthrough for these columns.\n**Transformations**: - Remove the inner `SELECT` layer, directly applying the aggregate functions and `GROUP BY` to the original data source."""\n\n### Rule FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains conditions that can be statically determined as always true (e.g., constant expressions like `1=1` or tautologies based on the column data types and constraints), then these conditions don\'t affect the result set.\n**Transformations**: Remove such conditions from the WHERE clause. If this results in an empty WHERE clause, remove the WHERE clause entirely.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause simplifies to conditions that are always false or involve comparisons with NULL in a way that the outcome is always false or NULL (e.g., `column != column` or `1=0`), indicating no rows can satisfy the filter.\n**Transformations**: Replace the query with one that selects no rows. This could be represented in different ways based on the SQL dialect. One universal method might be selecting from a dual table with a false condition.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains complex conditions that can be simplified based on known constraints, constants, or through logical simplification (e.g., `column IS NOT NULL AND column IS NOT NULL` simplifies to `column IS NOT NULL`).\n**Transformations**: Simplify the conditions according to logical rules and known constraints. Remove redundancy and unnecessary complexity."""\n\n### Rule FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: The query contains a scalar sub-query within the WHERE clause.\n**Transformations**: The scalar sub-query should be transformed into a LEFT JOIN operation with an aggregate function on the column(s) being selected in the sub-query. The JOIN condition uses the correlation ID (the matching column(s) in both outer and sub-query).\n  - Original Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 WHERE column = (SELECT AGG_FUNCTION(column2) FROM table2 WHERE table1.join_column = table2.join_column)\n  - Transformed Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 LEFT JOIN (SELECT join_column, AGG_FUNCTION(column2) AS agg_result FROM table2 GROUP BY join_column) AS sub_query ON table1.join_column = sub_query.join_column WHERE column = sub_query.agg_result\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: The query contains `IN`, `EXISTS`, or `UNIQUE` sub-queries within the WHERE clause that are correlated with the outer query.\n**Transformations**: - For `IN` Sub-queries: Replace the `IN` clause with a JOIN operation and a WHERE condition that checks for non-null values on the side of the sub-query.\n    - Original Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 WHERE column IN (SELECT column2 FROM table2 WHERE table1.join_column = table2.join_column)\n    - Transformed Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.join_column = table2.join_column WHERE table2.column2 IS NOT NULL\n  - For `EXISTS` Sub-queries: Convert the `EXISTS` condition into a JOIN operation, using WHERE to filter rows that match the JOIN condition.\n    - Original Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM table2 WHERE table1.join_column = table2.join_class)\n    - Transformed Query Structure: SELECT DISTINCT table1.* FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.join_column = table2.join_column\n  - For `UNIQUE` Sub-queries: Since `UNIQUE` requires a bit more complex handling not directly mappable to a standard JOIN, it should be considered a special case where the goal is to ensure that rows from the outer query match a unique set in the sub-query. This might not translate directly into SQL syntax without additional sub-query or DISTINCT aggregation."""\n\n### Rule SORT_PROJECT_TRANSPOSE:\n"""**Conditions**: If a SQL query executes a sort operation on columns that are directly referenced in the SELECT list or through expressions that are strictly monotonic transformations of these columns, and the sort operation directly follows these projections (SELECT statements), the sort operation can be pushed to operate directly on the table (FROM clause) before the projection.\n**Transformations**: 1. Check Compatibility: Ensure both sort and project (SELECT and ORDER BY clauses) involve compatible operations that relate directly to the raw column data or involve monotonic transformations.\n2. Analyze Order By Fields: Verify that each column in the ORDER BY clause is directly represented in the SELECT list or is a derived column through a monotonic transformation (e.g., casting integers to floats where the order is preserved).\n3. Adjust SQL Query: Rewrite the query so that sorting (ORDER BY clause) is applied to the raw table data in the FROM clause rather than after the projection. This might involve introducing a subquery or CTE (Common Table Expression) where the sorting is applied first, followed by the projections.\n4. Optimize Projection: Ensure that the SELECT list in the outer query matches the original projection, applying on top of the sorted data now."""\n\nArranged Rule Sequence: ["FILTER_INTO_JOIN", "FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS", "FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE", "AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE", "SORT_PROJECT_TRANSPOSE"]\n\nUtilized Rules: ["FILTER_INTO_JOIN", "FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE", "AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE", "SORT_PROJECT_TRANSPOSE"]\n\nUnutilized Rules: ["FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS"]'}], 'response': 'Step 1: The unutilized rule "FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS" should be examined to see if it matches any of the provided query rewrite suggestions.
