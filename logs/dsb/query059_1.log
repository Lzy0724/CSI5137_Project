When the `LIMIT` clause is used to fetch a specified number of rows.\n2. When `ORDER BY` is used in conjunction with `LIMIT` to sort and limit the number of rows retrieved, particularly when sorting can leverage an index.\n3. When `DISTINCT` is used along with `LIMIT` to quickly identify and return unique rows without scanning the full dataset.\n4. During the use of `GROUP BY`, where optimization might involve sorting or traversing indexes in order to efficiently compute group values without processing the entire dataset.\n5. When sorting a specific number of rows from a single table based on non-indexed columns, utilizing in-memory sorting (`filesort`) techniques.\n**Transformations**: The specific SQL transformations that emerge from applying these optimization rules are:\n1. Combining `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY` encourages the database engine to stop the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained, avoiding full table sorts.\n2. Using `LIMIT` with `DISTINCT` leads to an early termination of the search for unique rows as soon as the needed amount is gathered, reducing time and resources spent on scanning the entire dataset.\n3. In the context of `GROUP BY`, optimizations may include indexing strategies or modifications to the way sorting is handled, such as employing `filesort` mechanisms that do not require temporary tables, ensuring that the database engine processes only the necessary data for group computations.\n4. Efficiencies are gained by encouraging the use of indexed columns with `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT`, making queries more efficient by reducing the cost associated with sorting and filtering operations.\n"""\nRule 4:\n"""\n**Conditions**: The SQL query rewrite rule applies when there are:\n- Functions or operations (especially deterministic ones) within the SELECT, WHERE, JOIN conditions, or any part of the query that is executed multiple times for the same row.\n- The presence of potentially computationally expensive operations or function calls that are not dependent on the data of the specific row and thus can be optimized.\n**Transformations**: 1. Move repeated function calls or operations outside of loops, if applicable. For example, if a function that generates a calculated value based on constants or parameters (not row-specific data) is being called in a loop, calculate the value once before the loop and store the result for reuse.\n   \n2. Replace inline functions in the SELECT or WHERE clause with a pre-calculated column if the function is deterministic and the input data does not change frequently. This might involve:\n   - Creating a temporary table that includes the results of the expensive function calls.\n   - Using a subquery or a Common Table Expression (CTE) that calculates the value once and then joins it with the main query.\n   \n3. When using aggregate functions that are called multiple times with the same parameters, consider storing the result in a variable or a temporary table, especially if the data set is large.\n\n4. Avoid using functions on indexed columns in the WHERE clause. This prevents the database from using the index efficiently. If a function must be used, consider creating a computed column that pre-calculates the function\'s result and index that column instead.\n\n5. If possible, simplify expressions and calculations to reduce their complexity and execution time. This might involve algebraic simplification or breaking down complex calculations into simpler parts that can be calculated separately and then combined.\n\nExample:\nOriginal Query:\n```sql\nSELECT id, name, expensive_function(column) as expensive_result\nFROM table\nWHERE expensive_function(column) > 100;\n```\n\nTransformed Query using a CTE:\n```sql\nWITH PreCalculated AS (\n  SELECT id, name, column, expensive_function(column) as expensive_result\n  FROM table\n)\nSELECT id, name, expensive_sel as expensive_result\nFROM PreCalculated\nWHERE expensive_result > 100;\n```\n"""\nRule 5:\n"""\n**Conditions**: The rule applies when the original SQL query performs multiple scans or joins on the same table to retrieve different attributes for certain conditions, or when the query structure results in redundant data processing and complexity that could be reduced.\n**Transformations**: - Combine multiple joins into a single join operation by using `CASE` statements to conditionally select different attributes from the table in one pass. \n- Use the `COALESCE` function in conjunction with `CASE` statements to efficiently merge conditional attributes into distinct columns based on specific criteria without the need for additional joins.\n- Optimize the selection of conditional attributes by integrating `GROUP BY` with aggregate functions like `MAX` within `CASE` statements, thus condensing the result set to only the necessary data and avoiding needless retrieval and processing steps.\n- The overall transformation leads to a single, more efficient query that accomplishes the tasks of multiple, less efficient operations, improving performance, and simplifying the query for better readability and maintenance.\n"""'}], 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'stream': False, 'temperature': 0.1}}

The filter's expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there's a matching row in the non-preserving side's table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned.\n```\n\nLogical Plan Changes After Rewrite: ```\n  LogicalSort(sort0=[$0(s_store_name)], sort1=[$1(s_store_id)], sort2=[$2(d_week_seq)], dir0=[ASC], dir1=[ASC], dir2=[ASC], fetch=[100])\r\n    LogicalProject(s_store_name1=[$0(s_store_name)], s_store_id1=[$2(s_store_id)], d_week_seq1=[$1(d_week_seq)], EXPR$3=[/($3, $13)], EXPR$4=[/($4, $14)], EXPR$5=[/($5, $15)], EXPR$6=[/($6, $16)], EXPR$7=[/($7, $17)], EXPR$8=[/($8, $18)], EXPR$9=[/($9, $19)])\r\n-     LogicalFilter(condition=[AND(=($2(s_store_id), $12(s_store_id)), =($1(d_week_seq), -($11(d_week_seq), 52)))])\r\n?

The SQL query must contain an aggregate function (`SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT`, etc.) that operates on a CASE expression with a format resembling `CASE WHEN <condition> THEN <expression> END`.\n2. This CASE expression must be the sole argument to the aggregate function.\n3. The aggregate function must not be part of a more complex expression within the `SELECT` clause (i.e., it can be directly transformed).\n**Transformations**: - Identify the CASE expression within the aggregate function in the `SELECT` clause.

The SQL query must contain an aggregate function (`SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT`, etc.) that operates on a CASE expression with a format resembling `CASE WHEN <condition> THEN <expression> END`.\n2. This CASE expression must be the sole argument to the aggregate function.\n3. The aggregate function must not be part of a more complex expression within the `SELECT` clause (i.e., it can be directly transformed).\n**Transformations**: - Identify the CASE expression within the aggregate function in the `SELECT` clause. Confirm it has the required structure (`CASE WHEN <condition> THEN <expression> END`).\n- Rewrite the aggregate function to remove the CASE expression and incorporate the filtering directly. Use the SQL `FILTER` clause to specify the same condition found in the original CASE expression.\n- Adjust the `SELECT` clause to include the updated aggregate function, now with the `FILTER (WHERE <condition>)` clause.\n```\n\nLogical Plan Changes After Rewrite: ```\n  LogicalSort(sort0=[$0(s_store_name)], sort1=[$1(s_store_id)], sort2=[$2(d_week_seq)], dir0=[ASC], dir1=[ASC], dir2=[ASC], fetch=[100])\r\n-   LogicalProject(s_store_name1=[$0(s_store_name)], s_store_id1=[$2(s_store_id)], d_week_seq1=[$1(d_week_seq)], EXPR$3=[/($3, $13)], EXPR$4=[/($4, $14)], EXPR$5=[/($5, $15)], EXPR$6=[/($6, $16)], EXPR$7=[/($7, $17)], EXPR$8=[/($8, $18)], EXPR$9=[/($9, $19)])\r\n+   LogicalProject(s_store_name1=[$0(s_store_name)], s_store_id1=[$2(s_store_id)], d_week_seq1=[$1(d_week_seq)], EXPR$3=[/($3(ss_sales_price), $13(ss_sales_price))], EXPR$4=[/($4(ss_sales_price), $14(ss_sales_price))], EXPR$5=[/($5(ss_sales_price), $15(ss_sales_price))], EXPR$6=[/($6(ss_sales_price), $16(ss_sales_price))], EXPR$7=[/($7(ss_sales_price), $17(ss_sales_price))], EXPR$8=[/($8(ss_sales_price), $18(ss_sales_price))], EXPR$9=[/($9(ss_sales_price), $19(ss_sales_price))])\r\n      LogicalFilter(condition=[AND(=($2(s_store_id), $12(s_store_id)), =($1(d_week_seq), -($11(d_week_seq), 52)))])\r\n        LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n-         LogicalProject(s_store_name1=[$14(s_store_name)], d_week_seq1=[$0(d_week_seq)], s_store_id1=[$10(s_store_id)], sun_sales1=[$2], mon_sales1=[$3], tue_sales1=[$4], wed_sales1=[$5], thu_sales1=[$6], fri_sales1=[$7], sat_sales1=[$8])\r\n+         LogicalProject(s_store_name1=[$14(s_store_name)], d_week_seq1=[$0(d_week_seq)], s_store_id1=[$10(s_store_id)], sun_sales1=[$2(ss_sales_price)], mon_sales1=[$3(ss_sales_price)], tue_sales1=[$4(ss_sales_price)], wed_sales1=[$5(ss_sales_price)], thu_sales1=[$6(ss_sales_price)], fri_sales1=[$7(ss_sales_price)], sat_sales1=[$8(ss_sales_price)])\r\n?

Specifically, the `SUM` functions that previously had `CASE WHEN <condition> THEN ss_sales_price ELSE NULL END` have been rewritten to `SUM(ss_sales_price) FILTER (WHERE <condition>)`.\n\nStep 2: Parsing the logical plan changes, we see that the original SQL query contained several `SUM` functions with `CASE` expressions:\n- `SUM(CASE WHEN (d_day_name='Sunday') THEN ss_sales_price ELSE NULL END) sun_sales`\n- `SUM(CASE WHEN (d_day_name='Monday') THEN ss_sales_price ELSE NULL END) mon_sales`\n- And similarly for other days of the week.\n\nThese have been transformed to:\n- `SUM(ss_sales_price) FILTER (WHERE d_day_name='Sunday') sun_sales`\n- `SUM(ss_sales_price) FILTER (WHERE d_day_name='Monday') mon_sales`\n- And similarly for other days of the week.\n\nStep 3: The query rewrite rule contains a single case that applies when an aggregate function operates on a `CASE` expression with a specific structure. The parsed SQL query changes match this case, as the original query's `SUM` functions used `CASE` expressions that fit the required pattern.\n\nStep 4: The SQL query changes can be explained as follows: The original query used `SUM` functions with `CASE` expressions to conditionally sum `ss_sales_price` based on the day of the week. The rewrite rule identified these `CASE` expressions and transformed them into `SUM` functions with a `FILTER` clause. This transformation simplifies the query by directly applying the condition within the `FILTER` clause, making the query more efficient and easier to read. For example, the transformation from `SUM(CASE WHEN (d_day_name='Sunday') THEN ss_sales_price ELSE NULL END)` to `SUM(ss_sales_price) FILTER (WHERE d_day_name='Sunday')` achieves the same result but in a more streamlined manner.", 'time': 4.519284963607788}

If this results in an empty WHERE clause, remove the WHERE clause entirely.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause simplifies to conditions that are always false or involve comparisons with NULL in a way that the outcome is always false or NULL (e.g., `column != column` or `1=0`), indicating no rows can satisfy the filter.\n**Transformations**: Replace the query with one that selects no rows.

Specifically, the expressions involving multiplication and division in the filter conditions have been simplified. The expressions `*(54, 0.01)` and `*(74, 0.01)` have been replaced with their evaluated results, `0.54` and `0.74`, respectively. Additionally, the `OR` conditions for `s_state` have been transformed into a `SEARCH` condition, which is a more efficient representation.\n\nStep 2: Parsing these changes into SQL query details, we observe the following:\n- The condition `ss_sales_price / ss_list_price BETWEEN 54 * 0.01 AND 74 * 0.01` in the original SQL query has been simplified to `ss_sales_price / ss_list_price BETWEEN 0.54 AND 0.74`.\n- The `OR` condition for `s_state` in the WHERE clause has been transformed into a `SEARCH` condition, which is a more efficient way to handle multiple equality checks.\n\nStep 3: The query rewrite rule contains multiple cases. In this scenario, the changes match Case 3 of the query rewrite rule. This case involves simplifying complex conditions based on known constraints or logical simplifications. The multiplication expressions were simplified to their constant results, and the `OR` condition was optimized using a `SEARCH` condition.\n\nStep 4: The SQL query changes can be explained as follows:\n- The original condition `ss_sales_price / ss_list_price BETWEEN 54 * 0.01 AND 74 * 0.01` was simplified by evaluating the constant expressions `54 * 0.01` and `74 * 0.01` to `0.54` and `0.74`, respectively. This simplification reduces computational overhead and improves query performance.\n- The `OR` condition for `s_state` was transformed into a `SEARCH` condition, which is a more efficient way to handle multiple equality checks. This transformation reduces redundancy and unnecessary complexity in the query, aligning with the goal of Case 3 to simplify conditions based on logical rules and known constraints.', 'time': 4.976154804229736}

The filter's expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there's a matching row in the non-preserving side's table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned.\n```\n\nLogical Plan Changes After Rewrite: ```\n  LogicalSort(sort0=[$0(s_store_name)], sort1=[$1(s_store_id)], sort2=[$2(d_week_seq)], dir0=[ASC], dir1=[ASC], dir2=[ASC], fetch=[100])\r\n    LogicalProject(s_store_name1=[$0(s_store_name)], s_store_id1=[$2(s_store_id)], d_week_seq1=[$1(d_week_seq)], EXPR$3=[/($3, $13)], EXPR$4=[/($4, $14)], EXPR$5=[/($5, $15)], EXPR$6=[/($6, $16)], EXPR$7=[/($7, $17)], EXPR$8=[/($8, $18)], EXPR$9=[/($9, $19)])\r\n-     LogicalFilter(condition=[AND(=($2(s_store_id), $12(s_store_id)), =($1(d_week_seq), -($11(d_week_seq), 52)))])\r\n?

Specifically, the conditions `s_store_id1=s_store_id2` and `d_week_seq1=d_week_seq2-52` were moved from a `LogicalFilter` to a `LogicalJoin` condition. Additionally, the conditions involving `d_week_seq`, `ss_store_sk`, `d_month_seq`, and `s_state` were moved from `LogicalFilter` to `LogicalJoin` conditions in the subqueries.\n\nStep 2: Parsing the logical plan changes, we observe that:\n- The condition `s_store_id1=s_store_id2` and `d_week_seq1=d_week_seq2-52` were originally in the `WHERE` clause of the main query and were moved to the `ON` clause of the `INNER JOIN`.\n- In the subqueries, conditions such as `d.d_week_seq = wss.d_week_seq`, `ss_store_sk = s_store_sk`, `d_month_seq between 1192 and 1192 + 11`, and `s_state in ('CO','GA','MN','ND','NE','PA','TN','WI')` were moved from the `WHERE` clause to the `ON` clause of the `INNER JOIN`.\n\nStep 3: The SQL query rewrite rule contains multiple cases. The changes observed match Case 1, where filter conditions that can be logically associated with only one side of the join are moved into the `ON` clause of the `INNER JOIN`. The conditions `s_store_id1=s_store_id2` and `d_week_seq1=d_week_seq2-52` only involve columns from the subqueries and can be applied to reduce the dataset size before the join.\n\nStep 4: In this query rewrite process, the SQL query was optimized by moving filter conditions that only involve columns from one side of the join into the `ON` clause of the `INNER JOIN`.

When `ORDER BY` is used in conjunction with `LIMIT` to sort and limit the number of rows retrieved, particularly when sorting can leverage an index.\n3. When `DISTINCT` is used along with `LIMIT` to quickly identify and return unique rows without scanning the full dataset.\n4.

Using `LIMIT` with `DISTINCT` leads to an early termination of the search for unique rows as soon as the needed amount is gathered, reducing time and resources spent on scanning the entire dataset.\n3. In the context of `GROUP BY`, optimizations may include indexing strategies or modifications to the way sorting is handled, such as employing `filesort` mechanisms that do not require temporary tables, ensuring that the database engine processes only the necessary data for group computations.\n4. Efficiencies are gained by encouraging the use of indexed columns with `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT`, making queries more efficient by reducing the cost associated with sorting and filtering operations.\n"""\nRule 4:\n"""\n**Conditions**: The SQL query rewrite rule applies when there are:\n- Functions or operations (especially deterministic ones) within the SELECT, WHERE, JOIN conditions, or any part of the query that is executed multiple times for the same row.\n- The presence of potentially computationally expensive operations or function calls that are not dependent on the data of the specific row and thus can be optimized.\n**Transformations**: 1. Move repeated function calls or operations outside of loops, if applicable. For example, if a function that generates a calculated value based on constants or parameters (not row-specific data) is being called in a loop, calculate the value once before the loop and store the result for reuse.\n   \n2. Replace inline functions in the SELECT or WHERE clause with a pre-calculated column if the function is deterministic and the input data does not change frequently. This might involve:\n   - Creating a temporary table that includes the results of the expensive function calls.\n   - Using a subquery or a Common Table Expression (CTE) that calculates the value once and then joins it with the main query.\n   \n3. When using aggregate functions that are called multiple times with the same parameters, consider storing the result in a variable or a temporary table, especially if the data set is large.\n\n4. Avoid using functions on indexed columns in the WHERE clause. This prevents the database from using the index efficiently. If a function must be used, consider creating a computed column that pre-calculates the function\'s result and index that column instead.\n\n5. If possible, simplify expressions and calculations to reduce their complexity and execution time.

05:39:28,427 root INFO Generated queries:
Query 1: In this query rewrite process, the SQL query was optimized by moving filter conditions that only involve columns from one side of the join into the `ON` clause of the `INNER JOIN`. This transformation allows the query to potentially reduce the size of the datasets before performing the join, which can improve performance. Specifically, the conditions `s_store_id1=s_store_id2` and `d_week_seq1=d_week_seq2-52` were moved to the `ON` clause, and similar transformations were applied to the subqueries, aligning with Case 1 of the query rewrite rule.
Query 2: The SQL query changes can be explained as follows: The original query used `SUM` functions with `CASE` expressions to conditionally sum `ss_sales_price` based on the day of the week. The rewrite rule identified these `CASE` expressions and transformed them into `SUM` functions with a `FILTER` clause. This transformation simplifies the query by directly applying the condition within the `FILTER` clause, making the query more efficient and easier to read. For example, the transformation from `SUM(CASE WHEN (d_day_name='Sunday') THEN ss_sales_price ELSE NULL END)` to `SUM(ss_sales_price) FILTER (WHERE d_day_name='Sunday')` achieves the same result but in a more streamlined manner.
Query 3: The SQL query changes can be explained as follows:
- The original condition `ss_sales_price / ss_list_price BETWEEN 54 * 0.01 AND 74 * 0.01` was simplified by evaluating the constant expressions `54 * 0.01` and `74 * 0.01` to `0.54` and `0.74`, respectively. This simplification reduces computational overhead and improves query performance.
- The `OR` condition for `s_state` was transformed into a `SEARCH` condition, which is a more efficient way to handle multiple equality checks. This transformation reduces redundancy and unnecessary complexity in the query, aligning with the goal of Case 3 to simplify conditions based on logical rules and known constraints.
Query 4: The SQL query can be optimized by reordering operations to perform `GROUP BY` earlier. In the CTE `wss`, the `GROUP BY` is already applied before the main query's `JOIN` operations. However, the main query performs two separate subqueries (`y` and `x`) that join `wss`, `store`, and `date_dim`. These subqueries can be optimized by pre-aggregating data before joining, reducing the dataset size early in the execution process. This involves restructuring the query to prioritize grouping operations, minimizing the workload on subsequent operations like `JOIN`, thereby enhancing execution speed and efficiency.
Query 5: The SQL query uses `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY`, which can be optimized by encouraging the database engine to stop the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained. This avoids full table sorts and reduces execution time. The query already uses `ORDER BY s_store_name1, s_store_id1, d_week_seq1` followed by `LIMIT 100`, which aligns with the optimization strategy of Rule 3. Ensuring that the columns used in `ORDER BY` are indexed can further enhance performance.
Query 6: The SQL query performs multiple joins on the same tables (`wss`, `store`, `date_dim`) in the subqueries `y` and `x`. These can be combined into a single join operation by using `CASE` statements to conditionally select different attributes from the tables in one pass. This reduces redundant data processing and simplifies the query structure. By integrating `GROUP BY` with aggregate functions like `MAX` within `CASE` statements, the result set can be condensed to only the necessary data, avoiding needless retrieval and processing steps. This transformation leads to a more efficient query, improving performance and simplifying maintenance.

Query Rewrite 1:
"""In this query rewrite process, the SQL query was optimized by moving filter conditions that only involve columns from one side of the join into the `ON` clause of the `INNER JOIN`. This transformation allows the query to potentially reduce the size of the datasets before performing the join, which can improve performance. Specifically, the conditions `s_store_id1=s_store_id2` and `d_week_seq1=d_week_seq2-52` were moved to the `ON` clause, and similar transformations were applied to the subqueries, aligning with Case 1 of the query rewrite rule."""

Query Rewrite 2:
"""The SQL query changes can be explained as follows: The original query used `SUM` functions with `CASE` expressions to conditionally sum `ss_sales_price` based on the day of the week. The rewrite rule identified these `CASE` expressions and transformed them into `SUM` functions with a `FILTER` clause. This transformation simplifies the query by directly applying the condition within the `FILTER` clause, making the query more efficient and easier to read. For example, the transformation from `SUM(CASE WHEN (d_day_name='Sunday') THEN ss_sales_price ELSE NULL END)` to `SUM(ss_sales_price) FILTER (WHERE d_day_name='Sunday')` achieves the same result but in a more streamlined manner."""

Query Rewrite 3:
"""The SQL query changes can be explained as follows:
- The original condition `ss_sales_price / ss_list_price BETWEEN 54 * 0.01 AND 74 * 0.01` was simplified by evaluating the constant expressions `54 * 0.01` and `74 * 0.01` to `0.54` and `0.74`, respectively. This simplification reduces computational overhead and improves query performance.
- The `OR` condition for `s_state` was transformed into a `SEARCH` condition, which is a more efficient way to handle multiple equality checks. This transformation reduces redundancy and unnecessary complexity in the query, aligning with the goal of Case 3 to simplify conditions based on logical rules and known constraints."""

Query Rewrite 4:
"""The SQL query can be optimized by reordering operations to perform `GROUP BY` earlier. In the CTE `wss`, the `GROUP BY` is already applied before the main query's `JOIN` operations. However, the main query performs two separate subqueries (`y` and `x`) that join `wss`, `store`, and `date_dim`. These subqueries can be optimized by pre-aggregating data before joining, reducing the dataset size early in the execution process. This involves restructuring the query to prioritize grouping operations, minimizing the workload on subsequent operations like `JOIN`, thereby enhancing execution speed and efficiency."""

Query Rewrite 5:
"""The SQL query uses `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY`, which can be optimized by encouraging the database engine to stop the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained. This avoids full table sorts and reduces execution time. The query already uses `ORDER BY s_store_name1, s_store_id1, d_week_seq1` followed by `LIMIT 100`, which aligns with the optimization strategy of Rule 3. Ensuring that the columns used in `ORDER BY` are indexed can further enhance performance."""

Query Rewrite 6:
"""The SQL query performs multiple joins on the same tables (`wss`, `store`, `date_dim`) in the subqueries `y` and `x`. These can be combined into a single join operation by using `CASE` statements to conditionally select different attributes from the tables in one pass. This reduces redundant data processing and simplifies the query structure. By integrating `GROUP BY` with aggregate functions like `MAX` within `CASE` statements, the result set can be condensed to only the necessary data, avoiding needless retrieval and processing steps.

This transformation allows the query to potentially reduce the size of the datasets before performing the join, which can improve performance. Specifically, the conditions `s_store_id1=s_store_id2` and `d_week_seq1=d_week_seq2-52` were moved to the `ON` clause, and similar transformations were applied to the subqueries, aligning with Case 1 of the query rewrite rule."""\n\nQuery Rewrite 2:\n"""The SQL query changes can be explained as follows: The original query used `SUM` functions with `CASE` expressions to conditionally sum `ss_sales_price` based on the day of the week. The rewrite rule identified these `CASE` expressions and transformed them into `SUM` functions with a `FILTER` clause. This transformation simplifies the query by directly applying the condition within the `FILTER` clause, making the query more efficient and easier to read. For example, the transformation from `SUM(CASE WHEN (d_day_name=\'Sunday\') THEN ss_sales_price ELSE NULL END)` to `SUM(ss_sales_price) FILTER (WHERE d_day_name=\'Sunday\')` achieves the same result but in a more streamlined manner."""\n\nQuery Rewrite 3:\n"""The SQL query changes can be explained as follows:\n- The original condition `ss_sales_price / ss_list_price BETWEEN 54 * 0.01 AND 74 * 0.01` was simplified by evaluating the constant expressions `54 * 0.01` and `74 * 0.01` to `0.54` and `0.74`, respectively. This simplification reduces computational overhead and improves query performance.\n- The `OR` condition for `s_state` was transformed into a `SEARCH` condition, which is a more efficient way to handle multiple equality checks. This transformation reduces redundancy and unnecessary complexity in the query, aligning with the goal of Case 3 to simplify conditions based on logical rules and known constraints."""\n\nQuery Rewrite 4:\n"""The SQL query can be optimized by reordering operations to perform `GROUP BY` earlier. In the CTE `wss`, the `GROUP BY` is already applied before the main query\'s `JOIN` operations. However, the main query performs two separate subqueries (`y` and `x`) that join `wss`, `store`, and `date_dim`. These subqueries can be optimized by pre-aggregating data before joining, reducing the dataset size early in the execution process. This involves restructuring the query to prioritize grouping operations, minimizing the workload on subsequent operations like `JOIN`, thereby enhancing execution speed and efficiency."""\n\nQuery Rewrite 5:\n"""The SQL query uses `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY`, which can be optimized by encouraging the database engine to stop the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained. This avoids full table sorts and reduces execution time. The query already uses `ORDER BY s_store_name1, s_store_id1, d_week_seq1` followed by `LIMIT 100`, which aligns with the optimization strategy of Rule 3. Ensuring that the columns used in `ORDER BY` are indexed can further enhance performance."""\n\nQuery Rewrite 6:\n"""The SQL query performs multiple joins on the same tables (`wss`, `store`, `date_dim`) in the subqueries `y` and `x`. These can be combined into a single join operation by using `CASE` statements to conditionally select different attributes from the tables in one pass. This reduces redundant data processing and simplifies the query structure. By integrating `GROUP BY` with aggregate functions like `MAX` within `CASE` statements, the result set can be condensed to only the necessary data, avoiding needless retrieval and processing steps. This transformation leads to a more efficient query, improving performance and simplifying maintenance."""'}], 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'stream': False, 'temperature': 0.1}}

The filter's expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there's a matching row in the non-preserving side's table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned."}, {'name': 'AGGREGATE_CASE_TO_FILTER', 'rewrite': '**Conditions**: 1.

First, constant expressions within conditions, such as `ss_sales_price / ss_list_price BETWEEN 54 * 0.01 AND 74 * 0.01`, can be pre-evaluated to `0.54` and `0.74`, reducing computational overhead. Additionally, the `OR` condition for `s_state` can be replaced with a `SEARCH` condition, which is more efficient for handling multiple equality checks, thereby reducing redundancy and complexity. Furthermore, the query\'s multiple joins on the same tables in subqueries can be consolidated into a single join operation using `CASE` statements to conditionally select attributes, which minimizes redundant data processing. By integrating `GROUP BY` with aggregate functions like `MAX` within these `CASE` statements, the query can be further condensed to retrieve only necessary data, enhancing efficiency and simplifying maintenance. These strategies collectively aim to streamline the query, improving its performance and maintainability."""\n\n### Suggestion 2:\n"""The provided SQL query can be optimized using two main strategies. The first strategy involves moving filter conditions that pertain to columns from only one side of a join into the `ON` clause of the `INNER JOIN`. This adjustment, specifically applied to conditions like `s_store_id1=s_store_id2` and `d_week_seq1=d_week_seq2-52`, can reduce the dataset size before the join operation, potentially improving performance. The second strategy focuses on reordering operations to perform `GROUP BY` earlier in the query execution. Although the `GROUP BY` is already applied in the CTE `wss`, the main query\'s subqueries (`y` and `x`) can be further optimized by pre-aggregating data before joining. This restructuring prioritizes grouping operations, which reduces the dataset size early on and minimizes the workload on subsequent operations like `JOIN`, thereby enhancing execution speed and efficiency."""\n\n### Suggestion 3:\n"""The provided SQL query can be optimized using two main strategies. The first strategy involves transforming `SUM` functions with `CASE` expressions into `SUM` functions with a `FILTER` clause. This change simplifies the query by directly applying the condition within the `FILTER` clause, making it more efficient and easier to read. For instance, the transformation from `SUM(CASE WHEN (d_day_name=\'Sunday\') THEN ss_sales_price ELSE NULL END)` to `SUM(ss_sales_price) FILTER (WHERE d_day_name=\'Sunday\')` achieves the same result in a more streamlined manner. The second strategy focuses on optimizing the use of `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY`. By encouraging the database engine to stop the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained, this approach avoids full table sorts and reduces execution time. The query already employs `ORDER BY s_store_name1, s_store_id1, d_week_seq1` followed by `LIMIT 100`, which aligns with this optimization strategy. Additionally, ensuring that the columns used in `ORDER BY` are indexed can further enhance performance."""\n\nQuery Rewrite Rules:\n### Rule FILTER_INTO_JOIN:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: This SQL query rewrite rule applies when a filter condition is placed on the result set of an INNER JOIN operation. The filter\'s expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there\'s a matching row in the non-preserving side\'s table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned."""\n\n### Rule AGGREGATE_CASE_TO_FILTER:\n"""**Conditions**: 1. The SQL query must contain an aggregate function (`SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT`, etc.) that operates on a CASE expression with a format resembling `CASE WHEN <condition> THEN <expression> END`.\n2. This CASE expression must be the sole argument to the aggregate function.\n3. The aggregate function must not be part of a more complex expression within the `SELECT` clause (i.e., it can be directly transformed).\n**Transformations**: - Identify the CASE expression within the aggregate function in the `SELECT` clause. Confirm it has the required structure (`CASE WHEN <condition> THEN <expression> END`).\n- Rewrite the aggregate function to remove the CASE expression and incorporate the filtering directly. Use the SQL `FILTER` clause to specify the same condition found in the original CASE expression.\n- Adjust the `SELECT` clause to include the updated aggregate function, now with the `FILTER (WHERE <condition>)` clause."""\n\n### Rule FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains conditions that can be statically determined as always true (e.g., constant expressions like `1=1` or tautologies based on the column data types and constraints), then these conditions don\'t affect the result set.\n**Transformations**: Remove such conditions from the WHERE clause. If this results in an empty WHERE clause, remove the WHERE clause entirely.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause simplifies to conditions that are always false or involve comparisons with NULL in a way that the outcome is always false or NULL (e.g., `column != column` or `1=0`), indicating no rows can satisfy the filter.\n**Transformations**: Replace the query with one that selects no rows. This could be represented in different ways based on the SQL dialect. One universal method might be selecting from a dual table with a false condition.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains complex conditions that can be simplified based on known constraints, constants, or through logical simplification (e.g., `column IS NOT NULL AND column IS NOT NULL` simplifies to `column IS NOT NULL`).\n**Transformations**: Simplify the conditions according to logical rules and known constraints. Remove redundancy and unnecessary complexity."""\n\n### Rule SORT_PROJECT_TRANSPOSE:\n"""**Conditions**: If a SQL query executes a sort operation on columns that are directly referenced in the SELECT list or through expressions that are strictly monotonic transformations of these columns, and the sort operation directly follows these projections (SELECT statements), the sort operation can be pushed to operate directly on the table (FROM clause) before the projection.\n**Transformations**: 1. Check Compatibility: Ensure both sort and project (SELECT and ORDER BY clauses) involve compatible operations that relate directly to the raw column data or involve monotonic transformations.\n2. Analyze Order By Fields: Verify that each column in the ORDER BY clause is directly represented in the SELECT list or is a derived column through a monotonic transformation (e.g., casting integers to floats where the order is preserved).\n3. Adjust SQL Query: Rewrite the query so that sorting (ORDER BY clause) is applied to the raw table data in the FROM clause rather than after the projection. This might involve introducing a subquery or CTE (Common Table Expression) where the sorting is applied first, followed by the projections.\n4. Optimize Projection: Ensure that the SELECT list in the outer query matches the original projection, applying on top of the sorted data now."""\n\n### Rule JOIN_PROJECT_BOTH_TRANSPOSE_INCLUDE_OUTER:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: When an SQL query performs an INNER JOIN between two tables or subqueries, and both sides of the join have a SELECT clause that projects certain columns directly before the join.\n**Transformations**: 1. Identify the columns projected on both sides of the INNER JOIN.\n2. Adjust the INNER JOIN\'s ON condition to match the column aliases provided in the projections, if necessary.\n3. Move the projection (SELECT clause) above the JOIN, combining both side\'s columns into a single SELECT clause immediately preceding the INNER JOIN.\n4. Ensure that the final SELECT projection after rearrangement matches the original output column list and order.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: When an SQL query performs a LEFT, RIGHT, or FULL OUTER JOIN between two subqueries or tables and both sides have a SELECT clause projecting specific columns. Additionally, the projection should not introduce NULL values in the result set which are not a result of the outer join mechanism.\n**Transformations**: 1. Examine both sides of the OUTER JOIN to confirm that the projections do not introduce unintended NULLs for outer rows.\n2. Adjust the OUTER JOIN\'s ON condition to use the column aliases from the projections, if needed.\n3. Move the SELECT projection to above the JOIN, ensuring columns from both sides are included in a single SELECT clause placed immediately before the OUTER JOIN.\n4.

First, constant expressions within conditions, such as `ss_sales_price / ss_list_price BETWEEN 54 * 0.01 AND 74 * 0.01`, can be pre-evaluated to `0.54` and `0.74`, reducing computational overhead. Additionally, the `OR` condition for `s_state` can be replaced with a `SEARCH` condition, which is more efficient for handling multiple equality checks, thereby reducing redundancy and complexity. Furthermore, the query\'s multiple joins on the same tables in subqueries can be consolidated into a single join operation using `CASE` statements to conditionally select attributes, which minimizes redundant data processing. By integrating `GROUP BY` with aggregate functions like `MAX` within these `CASE` statements, the query can be further condensed to retrieve only necessary data, enhancing efficiency and simplifying maintenance. These strategies collectively aim to streamline the query, improving its performance and maintainability."""\n\n### Suggestion 2:\n"""The provided SQL query can be optimized using two main strategies. The first strategy involves moving filter conditions that pertain to columns from only one side of a join into the `ON` clause of the `INNER JOIN`. This adjustment, specifically applied to conditions like `s_store_id1=s_store_id2` and `d_week_seq1=d_week_seq2-52`, can reduce the dataset size before the join operation, potentially improving performance. The second strategy focuses on reordering operations to perform `GROUP BY` earlier in the query execution. Although the `GROUP BY` is already applied in the CTE `wss`, the main query\'s subqueries (`y` and `x`) can be further optimized by pre-aggregating data before joining. This restructuring prioritizes grouping operations, which reduces the dataset size early on and minimizes the workload on subsequent operations like `JOIN`, thereby enhancing execution speed and efficiency."""\n\n### Suggestion 3:\n"""The provided SQL query can be optimized using two main strategies. The first strategy involves transforming `SUM` functions with `CASE` expressions into `SUM` functions with a `FILTER` clause. This change simplifies the query by directly applying the condition within the `FILTER` clause, making it more efficient and easier to read. For instance, the transformation from `SUM(CASE WHEN (d_day_name=\'Sunday\') THEN ss_sales_price ELSE NULL END)` to `SUM(ss_sales_price) FILTER (WHERE d_day_name=\'Sunday\')` achieves the same result in a more streamlined manner. The second strategy focuses on optimizing the use of `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY`. By encouraging the database engine to stop the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained, this approach avoids full table sorts and reduces execution time. The query already employs `ORDER BY s_store_name1, s_store_id1, d_week_seq1` followed by `LIMIT 100`, which aligns with this optimization strategy. Additionally, ensuring that the columns used in `ORDER BY` are indexed can further enhance performance."""\n\nQuery Rewrite Rules:\n### Rule FILTER_INTO_JOIN:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: This SQL query rewrite rule applies when a filter condition is placed on the result set of an INNER JOIN operation. The filter\'s expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there\'s a matching row in the non-preserving side\'s table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned."""\n\n### Rule AGGREGATE_CASE_TO_FILTER:\n"""**Conditions**: 1. The SQL query must contain an aggregate function (`SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT`, etc.) that operates on a CASE expression with a format resembling `CASE WHEN <condition> THEN <expression> END`.\n2. This CASE expression must be the sole argument to the aggregate function.\n3. The aggregate function must not be part of a more complex expression within the `SELECT` clause (i.e., it can be directly transformed).\n**Transformations**: - Identify the CASE expression within the aggregate function in the `SELECT` clause. Confirm it has the required structure (`CASE WHEN <condition> THEN <expression> END`).\n- Rewrite the aggregate function to remove the CASE expression and incorporate the filtering directly. Use the SQL `FILTER` clause to specify the same condition found in the original CASE expression.\n- Adjust the `SELECT` clause to include the updated aggregate function, now with the `FILTER (WHERE <condition>)` clause."""\n\n### Rule FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains conditions that can be statically determined as always true (e.g., constant expressions like `1=1` or tautologies based on the column data types and constraints), then these conditions don\'t affect the result set.\n**Transformations**: Remove such conditions from the WHERE clause. If this results in an empty WHERE clause, remove the WHERE clause entirely.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause simplifies to conditions that are always false or involve comparisons with NULL in a way that the outcome is always false or NULL (e.g., `column != column` or `1=0`), indicating no rows can satisfy the filter.\n**Transformations**: Replace the query with one that selects no rows. This could be represented in different ways based on the SQL dialect. One universal method might be selecting from a dual table with a false condition.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains complex conditions that can be simplified based on known constraints, constants, or through logical simplification (e.g., `column IS NOT NULL AND column IS NOT NULL` simplifies to `column IS NOT NULL`).\n**Transformations**: Simplify the conditions according to logical rules and known constraints. Remove redundancy and unnecessary complexity."""\n\n### Rule SORT_PROJECT_TRANSPOSE:\n"""**Conditions**: If a SQL query executes a sort operation on columns that are directly referenced in the SELECT list or through expressions that are strictly monotonic transformations of these columns, and the sort operation directly follows these projections (SELECT statements), the sort operation can be pushed to operate directly on the table (FROM clause) before the projection.\n**Transformations**: 1. Check Compatibility: Ensure both sort and project (SELECT and ORDER BY clauses) involve compatible operations that relate directly to the raw column data or involve monotonic transformations.\n2. Analyze Order By Fields: Verify that each column in the ORDER BY clause is directly represented in the SELECT list or is a derived column through a monotonic transformation (e.g., casting integers to floats where the order is preserved).\n3. Adjust SQL Query: Rewrite the query so that sorting (ORDER BY clause) is applied to the raw table data in the FROM clause rather than after the projection. This might involve introducing a subquery or CTE (Common Table Expression) where the sorting is applied first, followed by the projections.\n4. Optimize Projection: Ensure that the SELECT list in the outer query matches the original projection, applying on top of the sorted data now."""\n\n### Rule JOIN_PROJECT_BOTH_TRANSPOSE_INCLUDE_OUTER:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: When an SQL query performs an INNER JOIN between two tables or subqueries, and both sides of the join have a SELECT clause that projects certain columns directly before the join.\n**Transformations**: 1. Identify the columns projected on both sides of the INNER JOIN.\n2. Adjust the INNER JOIN\'s ON condition to match the column aliases provided in the projections, if necessary.\n3. Move the projection (SELECT clause) above the JOIN, combining both side\'s columns into a single SELECT clause immediately preceding the INNER JOIN.\n4. Ensure that the final SELECT projection after rearrangement matches the original output column list and order.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: When an SQL query performs a LEFT, RIGHT, or FULL OUTER JOIN between two subqueries or tables and both sides have a SELECT clause projecting specific columns. Additionally, the projection should not introduce NULL values in the result set which are not a result of the outer join mechanism.\n**Transformations**: 1. Examine both sides of the OUTER JOIN to confirm that the projections do not introduce unintended NULLs for outer rows.\n2. Adjust the OUTER JOIN\'s ON condition to use the column aliases from the projections, if needed.\n3. Move the SELECT projection to above the JOIN, ensuring columns from both sides are included in a single SELECT clause placed immediately before the OUTER JOIN.\n4. If the join was an OUTER JOIN, additional care must be taken to ensure null compatibility and semantics are preserved, potentially adjusting the SELECT list to include explicit casting or CASE expressions to maintain nullability."""\n\n### Rule PROJECT_FILTER_TRANSPOSE:\n"""**Conditions**: This rewrite rule can be applied when an SQL query contains a SELECT operation (acting as the `Project` operation) followed by a WHERE clause (acting as the `Filter` operation), provided that the SELECT does not contain window functions (such as RANK(), ROW_NUMBER(), etc.) and the columns selected do not affect the outcome of the WHERE clause.\n**Transformations**: To apply the rule, refactor the SQL query so that the conditions in the WHERE clause are evaluated before the columns are selected in the SELECT clause. This may involve moving computations or column transformations from the SELECT clause to a sub-query that the WHERE clause is applied on, ensuring the final SELECT clause on the outermost query matches the original query\'s expected outcome. - Before: SELECT col1, transformation_function(col2) FROM table WHERE condition; - After: SELECT col1, transformation_function(col2) FROM (SELECT col1, col2 FROM table WHERE condition) AS subquery;"""\n\n### Rule JOIN_PROJECT_RIGHT_TRANSPOSE_INCLUDE_OUTER:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: 1.

First, constant expressions within conditions, such as `ss_sales_price / ss_list_price BETWEEN 54 * 0.01 AND 74 * 0.01`, can be pre-evaluated to `0.54` and `0.74`, reducing computational overhead. Additionally, the `OR` condition for `s_state` can be replaced with a `SEARCH` condition, which is more efficient for handling multiple equality checks, thereby reducing redundancy and complexity. Furthermore, the query\'s multiple joins on the same tables in subqueries can be consolidated into a single join operation using `CASE` statements to conditionally select attributes, which minimizes redundant data processing. By integrating `GROUP BY` with aggregate functions like `MAX` within these `CASE` statements, the query can be further condensed to retrieve only necessary data, enhancing efficiency and simplifying maintenance. These strategies collectively aim to streamline the query, improving its performance and maintainability."""\n\n### Suggestion 2:\n"""The provided SQL query can be optimized using two main strategies. The first strategy involves moving filter conditions that pertain to columns from only one side of a join into the `ON` clause of the `INNER JOIN`. This adjustment, specifically applied to conditions like `s_store_id1=s_store_id2` and `d_week_seq1=d_week_seq2-52`, can reduce the dataset size before the join operation, potentially improving performance. The second strategy focuses on reordering operations to perform `GROUP BY` earlier in the query execution. Although the `GROUP BY` is already applied in the CTE `wss`, the main query\'s subqueries (`y` and `x`) can be further optimized by pre-aggregating data before joining. This restructuring prioritizes grouping operations, which reduces the dataset size early on and minimizes the workload on subsequent operations like `JOIN`, thereby enhancing execution speed and efficiency."""\n\n### Suggestion 3:\n"""The provided SQL query can be optimized using two main strategies. The first strategy involves transforming `SUM` functions with `CASE` expressions into `SUM` functions with a `FILTER` clause. This change simplifies the query by directly applying the condition within the `FILTER` clause, making it more efficient and easier to read. For instance, the transformation from `SUM(CASE WHEN (d_day_name=\'Sunday\') THEN ss_sales_price ELSE NULL END)` to `SUM(ss_sales_price) FILTER (WHERE d_day_name=\'Sunday\')` achieves the same result in a more streamlined manner. The second strategy focuses on optimizing the use of `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY`. By encouraging the database engine to stop the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained, this approach avoids full table sorts and reduces execution time. The query already employs `ORDER BY s_store_name1, s_store_id1, d_week_seq1` followed by `LIMIT 100`, which aligns with this optimization strategy. Additionally, ensuring that the columns used in `ORDER BY` are indexed can further enhance performance."""\n\nQuery Rewrite Rule Sets:\n### AGGREGATE Operator Rules: ["AGGREGATE_CASE_TO_FILTER"]\n\n### FILTER Operator Rules: ["FILTER_INTO_JOIN", "AGGREGATE_CASE_TO_FILTER", "FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS", "PROJECT_FILTER_TRANSPOSE"]\n\n### JOIN Operator Rules: ["FILTER_INTO_JOIN", "JOIN_PROJECT_BOTH_TRANSPOSE_INCLUDE_OUTER"]\n\n### PROJECT Operator Rules: ["JOIN_PROJECT_BOTH_TRANSPOSE_INCLUDE_OUTER", "PROJECT_FILTER_TRANSPOSE"]\n\nQuery Rewrite Rule Explanations:\n### Rule FILTER_INTO_JOIN:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: This SQL query rewrite rule applies when a filter condition is placed on the result set of an INNER JOIN operation. The filter\'s expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there\'s a matching row in the non-preserving side\'s table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned."""\n\n### Rule AGGREGATE_CASE_TO_FILTER:\n"""**Conditions**: 1. The SQL query must contain an aggregate function (`SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT`, etc.) that operates on a CASE expression with a format resembling `CASE WHEN <condition> THEN <expression> END`.\n2. This CASE expression must be the sole argument to the aggregate function.\n3. The aggregate function must not be part of a more complex expression within the `SELECT` clause (i.e., it can be directly transformed).\n**Transformations**: - Identify the CASE expression within the aggregate function in the `SELECT` clause. Confirm it has the required structure (`CASE WHEN <condition> THEN <expression> END`).\n- Rewrite the aggregate function to remove the CASE expression and incorporate the filtering directly. Use the SQL `FILTER` clause to specify the same condition found in the original CASE expression.\n- Adjust the `SELECT` clause to include the updated aggregate function, now with the `FILTER (WHERE <condition>)` clause."""\n\n### Rule FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains conditions that can be statically determined as always true (e.g., constant expressions like `1=1` or tautologies based on the column data types and constraints), then these conditions don\'t affect the result set.\n**Transformations**: Remove such conditions from the WHERE clause. If this results in an empty WHERE clause, remove the WHERE clause entirely.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause simplifies to conditions that are always false or involve comparisons with NULL in a way that the outcome is always false or NULL (e.g., `column != column` or `1=0`), indicating no rows can satisfy the filter.\n**Transformations**: Replace the query with one that selects no rows. This could be represented in different ways based on the SQL dialect. One universal method might be selecting from a dual table with a false condition.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains complex conditions that can be simplified based on known constraints, constants, or through logical simplification (e.g., `column IS NOT NULL AND column IS NOT NULL` simplifies to `column IS NOT NULL`).\n**Transformations**: Simplify the conditions according to logical rules and known constraints. Remove redundancy and unnecessary complexity."""\n\n### Rule JOIN_PROJECT_BOTH_TRANSPOSE_INCLUDE_OUTER:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: When an SQL query performs an INNER JOIN between two tables or subqueries, and both sides of the join have a SELECT clause that projects certain columns directly before the join.\n**Transformations**: 1. Identify the columns projected on both sides of the INNER JOIN.\n2. Adjust the INNER JOIN\'s ON condition to match the column aliases provided in the projections, if necessary.\n3. Move the projection (SELECT clause) above the JOIN, combining both side\'s columns into a single SELECT clause immediately preceding the INNER JOIN.\n4. Ensure that the final SELECT projection after rearrangement matches the original output column list and order.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: When an SQL query performs a LEFT, RIGHT, or FULL OUTER JOIN between two subqueries or tables and both sides have a SELECT clause projecting specific columns. Additionally, the projection should not introduce NULL values in the result set which are not a result of the outer join mechanism.\n**Transformations**: 1. Examine both sides of the OUTER JOIN to confirm that the projections do not introduce unintended NULLs for outer rows.\n2. Adjust the OUTER JOIN\'s ON condition to use the column aliases from the projections, if needed.\n3. Move the SELECT projection to above the JOIN, ensuring columns from both sides are included in a single SELECT clause placed immediately before the OUTER JOIN.\n4. If the join was an OUTER JOIN, additional care must be taken to ensure null compatibility and semantics are preserved, potentially adjusting the SELECT list to include explicit casting or CASE expressions to maintain nullability."""\n\n### Rule PROJECT_FILTER_TRANSPOSE:\n"""**Conditions**: This rewrite rule can be applied when an SQL query contains a SELECT operation (acting as the `Project` operation) followed by a WHERE clause (acting as the `Filter` operation), provided that the SELECT does not contain window functions (such as RANK(), ROW_NUMBER(), etc.) and the columns selected do not affect the outcome of the WHERE clause.\n**Transformations**: To apply the rule, refactor the SQL query so that the conditions in the WHERE clause are evaluated before the columns are selected in the SELECT clause. This may involve moving computations or column transformations from the SELECT clause to a sub-query that the WHERE clause is applied on, ensuring the final SELECT clause on the outermost query matches the original query\'s expected outcome. - Before: SELECT col1, transformation_function(col2) FROM table WHERE condition; - After: SELECT col1, transformation_function(col2) FROM (SELECT col1, col2 FROM table WHERE condition) AS subquery;"""'}], 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'stream': False, 'temperature': 0.1}}

For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there\'s a matching row in the non-preserving side\'s table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned."""\n\n### Rule AGGREGATE_CASE_TO_FILTER:\n"""**Conditions**: 1. The SQL query must contain an aggregate function (`SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT`, etc.) that operates on a CASE expression with a format resembling `CASE WHEN <condition> THEN <expression> END`.\n2. This CASE expression must be the sole argument to the aggregate function.\n3. The aggregate function must not be part of a more complex expression within the `SELECT` clause (i.e., it can be directly transformed).\n**Transformations**: - Identify the CASE expression within the aggregate function in the `SELECT` clause. Confirm it has the required structure (`CASE WHEN <condition> THEN <expression> END`).\n- Rewrite the aggregate function to remove the CASE expression and incorporate the filtering directly. Use the SQL `FILTER` clause to specify the same condition found in the original CASE expression.\n- Adjust the `SELECT` clause to include the updated aggregate function, now with the `FILTER (WHERE <condition>)` clause."""\n\n### Rule FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains conditions that can be statically determined as always true (e.g., constant expressions like `1=1` or tautologies based on the column data types and constraints), then these conditions don\'t affect the result set.\n**Transformations**: Remove such conditions from the WHERE clause. If this results in an empty WHERE clause, remove the WHERE clause entirely.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause simplifies to conditions that are always false or involve comparisons with NULL in a way that the outcome is always false or NULL (e.g., `column != column` or `1=0`), indicating no rows can satisfy the filter.\n**Transformations**: Replace the query with one that selects no rows. This could be represented in different ways based on the SQL dialect. One universal method might be selecting from a dual table with a false condition.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains complex conditions that can be simplified based on known constraints, constants, or through logical simplification (e.g., `column IS NOT NULL AND column IS NOT NULL` simplifies to `column IS NOT NULL`).\n**Transformations**: Simplify the conditions according to logical rules and known constraints. Remove redundancy and unnecessary complexity."""\n\n### Rule JOIN_PROJECT_BOTH_TRANSPOSE_INCLUDE_OUTER:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: When an SQL query performs an INNER JOIN between two tables or subqueries, and both sides of the join have a SELECT clause that projects certain columns directly before the join.\n**Transformations**: 1. Identify the columns projected on both sides of the INNER JOIN.\n2. Adjust the INNER JOIN\'s ON condition to match the column aliases provided in the projections, if necessary.\n3. Move the projection (SELECT clause) above the JOIN, combining both side\'s columns into a single SELECT clause immediately preceding the INNER JOIN.\n4. Ensure that the final SELECT projection after rearrangement matches the original output column list and order.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: When an SQL query performs a LEFT, RIGHT, or FULL OUTER JOIN between two subqueries or tables and both sides have a SELECT clause projecting specific columns. Additionally, the projection should not introduce NULL values in the result set which are not a result of the outer join mechanism.\n**Transformations**: 1. Examine both sides of the OUTER JOIN to confirm that the projections do not introduce unintended NULLs for outer rows.\n2. Adjust the OUTER JOIN\'s ON condition to use the column aliases from the projections, if needed.\n3. Move the SELECT projection to above the JOIN, ensuring columns from both sides are included in a single SELECT clause placed immediately before the OUTER JOIN.\n4.

First, constant expressions within conditions, such as `ss_sales_price / ss_list_price BETWEEN 54 * 0.01 AND 74 * 0.01`, can be pre-evaluated to `0.54` and `0.74`, reducing computational overhead. Additionally, the `OR` condition for `s_state` can be replaced with a `SEARCH` condition, which is more efficient for handling multiple equality checks, thereby reducing redundancy and complexity. Furthermore, the query\'s multiple joins on the same tables in subqueries can be consolidated into a single join operation using `CASE` statements to conditionally select attributes, which minimizes redundant data processing. By integrating `GROUP BY` with aggregate functions like `MAX` within these `CASE` statements, the query can be further condensed to retrieve only necessary data, enhancing efficiency and simplifying maintenance. These strategies collectively aim to streamline the query, improving its performance and maintainability."""\n\n### Suggestion 2:\n"""The provided SQL query can be optimized using two main strategies. The first strategy involves moving filter conditions that pertain to columns from only one side of a join into the `ON` clause of the `INNER JOIN`. This adjustment, specifically applied to conditions like `s_store_id1=s_store_id2` and `d_week_seq1=d_week_seq2-52`, can reduce the dataset size before the join operation, potentially improving performance. The second strategy focuses on reordering operations to perform `GROUP BY` earlier in the query execution. Although the `GROUP BY` is already applied in the CTE `wss`, the main query\'s subqueries (`y` and `x`) can be further optimized by pre-aggregating data before joining. This restructuring prioritizes grouping operations, which reduces the dataset size early on and minimizes the workload on subsequent operations like `JOIN`, thereby enhancing execution speed and efficiency."""\n\n### Suggestion 3:\n"""The provided SQL query can be optimized using two main strategies. The first strategy involves transforming `SUM` functions with `CASE` expressions into `SUM` functions with a `FILTER` clause. This change simplifies the query by directly applying the condition within the `FILTER` clause, making it more efficient and easier to read. For instance, the transformation from `SUM(CASE WHEN (d_day_name=\'Sunday\') THEN ss_sales_price ELSE NULL END)` to `SUM(ss_sales_price) FILTER (WHERE d_day_name=\'Sunday\')` achieves the same result in a more streamlined manner. The second strategy focuses on optimizing the use of `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY`. By encouraging the database engine to stop the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained, this approach avoids full table sorts and reduces execution time. The query already employs `ORDER BY s_store_name1, s_store_id1, d_week_seq1` followed by `LIMIT 100`, which aligns with this optimization strategy. Additionally, ensuring that the columns used in `ORDER BY` are indexed can further enhance performance."""\n\nQuery Rewrite Rules:\n### Rule FILTER_INTO_JOIN:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: This SQL query rewrite rule applies when a filter condition is placed on the result set of an INNER JOIN operation. The filter\'s expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join.

First, constant expressions within conditions, such as `ss_sales_price / ss_list_price BETWEEN 54 * 0.01 AND 74 * 0.01`, can be pre-evaluated to `0.54` and `0.74`, reducing computational overhead. Additionally, the `OR` condition for `s_state` can be replaced with a `SEARCH` condition, which is more efficient for handling multiple equality checks, thereby reducing redundancy and complexity. Furthermore, the query\'s multiple joins on the same tables in subqueries can be consolidated into a single join operation using `CASE` statements to conditionally select attributes, which minimizes redundant data processing. By integrating `GROUP BY` with aggregate functions like `MAX` within these `CASE` statements, the query can be further condensed to retrieve only necessary data, enhancing efficiency and simplifying maintenance. These strategies collectively aim to streamline the query, improving its performance and maintainability."""\n\n### Suggestion 2:\n"""The provided SQL query can be optimized using two main strategies. The first strategy involves moving filter conditions that pertain to columns from only one side of a join into the `ON` clause of the `INNER JOIN`. This adjustment, specifically applied to conditions like `s_store_id1=s_store_id2` and `d_week_seq1=d_week_seq2-52`, can reduce the dataset size before the join operation, potentially improving performance. The second strategy focuses on reordering operations to perform `GROUP BY` earlier in the query execution. Although the `GROUP BY` is already applied in the CTE `wss`, the main query\'s subqueries (`y` and `x`) can be further optimized by pre-aggregating data before joining. This restructuring prioritizes grouping operations, which reduces the dataset size early on and minimizes the workload on subsequent operations like `JOIN`, thereby enhancing execution speed and efficiency."""\n\n### Suggestion 3:\n"""The provided SQL query can be optimized using two main strategies. The first strategy involves transforming `SUM` functions with `CASE` expressions into `SUM` functions with a `FILTER` clause. This change simplifies the query by directly applying the condition within the `FILTER` clause, making it more efficient and easier to read. For instance, the transformation from `SUM(CASE WHEN (d_day_name=\'Sunday\') THEN ss_sales_price ELSE NULL END)` to `SUM(ss_sales_price) FILTER (WHERE d_day_name=\'Sunday\')` achieves the same result in a more streamlined manner. The second strategy focuses on optimizing the use of `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY`. By encouraging the database engine to stop the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained, this approach avoids full table sorts and reduces execution time. The query already employs `ORDER BY s_store_name1, s_store_id1, d_week_seq1` followed by `LIMIT 100`, which aligns with this optimization strategy. Additionally, ensuring that the columns used in `ORDER BY` are indexed can further enhance performance."""\n\nQuery Rewrite Rules:\n### Rule FILTER_INTO_JOIN:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: This SQL query rewrite rule applies when a filter condition is placed on the result set of an INNER JOIN operation. The filter\'s expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there\'s a matching row in the non-preserving side\'s table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned."""\n\n### Rule AGGREGATE_CASE_TO_FILTER:\n"""**Conditions**: 1. The SQL query must contain an aggregate function (`SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT`, etc.) that operates on a CASE expression with a format resembling `CASE WHEN <condition> THEN <expression> END`.\n2. This CASE expression must be the sole argument to the aggregate function.\n3. The aggregate function must not be part of a more complex expression within the `SELECT` clause (i.e., it can be directly transformed).\n**Transformations**: - Identify the CASE expression within the aggregate function in the `SELECT` clause. Confirm it has the required structure (`CASE WHEN <condition> THEN <expression> END`).\n- Rewrite the aggregate function to remove the CASE expression and incorporate the filtering directly. Use the SQL `FILTER` clause to specify the same condition found in the original CASE expression.\n- Adjust the `SELECT` clause to include the updated aggregate function, now with the `FILTER (WHERE <condition>)` clause."""\n\n### Rule FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains conditions that can be statically determined as always true (e.g., constant expressions like `1=1` or tautologies based on the column data types and constraints), then these conditions don\'t affect the result set.\n**Transformations**: Remove such conditions from the WHERE clause. If this results in an empty WHERE clause, remove the WHERE clause entirely.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause simplifies to conditions that are always false or involve comparisons with NULL in a way that the outcome is always false or NULL (e.g., `column != column` or `1=0`), indicating no rows can satisfy the filter.\n**Transformations**: Replace the query with one that selects no rows. This could be represented in different ways based on the SQL dialect. One universal method might be selecting from a dual table with a false condition.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains complex conditions that can be simplified based on known constraints, constants, or through logical simplification (e.g., `column IS NOT NULL AND column IS NOT NULL` simplifies to `column IS NOT NULL`).\n**Transformations**: Simplify the conditions according to logical rules and known constraints. Remove redundancy and unnecessary complexity."""\n\n### Rule JOIN_PROJECT_BOTH_TRANSPOSE_INCLUDE_OUTER:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: When an SQL query performs an INNER JOIN between two tables or subqueries, and both sides of the join have a SELECT clause that projects certain columns directly before the join.\n**Transformations**: 1. Identify the columns projected on both sides of the INNER JOIN.\n2. Adjust the INNER JOIN\'s ON condition to match the column aliases provided in the projections, if necessary.\n3. Move the projection (SELECT clause) above the JOIN, combining both side\'s columns into a single SELECT clause immediately preceding the INNER JOIN.\n4. Ensure that the final SELECT projection after rearrangement matches the original output column list and order.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: When an SQL query performs a LEFT, RIGHT, or FULL OUTER JOIN between two subqueries or tables and both sides have a SELECT clause projecting specific columns. Additionally, the projection should not introduce NULL values in the result set which are not a result of the outer join mechanism.\n**Transformations**: 1. Examine both sides of the OUTER JOIN to confirm that the projections do not introduce unintended NULLs for outer rows.\n2. Adjust the OUTER JOIN\'s ON condition to use the column aliases from the projections, if needed.\n3. Move the SELECT projection to above the JOIN, ensuring columns from both sides are included in a single SELECT clause placed immediately before the OUTER JOIN.\n4. If the join was an OUTER JOIN, additional care must be taken to ensure null compatibility and semantics are preserved, potentially adjusting the SELECT list to include explicit casting or CASE expressions to maintain nullability."""\n\n### Rule PROJECT_FILTER_TRANSPOSE:\n"""**Conditions**: This rewrite rule can be applied when an SQL query contains a SELECT operation (acting as the `Project` operation) followed by a WHERE clause (acting as the `Filter` operation), provided that the SELECT does not contain window functions (such as RANK(), ROW_NUMBER(), etc.) and the columns selected do not affect the outcome of the WHERE clause.\n**Transformations**: To apply the rule, refactor the SQL query so that the conditions in the WHERE clause are evaluated before the columns are selected in the SELECT clause. This may involve moving computations or column transformations from the SELECT clause to a sub-query that the WHERE clause is applied on, ensuring the final SELECT clause on the outermost query matches the original query\'s expected outcome. - Before: SELECT col1, transformation_function(col2) FROM table WHERE condition; - After: SELECT col1, transformation_function(col2) FROM (SELECT col1, col2 FROM table WHERE condition) AS subquery;"""\n\nRule Subset Sequences:\n### Rule Sequence 1: ["AGGREGATE_CASE_TO_FILTER"]\n\n### Rule Sequence 2: ["FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS", "AGGREGATE_CASE_TO_FILTER", "FILTER_INTO_JOIN"]\n\n### Rule Sequence 3: ["FILTER_INTO_JOIN"]\n\n### Rule Sequence 4: ["PROJECT_FILTER_TRANSPOSE"]'}], 'response': 'To optimize the given SQL query, we need to apply the provided query rewrite rules in a sequence that maximizes performance improvements.

First, constant expressions within conditions, such as `ss_sales_price / ss_list_price BETWEEN 54 * 0.01 AND 74 * 0.01`, can be pre-evaluated to `0.54` and `0.74`, reducing computational overhead. Additionally, the `OR` condition for `s_state` can be replaced with a `SEARCH` condition, which is more efficient for handling multiple equality checks, thereby reducing redundancy and complexity. Furthermore, the query\'s multiple joins on the same tables in subqueries can be consolidated into a single join operation using `CASE` statements to conditionally select attributes, which minimizes redundant data processing. By integrating `GROUP BY` with aggregate functions like `MAX` within these `CASE` statements, the query can be further condensed to retrieve only necessary data, enhancing efficiency and simplifying maintenance. These strategies collectively aim to streamline the query, improving its performance and maintainability."""\n\n### Suggestion 2:\n"""The provided SQL query can be optimized using two main strategies. The first strategy involves moving filter conditions that pertain to columns from only one side of a join into the `ON` clause of the `INNER JOIN`. This adjustment, specifically applied to conditions like `s_store_id1=s_store_id2` and `d_week_seq1=d_week_seq2-52`, can reduce the dataset size before the join operation, potentially improving performance. The second strategy focuses on reordering operations to perform `GROUP BY` earlier in the query execution. Although the `GROUP BY` is already applied in the CTE `wss`, the main query\'s subqueries (`y` and `x`) can be further optimized by pre-aggregating data before joining. This restructuring prioritizes grouping operations, which reduces the dataset size early on and minimizes the workload on subsequent operations like `JOIN`, thereby enhancing execution speed and efficiency."""\n\n### Suggestion 3:\n"""The provided SQL query can be optimized using two main strategies. The first strategy involves transforming `SUM` functions with `CASE` expressions into `SUM` functions with a `FILTER` clause. This change simplifies the query by directly applying the condition within the `FILTER` clause, making it more efficient and easier to read. For instance, the transformation from `SUM(CASE WHEN (d_day_name=\'Sunday\') THEN ss_sales_price ELSE NULL END)` to `SUM(ss_sales_price) FILTER (WHERE d_day_name=\'Sunday\')` achieves the same result in a more streamlined manner. The second strategy focuses on optimizing the use of `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY`. By encouraging the database engine to stop the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained, this approach avoids full table sorts and reduces execution time. The query already employs `ORDER BY s_store_name1, s_store_id1, d_week_seq1` followed by `LIMIT 100`, which aligns with this optimization strategy. Additionally, ensuring that the columns used in `ORDER BY` are indexed can further enhance performance."""\n\nQuery Rewrite Rules:\n### Rule FILTER_INTO_JOIN:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: This SQL query rewrite rule applies when a filter condition is placed on the result set of an INNER JOIN operation. The filter\'s expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there\'s a matching row in the non-preserving side\'s table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned."""\n\n### Rule AGGREGATE_CASE_TO_FILTER:\n"""**Conditions**: 1. The SQL query must contain an aggregate function (`SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT`, etc.) that operates on a CASE expression with a format resembling `CASE WHEN <condition> THEN <expression> END`.\n2. This CASE expression must be the sole argument to the aggregate function.\n3. The aggregate function must not be part of a more complex expression within the `SELECT` clause (i.e., it can be directly transformed).\n**Transformations**: - Identify the CASE expression within the aggregate function in the `SELECT` clause. Confirm it has the required structure (`CASE WHEN <condition> THEN <expression> END`).\n- Rewrite the aggregate function to remove the CASE expression and incorporate the filtering directly. Use the SQL `FILTER` clause to specify the same condition found in the original CASE expression.\n- Adjust the `SELECT` clause to include the updated aggregate function, now with the `FILTER (WHERE <condition>)` clause."""\n\n### Rule FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains conditions that can be statically determined as always true (e.g., constant expressions like `1=1` or tautologies based on the column data types and constraints), then these conditions don\'t affect the result set.\n**Transformations**: Remove such conditions from the WHERE clause. If this results in an empty WHERE clause, remove the WHERE clause entirely.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause simplifies to conditions that are always false or involve comparisons with NULL in a way that the outcome is always false or NULL (e.g., `column != column` or `1=0`), indicating no rows can satisfy the filter.\n**Transformations**: Replace the query with one that selects no rows. This could be represented in different ways based on the SQL dialect. One universal method might be selecting from a dual table with a false condition.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains complex conditions that can be simplified based on known constraints, constants, or through logical simplification (e.g., `column IS NOT NULL AND column IS NOT NULL` simplifies to `column IS NOT NULL`).\n**Transformations**: Simplify the conditions according to logical rules and known constraints. Remove redundancy and unnecessary complexity."""\n\n### Rule JOIN_PROJECT_BOTH_TRANSPOSE_INCLUDE_OUTER:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: When an SQL query performs an INNER JOIN between two tables or subqueries, and both sides of the join have a SELECT clause that projects certain columns directly before the join.\n**Transformations**: 1. Identify the columns projected on both sides of the INNER JOIN.\n2. Adjust the INNER JOIN\'s ON condition to match the column aliases provided in the projections, if necessary.\n3. Move the projection (SELECT clause) above the JOIN, combining both side\'s columns into a single SELECT clause immediately preceding the INNER JOIN.\n4. Ensure that the final SELECT projection after rearrangement matches the original output column list and order.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: When an SQL query performs a LEFT, RIGHT, or FULL OUTER JOIN between two subqueries or tables and both sides have a SELECT clause projecting specific columns. Additionally, the projection should not introduce NULL values in the result set which are not a result of the outer join mechanism.\n**Transformations**: 1. Examine both sides of the OUTER JOIN to confirm that the projections do not introduce unintended NULLs for outer rows.\n2. Adjust the OUTER JOIN\'s ON condition to use the column aliases from the projections, if needed.\n3. Move the SELECT projection to above the JOIN, ensuring columns from both sides are included in a single SELECT clause placed immediately before the OUTER JOIN.\n4. If the join was an OUTER JOIN, additional care must be taken to ensure null compatibility and semantics are preserved, potentially adjusting the SELECT list to include explicit casting or CASE expressions to maintain nullability."""\n\n### Rule PROJECT_FILTER_TRANSPOSE:\n"""**Conditions**: This rewrite rule can be applied when an SQL query contains a SELECT operation (acting as the `Project` operation) followed by a WHERE clause (acting as the `Filter` operation), provided that the SELECT does not contain window functions (such as RANK(), ROW_NUMBER(), etc.) and the columns selected do not affect the outcome of the WHERE clause.\n**Transformations**: To apply the rule, refactor the SQL query so that the conditions in the WHERE clause are evaluated before the columns are selected in the SELECT clause. This may involve moving computations or column transformations from the SELECT clause to a sub-query that the WHERE clause is applied on, ensuring the final SELECT clause on the outermost query matches the original query\'s expected outcome. - Before: SELECT col1, transformation_function(col2) FROM table WHERE condition; - After: SELECT col1, transformation_function(col2) FROM (SELECT col1, col2 FROM table WHERE condition) AS subquery;"""\n\nArranged Rule Sequence: ["FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS", "AGGREGATE_CASE_TO_FILTER", "FILTER_INTO_JOIN", "PROJECT_FILTER_TRANSPOSE"]\n\nUtilized Rules: ["FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS", "AGGREGATE_CASE_TO_FILTER", "FILTER_INTO_JOIN"]\n\nUnutilized Rules: ["PROJECT_FILTER_TRANSPOSE"]'}], 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'stream': False, 'temperature': 0.1}}

The SQL query must contain an aggregate function (`SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT`, etc.) that operates on a CASE expression with a format resembling `CASE WHEN <condition> THEN <expression> END`.\n2. This CASE expression must be the sole argument to the aggregate function.\n3. The aggregate function must not be part of a more complex expression within the `SELECT` clause (i.e., it can be directly transformed).\n**Transformations**: - Identify the CASE expression within the aggregate function in the `SELECT` clause. Confirm it has the required structure (`CASE WHEN <condition> THEN <expression> END`).\n- Rewrite the aggregate function to remove the CASE expression and incorporate the filtering directly. Use the SQL `FILTER` clause to specify the same condition found in the original CASE expression.\n- Adjust the `SELECT` clause to include the updated aggregate function, now with the `FILTER (WHERE <condition>)` clause."""\n\n### Rule FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains conditions that can be statically determined as always true (e.g., constant expressions like `1=1` or tautologies based on the column data types and constraints), then these conditions don\'t affect the result set.\n**Transformations**: Remove such conditions from the WHERE clause. If this results in an empty WHERE clause, remove the WHERE clause entirely.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause simplifies to conditions that are always false or involve comparisons with NULL in a way that the outcome is always false or NULL (e.g., `column != column` or `1=0`), indicating no rows can satisfy the filter.\n**Transformations**: Replace the query with one that selects no rows. This could be represented in different ways based on the SQL dialect. One universal method might be selecting from a dual table with a false condition.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains complex conditions that can be simplified based on known constraints, constants, or through logical simplification (e.g., `column IS NOT NULL AND column IS NOT NULL` simplifies to `column IS NOT NULL`).\n**Transformations**: Simplify the conditions according to logical rules and known constraints. Remove redundancy and unnecessary complexity."""\n\n### Rule JOIN_PROJECT_BOTH_TRANSPOSE_INCLUDE_OUTER:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: When an SQL query performs an INNER JOIN between two tables or subqueries, and both sides of the join have a SELECT clause that projects certain columns directly before the join.\n**Transformations**: 1. Identify the columns projected on both sides of the INNER JOIN.\n2. Adjust the INNER JOIN\'s ON condition to match the column aliases provided in the projections, if necessary.\n3. Move the projection (SELECT clause) above the JOIN, combining both side\'s columns into a single SELECT clause immediately preceding the INNER JOIN.\n4. Ensure that the final SELECT projection after rearrangement matches the original output column list and order.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: When an SQL query performs a LEFT, RIGHT, or FULL OUTER JOIN between two subqueries or tables and both sides have a SELECT clause projecting specific columns. Additionally, the projection should not introduce NULL values in the result set which are not a result of the outer join mechanism.\n**Transformations**: 1. Examine both sides of the OUTER JOIN to confirm that the projections do not introduce unintended NULLs for outer rows.\n2. Adjust the OUTER JOIN\'s ON condition to use the column aliases from the projections, if needed.\n3. Move the SELECT projection to above the JOIN, ensuring columns from both sides are included in a single SELECT clause placed immediately before the OUTER JOIN.\n4. If the join was an OUTER JOIN, additional care must be taken to ensure null compatibility and semantics are preserved, potentially adjusting the SELECT list to include explicit casting or CASE expressions to maintain nullability."""\n\n### Rule PROJECT_FILTER_TRANSPOSE:\n"""**Conditions**: This rewrite rule can be applied when an SQL query contains a SELECT operation (acting as the `Project` operation) followed by a WHERE clause (acting as the `Filter` operation), provided that the SELECT does not contain window functions (such as RANK(), ROW_NUMBER(), etc.) and the columns selected do not affect the outcome of the WHERE clause.\n**Transformations**: To apply the rule, refactor the SQL query so that the conditions in the WHERE clause are evaluated before the columns are selected in the SELECT clause. This may involve moving computations or column transformations from the SELECT clause to a sub-query that the WHERE clause is applied on, ensuring the final SELECT clause on the outermost query matches the original query\'s expected outcome. - Before: SELECT col1, transformation_function(col2) FROM table WHERE condition; - After: SELECT col1, transformation_function(col2) FROM (SELECT col1, col2 FROM table WHERE condition) AS subquery;"""\n\nArranged Rule Sequence: ["FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS", "AGGREGATE_CASE_TO_FILTER", "FILTER_INTO_JOIN", "PROJECT_FILTER_TRANSPOSE"]\n\nUtilized Rules: ["FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS", "AGGREGATE_CASE_TO_FILTER", "FILTER_INTO_JOIN"]\n\nUnutilized Rules: ["PROJECT_FILTER_TRANSPOSE"]'}], 'response': 'Step 1: The unutilized rule "PROJECT_FILTER_TRANSPOSE" does not directly match any of the provided query rewrite suggestions. The suggestions focus on pre-evaluating constant expressions, using `SEARCH` conditions, consolidating joins, and using `FILTER` clauses, none of which directly relate to transposing projections and filters. Therefore, this rule should not be prioritized over the utilized rules.\n\nStep 2: The utilized rules "FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS", "AGGREGATE_CASE_TO_FILTER", and "FILTER_INTO_JOIN" align well with the provided suggestions. "FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS" matches the suggestion to pre-evaluate constant expressions. "AGGREGATE_CASE_TO_FILTER" aligns with the suggestion to use `FILTER` clauses instead of `CASE` expressions. "FILTER_INTO_JOIN" corresponds to the suggestion to move filter conditions into the `ON` clause of joins. Since these utilized rules are already well-aligned with the suggestions, the sequence does not need significant changes. However, to ensure clarity and logical flow, the sequence can be slightly adjusted to reflect the natural order of operations: reducing expressions, transforming aggregates, and optimizing joins.\n\n```python\n["FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS", "AGGREGATE_CASE_TO_FILTER", "FILTER_INTO_JOIN", "PROJECT_FILTER_TRANSPOSE"]\n```', 'time': 3.8179776668548584}
