When the `LIMIT` clause is used to fetch a specified number of rows.\n2. When `ORDER BY` is used in conjunction with `LIMIT` to sort and limit the number of rows retrieved, particularly when sorting can leverage an index.\n3. When `DISTINCT` is used along with `LIMIT` to quickly identify and return unique rows without scanning the full dataset.\n4. During the use of `GROUP BY`, where optimization might involve sorting or traversing indexes in order to efficiently compute group values without processing the entire dataset.\n5. When sorting a specific number of rows from a single table based on non-indexed columns, utilizing in-memory sorting (`filesort`) techniques.\n**Transformations**: The specific SQL transformations that emerge from applying these optimization rules are:\n1. Combining `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY` encourages the database engine to stop the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained, avoiding full table sorts.\n2. Using `LIMIT` with `DISTINCT` leads to an early termination of the search for unique rows as soon as the needed amount is gathered, reducing time and resources spent on scanning the entire dataset.\n3. In the context of `GROUP BY`, optimizations may include indexing strategies or modifications to the way sorting is handled, such as employing `filesort` mechanisms that do not require temporary tables, ensuring that the database engine processes only the necessary data for group computations.\n4. Efficiencies are gained by encouraging the use of indexed columns with `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT`, making queries more efficient by reducing the cost associated with sorting and filtering operations.\n"""\nRule 3:\n"""\n**Conditions**: The SQL query rewrite rule applies when there are:\n- Functions or operations (especially deterministic ones) within the SELECT, WHERE, JOIN conditions, or any part of the query that is executed multiple times for the same row.\n- The presence of potentially computationally expensive operations or function calls that are not dependent on the data of the specific row and thus can be optimized.\n**Transformations**: 1. Move repeated function calls or operations outside of loops, if applicable. For example, if a function that generates a calculated value based on constants or parameters (not row-specific data) is being called in a loop, calculate the value once before the loop and store the result for reuse.\n   \n2. Replace inline functions in the SELECT or WHERE clause with a pre-calculated column if the function is deterministic and the input data does not change frequently. This might involve:\n   - Creating a temporary table that includes the results of the expensive function calls.\n   - Using a subquery or a Common Table Expression (CTE) that calculates the value once and then joins it with the main query.\n   \n3. When using aggregate functions that are called multiple times with the same parameters, consider storing the result in a variable or a temporary table, especially if the data set is large.\n\n4. Avoid using functions on indexed columns in the WHERE clause. This prevents the database from using the index efficiently. If a function must be used, consider creating a computed column that pre-calculates the function\'s result and index that column instead.\n\n5. If possible, simplify expressions and calculations to reduce their complexity and execution time. This might involve algebraic simplification or breaking down complex calculations into simpler parts that can be calculated separately and then combined.\n\nExample:\nOriginal Query:\n```sql\nSELECT id, name, expensive_function(column) as expensive_result\nFROM table\nWHERE expensive_function(column) > 100;\n```\n\nTransformed Query using a CTE:\n```sql\nWITH PreCalculated AS (\n  SELECT id, name, column, expensive_function(column) as expensive_result\n  FROM table\n)\nSELECT id, name, expensive_sel as expensive_result\nFROM PreCalculated\nWHERE expensive_result > 100;\n```\n"""'}], 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'stream': False, 'temperature': 0.1}}

The filter's expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there's a matching row in the non-preserving side's table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned.\n```\n\nLogical Plan Changes After Rewrite: ```\n  LogicalSort(sort0=[$4(ss_ext_sales_price)], sort1=[$1(i_brand)], sort2=[$0(i_brand_id)], sort3=[$2(i_manufact_id)], sort4=[$3(i_manufact)], dir0=[DESC], dir1=[ASC], dir2=[ASC], dir3=[ASC], dir4=[ASC], fetch=[100])\r\n    LogicalProject(brand_id=[$1(i_brand_id)], brand=[$0(i_brand)], i_manufact_id=[$2(i_manufact_id)], i_manufact=[$3(i_manufact)], ext_price=[$4(ss_ext_sales_price)])\r\n      LogicalAggregate(group=[{0, 1, 2, 3}], ext_price=[SUM($4)])\r\n        LogicalProject(brand=[$59(i_brand)], brand_id=[$58(i_brand_id)], i_manufact_id=[$64(i_manufact_id)], i_manufact=[$65(i_manufact)], ss_ext_sales_price=[$43(ss_ext_sales_price)])\r\n-         LogicalFilter(condition=[AND(=($0(d_date_sk), $28(ss_sold_date_sk)), =($30(ss_item_sk), $51(i_item_sk)), =($31(ss_customer_sk), $73(c_customer_sk)), =($77(c_current_addr_sk), $91(ca_address_sk)), =($35(ss_store_sk), $104(s_store_sk)), =(CAST($63(i_category)):CHAR(6), 'Sports'), =($6(d_year), 1999), =($8(d_moy), 3), <>(SUBSTRING($100(ca_zip), 1, 5), SUBSTRING($129(s_zip), 1, 5)), =(CAST($99(ca_state)):CHAR(2), 'OK'), =($85(c_birth_month), 11), >=($39(ss_wholesale_cost), 71), <=($39(ss_wholesale_cost), 91))])\r\n-           LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n+         LogicalJoin(condition=[AND(=($35(ss_store_sk), $104(s_store_sk)), <>(SUBSTRING($100(ca_zip), 1, 5), SUBSTRING($129(s_zip), 1, 5)))], joinType=[inner])\r\n+           LogicalJoin(condition=[=($77(c_current_addr_sk), $91(ca_address_sk))], joinType=[inner])\r\n-             LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n+             LogicalJoin(condition=[=($31(ss_customer_sk), $73(c_customer_sk))], joinType=[inner])\r\n?                                    ++++++++++++ +++ +++++++++++++ ++++ ++++++\n\n-               LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n?                                       --\n\n+               LogicalJoin(condition=[=($30(ss_item_sk), $51(i_item_sk))], joinType=[inner])\r\n?                                      ++++++++++  ++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n-                 LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n?                                         --\n\n+                 LogicalJoin(condition=[=($0(d_date_sk), $28(ss_sold_date_sk))], joinType=[inner])\r\n?                                        +++++++++  +++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n-                   LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n+                   LogicalFilter(condition=[AND(=($6(d_year), 1999), =($8(d_moy), 3))])\r\n                      LogicalTableScan(table=[[date_dim]])\r\n+                   LogicalFilter(condition=[SEARCH($11(ss_wholesale_cost), Sarg[[71..91]])])\r\n                      LogicalTableScan(table=[[store_sales]])\r\n+                 LogicalFilter(condition=[=(CAST($12(i_category)):CHAR(6), 'Sports')])\r\n                    LogicalTableScan(table=[[item]])\r\n+               LogicalFilter(condition=[=($12(c_birth_month), 11)])\r\n                  LogicalTableScan(table=[[customer]])\r\n+             LogicalFilter(condition=[=(CAST($8(ca_state)):CHAR(2), 'OK')])\r\n                LogicalTableScan(table=[[customer_address]])\r\n-             LogicalTableScan(table=[[store]])\r\n? --\n\n+           LogicalTableScan(table=[[store]])\r\n  \n```"}], 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'stream': False, 'temperature': 0.1}}

The original filter condition included `>=($39(ss_wholesale_cost), 71)` and `<=($39(ss_wholesale_cost), 91)`. After the rewrite, these two conditions were replaced with `SEARCH($39(ss_wholesale_cost), Sarg[[71..91]])`. This indicates a simplification of the range condition on `ss_wholesale_cost`.\n\nStep 2: Parsing the logical plan changes, the SQL query changes involve the simplification of the range condition on the `ss_wholesale_cost` column. Originally, the SQL query had two separate conditions: `ss_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 71 AND 91`. This was simplified to a single search condition `SEARCH($39(ss_wholesale_cost), Sarg[[71..91]])`, which is a more efficient representation for range queries.\n\nStep 3: The query rewrite rule contains multiple cases. The parsed SQL query changes match Case 3 of the query rewrite rule. Case 3 deals with simplifying complex conditions based on known constraints or logical simplification. The transformation involves simplifying the conditions according to logical rules, which is exactly what happened with the range condition on `ss_wholesale_cost`.\n\nStep 4: In this query rewrite process, the condition `ss_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 71 AND 91` was simplified to `SEARCH($39(ss_wholesale_cost), Sarg[[71..91]])`. This transformation falls under Case 3 of the query rewrite rule, where complex conditions are simplified. The simplification reduces redundancy and improves the efficiency of the query by using a more optimized representation for the range condition.

Specifically, the `LogicalAggregate` operation, which was initially applied after a `LogicalProject`, has been moved to occur before the `LogicalProject`. This suggests that the aggregation is now being applied directly to the data source, rather than after a projection.\n\nStep 2: Parsing the logical plan changes, we observe that the original `LogicalAggregate` was applied after a `LogicalProject` that selected specific columns (`i_brand`, `i_brand_id`, `i_manufact_id`, `i_manufact`, `ss_ext_sales_price`). In the rewritten plan, the `LogicalAggregate` is applied directly to these columns without an intermediate projection. The `LogicalProject` that follows the aggregation now simply renames the columns for the final output, matching the original query's `SELECT` clause.\n\nStep 3: The query rewrite rule contains two cases. Case 1 involves simplifying a query with a `GROUP BY` clause and direct aggregate functions, while Case 2 involves removing an unnecessary inner `SELECT` layer. The parsed changes indicate that the rewrite matches Case 1. The `GROUP BY` clause in the original query groups by simple columns, and the aggregate function (`SUM`) operates directly on a column (`ss_ext_sales_price`). The `SELECT` clause contains only the columns used in the `GROUP BY` and the aggregate function, without transformations.\n\nStep 4: In the context of Case 1, the SQL query changes can be explained as follows: The original query applied a `GROUP BY` and aggregation after projecting specific columns. The rewrite rule identified that the `GROUP BY` and aggregation could be applied directly to the data source, eliminating the need for an intermediate projection. This transformation optimizes the query by reducing the number of operations and directly applying the aggregation to the relevant data. The final `LogicalProject` simply renames the columns to match the original query's output, ensuring that the result set remains consistent with the original query's intent.", 'time': 4.428357124328613}

The filter's expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there's a matching row in the non-preserving side's table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned.\n```\n\nLogical Plan Changes After Rewrite: ```\n  LogicalSort(sort0=[$4(ss_ext_sales_price)], sort1=[$1(i_brand)], sort2=[$0(i_brand_id)], sort3=[$2(i_manufact_id)], sort4=[$3(i_manufact)], dir0=[DESC], dir1=[ASC], dir2=[ASC], dir3=[ASC], dir4=[ASC], fetch=[100])\r\n    LogicalProject(brand_id=[$1(i_brand_id)], brand=[$0(i_brand)], i_manufact_id=[$2(i_manufact_id)], i_manufact=[$3(i_manufact)], ext_price=[$4(ss_ext_sales_price)])\r\n      LogicalAggregate(group=[{0, 1, 2, 3}], ext_price=[SUM($4)])\r\n        LogicalProject(brand=[$59(i_brand)], brand_id=[$58(i_brand_id)], i_manufact_id=[$64(i_manufact_id)], i_manufact=[$65(i_manufact)], ss_ext_sales_price=[$43(ss_ext_sales_price)])\r\n-         LogicalFilter(condition=[AND(=($0(d_date_sk), $28(ss_sold_date_sk)), =($30(ss_item_sk), $51(i_item_sk)), =($31(ss_customer_sk), $73(c_customer_sk)), =($77(c_current_addr_sk), $91(ca_address_sk)), =($35(ss_store_sk), $104(s_store_sk)), =(CAST($63(i_category)):CHAR(6), 'Sports'), =($6(d_year), 1999), =($8(d_moy), 3), <>(SUBSTRING($100(ca_zip), 1, 5), SUBSTRING($129(s_zip), 1, 5)), =(CAST($99(ca_state)):CHAR(2), 'OK'), =($85(c_birth_month), 11), >=($39(ss_wholesale_cost), 71), <=($39(ss_wholesale_cost), 91))])\r\n-           LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n+         LogicalJoin(condition=[AND(=($35(ss_store_sk), $104(s_store_sk)), <>(SUBSTRING($100(ca_zip), 1, 5), SUBSTRING($129(s_zip), 1, 5)))], joinType=[inner])\r\n+           LogicalJoin(condition=[=($77(c_current_addr_sk), $91(ca_address_sk))], joinType=[inner])\r\n-             LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n+             LogicalJoin(condition=[=($31(ss_customer_sk), $73(c_customer_sk))], joinType=[inner])\r\n?                                    ++++++++++++ +++ +++++++++++++ ++++ ++++++\n\n-               LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n?                                       --\n\n+               LogicalJoin(condition=[=($30(ss_item_sk), $51(i_item_sk))], joinType=[inner])\r\n?                                      ++++++++++  ++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n-                 LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n?                                         --\n\n+                 LogicalJoin(condition=[=($0(d_date_sk), $28(ss_sold_date_sk))], joinType=[inner])\r\n?                                        +++++++++  +++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n-                   LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n+                   LogicalFilter(condition=[AND(=($6(d_year), 1999), =($8(d_moy), 3))])\r\n                      LogicalTableScan(table=[[date_dim]])\r\n+                   LogicalFilter(condition=[SEARCH($11(ss_wholesale_cost), Sarg[[71..91]])])\r\n                      LogicalTableScan(table=[[store_sales]])\r\n+                 LogicalFilter(condition=[=(CAST($12(i_category)):CHAR(6), 'Sports')])\r\n                    LogicalTableScan(table=[[item]])\r\n+               LogicalFilter(condition=[=($12(c_birth_month), 11)])\r\n                  LogicalTableScan(table=[[customer]])\r\n+             LogicalFilter(condition=[=(CAST($8(ca_state)):CHAR(2), 'OK')])\r\n                LogicalTableScan(table=[[customer_address]])\r\n-             LogicalTableScan(table=[[store]])\r\n? --\n\n+           LogicalTableScan(table=[[store]])\r\n  \n```"}], 'response': "Step 1: The logical plan changes indicate that several filter conditions have been moved from a single `LogicalFilter` node that applied to the entire result set of multiple `LogicalJoin` operations, to individual `LogicalFilter` nodes applied directly to specific tables before the joins. This suggests that the query rewrite rule has been applied to push down filter conditions closer to the data source tables, which can reduce the size of intermediate datasets and improve query performance.\n\nStep 2: Parsing the logical plan changes, we observe the following detailed changes:\n- The condition `=($0(d_date_sk), $28(ss_sold_date_sk))` has been moved into the `LogicalJoin` condition between `date_dim` and `store_sales`.\n- The condition `=($30(ss_item_sk), $51(i_item_sk))` has been moved into the `LogicalJoin` condition between `store_sales` and `item`.\n- The condition `=($31(ss_customer_sk), $73(c_customer_sk))` has been moved into the `LogicalJoin` condition between `store_sales` and `customer`.\n- The condition `=($77(c_current_addr_sk), $91(ca_address_sk))` has been moved into the `LogicalJoin` condition between `customer` and `customer_address`.\n- The condition `=($35(ss_store_sk), $104(s_store_sk))` and `<>(SUBSTRING($100(ca_zip), 1, 5), SUBSTRING($129(s_zip), 1, 5))` have been moved into the `LogicalJoin` condition between `store_sales` and `store`.\n- Filters such as `=(CAST($63(i_category)):CHAR(6), 'Sports')`, `=($6(d_year), 1999)`, `=($8(d_moy), 3)`, `SEARCH($11(ss_wholesale_cost), Sarg[[71..91]])`, `=($12(c_birth_month), 11)`, and `=(CAST($8(ca_state)):CHAR(2), 'OK')` have been applied directly to their respective tables (`item`, `date_dim`, `store_sales`, `customer`, `customer_address`).\n\nStep 3: The query rewrite rule contains multiple cases, but the changes observed in the logical plan align with Case 1. This case involves moving filter conditions that can be logically associated with columns from one side of an INNER JOIN into the ON clause of the join or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. The conditions moved in this query only involve columns from one side of their respective joins, matching the criteria for Case 1.\n\nStep 4: The SQL query changes can be explained by Case 1 of the query rewrite rule. The original query had a single `WHERE` clause with multiple conditions applied after several `INNER JOIN` operations. The rewrite rule identified conditions that could be logically associated with columns from one side of each join and moved them into the `ON` clause of the respective `INNER JOIN`. For example, the condition `=($0(d_date_sk), $28(ss_sold_date_sk))` was moved into the `ON` clause of the join between `date_dim` and `store_sales`, and similar transformations were applied to other joins. Additionally, conditions that only involved columns from a single table were applied directly to that table as `LogicalFilter` nodes, such as `=(CAST($63(i_category)):CHAR(6), 'Sports')` applied to `item`. This transformation optimizes the query by reducing the size of intermediate datasets before the joins, potentially improving performance.", 'time': 7.002906322479248}

For example, if a function that generates a calculated value based on constants or parameters (not row-specific data) is being called in a loop, calculate the value once before the loop and store the result for reuse.\n   \n2. Replace inline functions in the SELECT or WHERE clause with a pre-calculated column if the function is deterministic and the input data does not change frequently.

When using aggregate functions that are called multiple times with the same parameters, consider storing the result in a variable or a temporary table, especially if the data set is large.\n\n4.

For example, if a function that generates a calculated value based on constants or parameters (not row-specific data) is being called in a loop, calculate the value once before the loop and store the result for reuse.\n   \n2. Replace inline functions in the SELECT or WHERE clause with a pre-calculated column if the function is deterministic and the input data does not change frequently. This might involve:\n   - Creating a temporary table that includes the results of the expensive function calls.\n   - Using a subquery or a Common Table Expression (CTE) that calculates the value once and then joins it with the main query.\n   \n3. When using aggregate functions that are called multiple times with the same parameters, consider storing the result in a variable or a temporary table, especially if the data set is large.\n\n4. Avoid using functions on indexed columns in the WHERE clause. This prevents the database from using the index efficiently. If a function must be used, consider creating a computed column that pre-calculates the function\'s result and index that column instead.\n\n5.

In summary, the query can be optimized by pre-aggregating data before joins (Rule 1), ensuring efficient use of `LIMIT` and `ORDER BY` (Rule 2), and optimizing deterministic function calls (Rule 3).
05:21:45,143 root INFO Generated queries:
Query 1: The SQL query changes can be explained by Case 1 of the query rewrite rule. The original query had a single `WHERE` clause with multiple conditions applied after several `INNER JOIN` operations. The rewrite rule identified conditions that could be logically associated with columns from one side of each join and moved them into the `ON` clause of the respective `INNER JOIN`. For example, the condition `=($0(d_date_sk), $28(ss_sold_date_sk))` was moved into the `ON` clause of the join between `date_dim` and `store_sales`, and similar transformations were applied to other joins. Additionally, conditions that only involved columns from a single table were applied directly to that table as `LogicalFilter` nodes, such as `=(CAST($63(i_category)):CHAR(6), 'Sports')` applied to `item`. This transformation optimizes the query by reducing the size of intermediate datasets before the joins, potentially improving performance.
Query 2: In the context of Case 1, the SQL query changes can be explained as follows: The original query applied a `GROUP BY` and aggregation after projecting specific columns. The rewrite rule identified that the `GROUP BY` and aggregation could be applied directly to the data source, eliminating the need for an intermediate projection. This transformation optimizes the query by reducing the number of operations and directly applying the aggregation to the relevant data. The final `LogicalProject` simply renames the columns to match the original query's output, ensuring that the result set remains consistent with the original query's intent.
Query 3: In this query rewrite process, the condition `ss_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 71 AND 91` was simplified to `SEARCH($39(ss_wholesale_cost), Sarg[[71..91]])`. This transformation falls under Case 3 of the query rewrite rule, where complex conditions are simplified. The simplification reduces redundancy and improves the efficiency of the query by using a more optimized representation for the range condition. This change does not alter the semantics of the query but optimizes its execution.

Query Rewrite 1:
"""The SQL query changes can be explained by Case 1 of the query rewrite rule. The original query had a single `WHERE` clause with multiple conditions applied after several `INNER JOIN` operations. The rewrite rule identified conditions that could be logically associated with columns from one side of each join and moved them into the `ON` clause of the respective `INNER JOIN`. For example, the condition `=($0(d_date_sk), $28(ss_sold_date_sk))` was moved into the `ON` clause of the join between `date_dim` and `store_sales`, and similar transformations were applied to other joins. Additionally, conditions that only involved columns from a single table were applied directly to that table as `LogicalFilter` nodes, such as `=(CAST($63(i_category)):CHAR(6), 'Sports')` applied to `item`. This transformation optimizes the query by reducing the size of intermediate datasets before the joins, potentially improving performance."""

Query Rewrite 2:
"""In the context of Case 1, the SQL query changes can be explained as follows: The original query applied a `GROUP BY` and aggregation after projecting specific columns. The rewrite rule identified that the `GROUP BY` and aggregation could be applied directly to the data source, eliminating the need for an intermediate projection. This transformation optimizes the query by reducing the number of operations and directly applying the aggregation to the relevant data. The final `LogicalProject` simply renames the columns to match the original query's output, ensuring that the result set remains consistent with the original query's intent."""

Query Rewrite 3:
"""In this query rewrite process, the condition `ss_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 71 AND 91` was simplified to `SEARCH($39(ss_wholesale_cost), Sarg[[71..91]])`. This transformation falls under Case 3 of the query rewrite rule, where complex conditions are simplified. The simplification reduces redundancy and improves the efficiency of the query by using a more optimized representation for the range condition. This change does not alter the semantics of the query but optimizes its execution."""

The filter's expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there's a matching row in the non-preserving side's table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned."}, {'name': 'AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE', 'rewrite': 'Case 1:\n**Conditions**: - The SQL query contains a `GROUP BY` clause that groups by simple columns (no expressions in the `GROUP BY` list).\n- The aggregate functions in the `SELECT` clause operate directly on columns (no expressions inside the aggregate functions).\n- The `SELECT` clause only contains the columns used in the `GROUP BY` clause and the aggregates without any transformations or additional expressions.\n**Transformations**: - Directly apply the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions to the data source referred to in the `FROM` clause of the inner query before the projection.\n- Eliminate the outer projection layer if it only renames the columns without transforming them.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: - The `SELECT` clause of an outer query precisely matches the columns used in the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions of an inner query, without any column transformations or renamings.\n- The inner `SELECT` only serves as a passthrough for these columns.\n**Transformations**: - Remove the inner `SELECT` layer, directly applying the aggregate functions and `GROUP BY` to the original data source.'}, {'name': 'FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS', 'rewrite': "Case 1:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains conditions that can be statically determined as always true (e.g., constant expressions like `1=1` or tautologies based on the column data types and constraints), then these conditions don't affect the result set.\n**Transformations**: Remove such conditions from the WHERE clause.

The first strategy involves moving conditions from the `WHERE` clause into the `ON` clause of `INNER JOIN` operations, aligning conditions with their respective tables to reduce intermediate dataset sizes and improve performance. This includes applying conditions directly to single tables as `LogicalFilter` nodes, such as filtering the `item` table by category. The second strategy focuses on optimizing the `GROUP BY` and aggregation process by applying these operations directly to the data source, thus eliminating unnecessary intermediate projections and reducing the number of operations. Finally, the third strategy simplifies complex conditions, such as transforming the `ss_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 71 AND 91` condition into a more efficient `SEARCH` operation, which enhances query execution without altering its semantics. These strategies collectively aim to streamline the query execution process and improve performance."""\n\nQuery Rewrite Rules:\n### Rule FILTER_INTO_JOIN:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: This SQL query rewrite rule applies when a filter condition is placed on the result set of an INNER JOIN operation. The filter\'s expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there\'s a matching row in the non-preserving side\'s table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned."""\n\n### Rule AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: - The SQL query contains a `GROUP BY` clause that groups by simple columns (no expressions in the `GROUP BY` list).\n- The aggregate functions in the `SELECT` clause operate directly on columns (no expressions inside the aggregate functions).\n- The `SELECT` clause only contains the columns used in the `GROUP BY` clause and the aggregates without any transformations or additional expressions.\n**Transformations**: - Directly apply the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions to the data source referred to in the `FROM` clause of the inner query before the projection.\n- Eliminate the outer projection layer if it only renames the columns without transforming them.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: - The `SELECT` clause of an outer query precisely matches the columns used in the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions of an inner query, without any column transformations or renamings.\n- The inner `SELECT` only serves as a passthrough for these columns.\n**Transformations**: - Remove the inner `SELECT` layer, directly applying the aggregate functions and `GROUP BY` to the original data source."""\n\n### Rule FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains conditions that can be statically determined as always true (e.g., constant expressions like `1=1` or tautologies based on the column data types and constraints), then these conditions don\'t affect the result set.\n**Transformations**: Remove such conditions from the WHERE clause. If this results in an empty WHERE clause, remove the WHERE clause entirely.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause simplifies to conditions that are always false or involve comparisons with NULL in a way that the outcome is always false or NULL (e.g., `column != column` or `1=0`), indicating no rows can satisfy the filter.\n**Transformations**: Replace the query with one that selects no rows. This could be represented in different ways based on the SQL dialect. One universal method might be selecting from a dual table with a false condition.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains complex conditions that can be simplified based on known constraints, constants, or through logical simplification (e.g., `column IS NOT NULL AND column IS NOT NULL` simplifies to `column IS NOT NULL`).\n**Transformations**: Simplify the conditions according to logical rules and known constraints. Remove redundancy and unnecessary complexity."""\n\n### Rule SORT_PROJECT_TRANSPOSE:\n"""**Conditions**: If a SQL query executes a sort operation on columns that are directly referenced in the SELECT list or through expressions that are strictly monotonic transformations of these columns, and the sort operation directly follows these projections (SELECT statements), the sort operation can be pushed to operate directly on the table (FROM clause) before the projection.\n**Transformations**: 1. Check Compatibility: Ensure both sort and project (SELECT and ORDER BY clauses) involve compatible operations that relate directly to the raw column data or involve monotonic transformations.\n2. Analyze Order By Fields: Verify that each column in the ORDER BY clause is directly represented in the SELECT list or is a derived column through a monotonic transformation (e.g., casting integers to floats where the order is preserved).\n3. Adjust SQL Query: Rewrite the query so that sorting (ORDER BY clause) is applied to the raw table data in the FROM clause rather than after the projection. This might involve introducing a subquery or CTE (Common Table Expression) where the sorting is applied first, followed by the projections.\n4. Optimize Projection: Ensure that the SELECT list in the outer query matches the original projection, applying on top of the sorted data now."""\n\n### Rule PROJECT_FILTER_TRANSPOSE:\n"""**Conditions**: This rewrite rule can be applied when an SQL query contains a SELECT operation (acting as the `Project` operation) followed by a WHERE clause (acting as the `Filter` operation), provided that the SELECT does not contain window functions (such as RANK(), ROW_NUMBER(), etc.) and the columns selected do not affect the outcome of the WHERE clause.\n**Transformations**: To apply the rule, refactor the SQL query so that the conditions in the WHERE clause are evaluated before the columns are selected in the SELECT clause. This may involve moving computations or column transformations from the SELECT clause to a sub-query that the WHERE clause is applied on, ensuring the final SELECT clause on the outermost query matches the original query\'s expected outcome. - Before: SELECT col1, transformation_function(col2) FROM table WHERE condition; - After: SELECT col1, transformation_function(col2) FROM (SELECT col1, col2 FROM table WHERE condition) AS subquery;"""\n\n### Rule AGGREGATE_REDUCE_FUNCTIONS:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: any SELECT statement or subquery using the AVG aggregate function\n**Transformations**: AVG(x) as SUM(x) / COUNT(x)\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: computing the population standard deviation\n**Transformations**: STDDEV_POP(x) as the square root of (`SUM(x^2) - SUM(x)^2 / COUNT(x)`) / COUNT(x)\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: for the sample standard deviation computation\n**Transformations**: STDDEV_SAMP(x) as the square root of (`SUM(x^2) - SUM(x)^2 / COUNT(x)`) / (COUNT(x) - 1)\nCase 4:\n**Conditions**: for the population variance computation\n**Transformations**: VAR_POP(x) as (`SUM(x^2) - SUM(x)^2 / COUNT(x)`) / COUNT(x)\nCase 5:\n**Conditions**: for the sample variance computation\n**Transformations**: VAR_SAMP(x) as (`SUM(x^2) - SUM(x)^2 / COUNT(x)`) / (COUNT(x) - 1)\nCase 6:\n**Conditions**: to compute population covariance\n**Transformations**: COVAR_POP(x, y) by applying a formula involving SUM and COUNT\nCase 7:\n**Conditions**: using a formula for sample covariance\n**Transformations**: COVAR_SAMP(x, y) using a formula involving SUM, COUNT, and an adjustment for sample calculations\nCase 8:\n**Conditions**: for transforming REGR_SXX(x, y) and REGR_SYY(x, y)\n**Transformations**: into expressions involving the computation of VAR_POP(x) or VAR_POP(y) respectively, multiplied by REGR_COUNT(x, y)"""\n\n### Rule JOIN_TO_CORRELATE:\n"""**Conditions**: The join type is either INNER JOIN or LEFT JOIN.

Identify the INNER JOIN or LEFT JOIN condition in the SQL query. 2. Extract the ON clause representing the join condition. 3. For INNER JOIN: - Replace the INNER JOIN with a WHERE EXISTS clause, moving the original join condition into the WHERE clause of a subquery that selects from the right side table. Reference the left side columns as correlation variables in the subquery\'s WHERE clause. - Example Transformation: SELECT * FROM left_table INNER JOIN right_table ON left_table.id = right_table.foreign_id Becomes: SELECT * FROM left_table WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM right_table WHERE left_table.id = right_table.foreign_id) 4.

The filter\'s expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there\'s a matching row in the non-preserving side\'s table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned."""\n\n### Rule AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: - The SQL query contains a `GROUP BY` clause that groups by simple columns (no expressions in the `GROUP BY` list).\n- The aggregate functions in the `SELECT` clause operate directly on columns (no expressions inside the aggregate functions).\n- The `SELECT` clause only contains the columns used in the `GROUP BY` clause and the aggregates without any transformations or additional expressions.\n**Transformations**: - Directly apply the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions to the data source referred to in the `FROM` clause of the inner query before the projection.\n- Eliminate the outer projection layer if it only renames the columns without transforming them.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: - The `SELECT` clause of an outer query precisely matches the columns used in the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions of an inner query, without any column transformations or renamings.\n- The inner `SELECT` only serves as a passthrough for these columns.\n**Transformations**: - Remove the inner `SELECT` layer, directly applying the aggregate functions and `GROUP BY` to the original data source."""\n\n### Rule FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains conditions that can be statically determined as always true (e.g., constant expressions like `1=1` or tautologies based on the column data types and constraints), then these conditions don\'t affect the result set.\n**Transformations**: Remove such conditions from the WHERE clause. If this results in an empty WHERE clause, remove the WHERE clause entirely.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause simplifies to conditions that are always false or involve comparisons with NULL in a way that the outcome is always false or NULL (e.g., `column != column` or `1=0`), indicating no rows can satisfy the filter.\n**Transformations**: Replace the query with one that selects no rows. This could be represented in different ways based on the SQL dialect. One universal method might be selecting from a dual table with a false condition.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains complex conditions that can be simplified based on known constraints, constants, or through logical simplification (e.g., `column IS NOT NULL AND column IS NOT NULL` simplifies to `column IS NOT NULL`).\n**Transformations**: Simplify the conditions according to logical rules and known constraints.

The first strategy involves moving conditions from the `WHERE` clause into the `ON` clause of `INNER JOIN` operations, aligning conditions with their respective tables to reduce intermediate dataset sizes and improve performance. This includes applying conditions directly to single tables as `LogicalFilter` nodes, such as filtering the `item` table by category. The second strategy focuses on optimizing the `GROUP BY` and aggregation process by applying these operations directly to the data source, thus eliminating unnecessary intermediate projections and reducing the number of operations. Finally, the third strategy simplifies complex conditions, such as transforming the `ss_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 71 AND 91` condition into a more efficient `SEARCH` operation, which enhances query execution without altering its semantics. These strategies collectively aim to streamline the query execution process and improve performance."""\n\nQuery Rewrite Rules:\n### Rule FILTER_INTO_JOIN:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: This SQL query rewrite rule applies when a filter condition is placed on the result set of an INNER JOIN operation. The filter\'s expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there\'s a matching row in the non-preserving side\'s table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned."""\n\n### Rule AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: - The SQL query contains a `GROUP BY` clause that groups by simple columns (no expressions in the `GROUP BY` list).\n- The aggregate functions in the `SELECT` clause operate directly on columns (no expressions inside the aggregate functions).\n- The `SELECT` clause only contains the columns used in the `GROUP BY` clause and the aggregates without any transformations or additional expressions.\n**Transformations**: - Directly apply the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions to the data source referred to in the `FROM` clause of the inner query before the projection.\n- Eliminate the outer projection layer if it only renames the columns without transforming them.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: - The `SELECT` clause of an outer query precisely matches the columns used in the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions of an inner query, without any column transformations or renamings.\n- The inner `SELECT` only serves as a passthrough for these columns.\n**Transformations**: - Remove the inner `SELECT` layer, directly applying the aggregate functions and `GROUP BY` to the original data source."""\n\n### Rule FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains conditions that can be statically determined as always true (e.g., constant expressions like `1=1` or tautologies based on the column data types and constraints), then these conditions don\'t affect the result set.\n**Transformations**: Remove such conditions from the WHERE clause. If this results in an empty WHERE clause, remove the WHERE clause entirely.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause simplifies to conditions that are always false or involve comparisons with NULL in a way that the outcome is always false or NULL (e.g., `column != column` or `1=0`), indicating no rows can satisfy the filter.\n**Transformations**: Replace the query with one that selects no rows. This could be represented in different ways based on the SQL dialect. One universal method might be selecting from a dual table with a false condition.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains complex conditions that can be simplified based on known constraints, constants, or through logical simplification (e.g., `column IS NOT NULL AND column IS NOT NULL` simplifies to `column IS NOT NULL`).\n**Transformations**: Simplify the conditions according to logical rules and known constraints. Remove redundancy and unnecessary complexity."""\n\nRule Subset Sequences:\n### Rule Sequence 1: ["FILTER_INTO_JOIN", "FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS"]\n\n### Rule Sequence 2: ["FILTER_INTO_JOIN"]\n\n### Rule Sequence 3: ["AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE"]\n\n### Rule Sequence 4: ["AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE"]'}], 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'stream': False, 'temperature': 0.1}}

For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned."""\n\n### Rule AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: - The SQL query contains a `GROUP BY` clause that groups by simple columns (no expressions in the `GROUP BY` list).\n- The aggregate functions in the `SELECT` clause operate directly on columns (no expressions inside the aggregate functions).\n- The `SELECT` clause only contains the columns used in the `GROUP BY` clause and the aggregates without any transformations or additional expressions.\n**Transformations**: - Directly apply the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions to the data source referred to in the `FROM` clause of the inner query before the projection.\n- Eliminate the outer projection layer if it only renames the columns without transforming them.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: - The `SELECT` clause of an outer query precisely matches the columns used in the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions of an inner query, without any column transformations or renamings.\n- The inner `SELECT` only serves as a passthrough for these columns.\n**Transformations**: - Remove the inner `SELECT` layer, directly applying the aggregate functions and `GROUP BY` to the original data source."""\n\n### Rule FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains conditions that can be statically determined as always true (e.g., constant expressions like `1=1` or tautologies based on the column data types and constraints), then these conditions don\'t affect the result set.\n**Transformations**: Remove such conditions from the WHERE clause.

The first strategy involves moving conditions from the `WHERE` clause into the `ON` clause of `INNER JOIN` operations, aligning conditions with their respective tables to reduce intermediate dataset sizes and improve performance. This includes applying conditions directly to single tables as `LogicalFilter` nodes, such as filtering the `item` table by category. The second strategy focuses on optimizing the `GROUP BY` and aggregation process by applying these operations directly to the data source, thus eliminating unnecessary intermediate projections and reducing the number of operations. Finally, the third strategy simplifies complex conditions, such as transforming the `ss_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 71 AND 91` condition into a more efficient `SEARCH` operation, which enhances query execution without altering its semantics. These strategies collectively aim to streamline the query execution process and improve performance."""\n\nQuery Rewrite Rules:\n### Rule FILTER_INTO_JOIN:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: This SQL query rewrite rule applies when a filter condition is placed on the result set of an INNER JOIN operation. The filter\'s expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN.
