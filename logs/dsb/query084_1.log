When the `LIMIT` clause is used to fetch a specified number of rows.\n2. When `ORDER BY` is used in conjunction with `LIMIT` to sort and limit the number of rows retrieved, particularly when sorting can leverage an index.\n3. When `DISTINCT` is used along with `LIMIT` to quickly identify and return unique rows without scanning the full dataset.\n4. During the use of `GROUP BY`, where optimization might involve sorting or traversing indexes in order to efficiently compute group values without processing the entire dataset.\n5. When sorting a specific number of rows from a single table based on non-indexed columns, utilizing in-memory sorting (`filesort`) techniques.\n**Transformations**: The specific SQL transformations that emerge from applying these optimization rules are:\n1. Combining `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY` encourages the database engine to stop the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained, avoiding full table sorts.\n2. Using `LIMIT` with `DISTINCT` leads to an early termination of the search for unique rows as soon as the needed amount is gathered, reducing time and resources spent on scanning the entire dataset.\n3. In the context of `GROUP BY`, optimizations may include indexing strategies or modifications to the way sorting is handled, such as employing `filesort` mechanisms that do not require temporary tables, ensuring that the database engine processes only the necessary data for group computations.\n4. Efficiencies are gained by encouraging the use of indexed columns with `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT`, making queries more efficient by reducing the cost associated with sorting and filtering operations.\n"""\nRule 2:\n"""\n**Conditions**: The SQL query rewrite rule applies when there are:\n- Functions or operations (especially deterministic ones) within the SELECT, WHERE, JOIN conditions, or any part of the query that is executed multiple times for the same row.\n- The presence of potentially computationally expensive operations or function calls that are not dependent on the data of the specific row and thus can be optimized.\n**Transformations**: 1. Move repeated function calls or operations outside of loops, if applicable. For example, if a function that generates a calculated value based on constants or parameters (not row-specific data) is being called in a loop, calculate the value once before the loop and store the result for reuse.\n   \n2. Replace inline functions in the SELECT or WHERE clause with a pre-calculated column if the function is deterministic and the input data does not change frequently. This might involve:\n   - Creating a temporary table that includes the results of the expensive function calls.\n   - Using a subquery or a Common Table Expression (CTE) that calculates the value once and then joins it with the main query.\n   \n3. When using aggregate functions that are called multiple times with the same parameters, consider storing the result in a variable or a temporary table, especially if the data set is large.\n\n4. Avoid using functions on indexed columns in the WHERE clause. This prevents the database from using the index efficiently. If a function must be used, consider creating a computed column that pre-calculates the function\'s result and index that column instead.\n\n5. If possible, simplify expressions and calculations to reduce their complexity and execution time. This might involve algebraic simplification or breaking down complex calculations into simpler parts that can be calculated separately and then combined.\n\nExample:\nOriginal Query:\n```sql\nSELECT id, name, expensive_function(column) as expensive_result\nFROM table\nWHERE expensive_function(column) > 100;\n```\n\nTransformed Query using a CTE:\n```sql\nWITH PreCalculated AS (\n  SELECT id, name, column, expensive_function(column) as expensive_result\n  FROM table\n)\nSELECT id, name, expensive_sel as expensive_result\nFROM PreCalculated\nWHERE expensive_result > 100;\n```\n"""'}], 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'stream': False, 'temperature': 0.1}}

The filter's expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there's a matching row in the non-preserving side's table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned.\n```\n\nLogical Plan Changes After Rewrite: ```\n  LogicalSort(sort0=[$0(c_customer_id)], dir0=[ASC], fetch=[100])\r\n    LogicalProject(customer_id=[$1(c_customer_id)], customername=[||(||(CASE(IS NOT NULL($9(c_last_name)), CAST($9(c_last_name)):CHAR(0) NOT NULL, ''), ', '), CASE(IS NOT NULL($8(c_first_name)), CAST($8(c_first_name)):CHAR(0) NOT NULL, ''))])\r\n+     LogicalJoin(condition=[=($52(sr_cdemo_sk), $31(cd_demo_sk))], joinType=[inner])\r\n+       LogicalJoin(condition=[=($45(ib_income_band_sk), $41(hd_income_band_sk))], joinType=[inner])\r\n+         LogicalJoin(condition=[=($40(hd_demo_sk), $3(c_current_hdemo_sk))], joinType=[inner])\r\n+           LogicalJoin(condition=[=($31(cd_demo_sk), $2(c_current_cdemo_sk))], joinType=[inner])\r\n+             LogicalJoin(condition=[=($4(c_current_addr_sk), $18(ca_address_sk))], joinType=[inner])\r\n-     LogicalFilter(condition=[AND(=(CAST($24(ca_city)):VARCHAR(12), 'Walnut Grove'), =($4(c_current_addr_sk), $18(ca_address_sk)), >=($46(ib_lower_bound), 46206), <=($47(ib_upper_bound), +(46206, 50000)), =($45(ib_income_band_sk), $41(hd_income_band_sk)), =($31(cd_demo_sk), $2(c_current_cdemo_sk)), =($40(hd_demo_sk), $3(c_current_hdemo_sk)), =($52(sr_cdemo_sk), $31(cd_demo_sk)))])\r\n-       LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n-         LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n-           LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n-             LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n-               LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n-                 LogicalTableScan(table=[[customer]])\r\n? --\n\n+               LogicalTableScan(table=[[customer]])\r\n+               LogicalFilter(condition=[=(CAST($6(ca_city)):VARCHAR(12), 'Walnut Grove')])\r\n                  LogicalTableScan(table=[[customer_address]])\r\n-               LogicalTableScan(table=[[customer_demographics]])\r\n? --\n\n+             LogicalTableScan(table=[[customer_demographics]])\r\n-             LogicalTableScan(table=[[household_demographics]])\r\n? --\n\n+           LogicalTableScan(table=[[household_demographics]])\r\n+         LogicalFilter(condition=[AND(>=($1(ib_lower_bound), 46206), <=($2(ib_upper_bound), +(46206, 50000)))])\r\n            LogicalTableScan(table=[[income_band]])\r\n-         LogicalTableScan(table=[[store_returns]])\r\n? --\n\n+       LogicalTableScan(table=[[store_returns]])\r\n  \n```"}], 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'stream': False, 'temperature': 0.1}}

When sorting a specific number of rows from a single table based on non-indexed columns, utilizing in-memory sorting (`filesort`) techniques.\n**Transformations**: The specific SQL transformations that emerge from applying these optimization rules are:\n1. Combining `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY` encourages the database engine to stop the sorting process as soon as the required number of rows is obtained, avoiding full table sorts.\n2. Using `LIMIT` with `DISTINCT` leads to an early termination of the search for unique rows as soon as the needed amount is gathered, reducing time and resources spent on scanning the entire dataset.\n3. In the context of `GROUP BY`, optimizations may include indexing strategies or modifications to the way sorting is handled, such as employing `filesort` mechanisms that do not require temporary tables, ensuring that the database engine processes only the necessary data for group computations.\n4. Efficiencies are gained by encouraging the use of indexed columns with `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT`, making queries more efficient by reducing the cost associated with sorting and filtering operations.\n"""\nRule 2:\n"""\n**Conditions**: The SQL query rewrite rule applies when there are:\n- Functions or operations (especially deterministic ones) within the SELECT, WHERE, JOIN conditions, or any part of the query that is executed multiple times for the same row.\n- The presence of potentially computationally expensive operations or function calls that are not dependent on the data of the specific row and thus can be optimized.\n**Transformations**: 1. Move repeated function calls or operations outside of loops, if applicable. For example, if a function that generates a calculated value based on constants or parameters (not row-specific data) is being called in a loop, calculate the value once before the loop and store the result for reuse.\n   \n2. Replace inline functions in the SELECT or WHERE clause with a pre-calculated column if the function is deterministic and the input data does not change frequently. This might involve:\n   - Creating a temporary table that includes the results of the expensive function calls.\n   - Using a subquery or a Common Table Expression (CTE) that calculates the value once and then joins it with the main query.\n   \n3. When using aggregate functions that are called multiple times with the same parameters, consider storing the result in a variable or a temporary table, especially if the data set is large.\n\n4. Avoid using functions on indexed columns in the WHERE clause. This prevents the database from using the index efficiently. If a function must be used, consider creating a computed column that pre-calculates the function\'s result and index that column instead.\n\n5. If possible, simplify expressions and calculations to reduce their complexity and execution time. This might involve algebraic simplification or breaking down complex calculations into simpler parts that can be calculated separately and then combined.\n\nExample:\nOriginal Query:\n```sql\nSELECT id, name, expensive_function(column) as expensive_result\nFROM table\nWHERE expensive_function(column) > 100;\n```\n\nTransformed Query using a CTE:\n```sql\nWITH PreCalculated AS (\n  SELECT id, name, column, expensive_function(column) as expensive_result\n  FROM table\n)\nSELECT id, name, expensive_sel as expensive_result\nFROM PreCalculated\nWHERE expensive_result > 100;\n```\n"""'}], 'response': 'Step 1: Analyze the given SQL query against each rewrite rule\'s conditions.\n\n- **Rule 1 Conditions**:\n  1.

The filter's expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there's a matching row in the non-preserving side's table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned.\n```\n\nLogical Plan Changes After Rewrite: ```\n  LogicalSort(sort0=[$0(c_customer_id)], dir0=[ASC], fetch=[100])\r\n    LogicalProject(customer_id=[$1(c_customer_id)], customername=[||(||(CASE(IS NOT NULL($9(c_last_name)), CAST($9(c_last_name)):CHAR(0) NOT NULL, ''), ', '), CASE(IS NOT NULL($8(c_first_name)), CAST($8(c_first_name)):CHAR(0) NOT NULL, ''))])\r\n+     LogicalJoin(condition=[=($52(sr_cdemo_sk), $31(cd_demo_sk))], joinType=[inner])\r\n+       LogicalJoin(condition=[=($45(ib_income_band_sk), $41(hd_income_band_sk))], joinType=[inner])\r\n+         LogicalJoin(condition=[=($40(hd_demo_sk), $3(c_current_hdemo_sk))], joinType=[inner])\r\n+           LogicalJoin(condition=[=($31(cd_demo_sk), $2(c_current_cdemo_sk))], joinType=[inner])\r\n+             LogicalJoin(condition=[=($4(c_current_addr_sk), $18(ca_address_sk))], joinType=[inner])\r\n-     LogicalFilter(condition=[AND(=(CAST($24(ca_city)):VARCHAR(12), 'Walnut Grove'), =($4(c_current_addr_sk), $18(ca_address_sk)), >=($46(ib_lower_bound), 46206), <=($47(ib_upper_bound), +(46206, 50000)), =($45(ib_income_band_sk), $41(hd_income_band_sk)), =($31(cd_demo_sk), $2(c_current_cdemo_sk)), =($40(hd_demo_sk), $3(c_current_hdemo_sk)), =($52(sr_cdemo_sk), $31(cd_demo_sk)))])\r\n-       LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n-         LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n-           LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n-             LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n-               LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n-                 LogicalTableScan(table=[[customer]])\r\n? --\n\n+               LogicalTableScan(table=[[customer]])\r\n+               LogicalFilter(condition=[=(CAST($6(ca_city)):VARCHAR(12), 'Walnut Grove')])\r\n                  LogicalTableScan(table=[[customer_address]])\r\n-               LogicalTableScan(table=[[customer_demographics]])\r\n? --\n\n+             LogicalTableScan(table=[[customer_demographics]])\r\n-             LogicalTableScan(table=[[household_demographics]])\r\n? --\n\n+           LogicalTableScan(table=[[household_demographics]])\r\n+         LogicalFilter(condition=[AND(>=($1(ib_lower_bound), 46206), <=($2(ib_upper_bound), +(46206, 50000)))])\r\n            LogicalTableScan(table=[[income_band]])\r\n-         LogicalTableScan(table=[[store_returns]])\r\n? --\n\n+       LogicalTableScan(table=[[store_returns]])\r\n  \n```"}], 'response': "Step 1: The logical plan changes indicate that the original query's filter conditions, which were initially applied in a `LogicalFilter` node, have been moved into the `LogicalJoin` nodes. The original plan had a `LogicalFilter` with multiple conditions applied after a series of `LogicalJoin` operations with `true` conditions, indicating cross joins. In the rewritten plan, these conditions have been incorporated into the `LogicalJoin` nodes as part of their join conditions, effectively converting them from cross joins to inner joins.\n\nStep 2: Parsing the logical plan changes, we see that the following SQL query changes occurred:\n- The condition `ca_city = 'Walnut Grove'` was moved from the `WHERE` clause to a `LogicalFilter` directly on the `customer_address` table.\n- The conditions `c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk`, `cd_demo_sk = c_current_cdemo_sk`, `hd_demo_sk = c_current_hdemo_sk`, `sr_cdemo_sk = cd_demo_sk`, and `ib_income_band_sk = hd_income_band_sk` were moved from the `WHERE` clause to the `ON` clauses of the respective `INNER JOIN` operations.\n- The conditions `ib_lower_bound >= 46206` and `ib_upper_bound <= 46206 + 50000` were moved from the `WHERE` clause to a `LogicalFilter` directly on the `income_band` table.\n\nStep 3: The query rewrite rule contains multiple cases. Based on the parsed SQL query changes, the matched case is Case 1. This is because the filter conditions were originally applied to the result set of INNER JOIN operations and were moved to the ON clauses of these joins. The conditions involved only columns from one side of the join, allowing them to be logically applied to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n\nStep 4: In Case 1, the SQL query rewrite rule specifies that if a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join, these conditions should be moved into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN. In this query, conditions such as `c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk` and `ca_city = 'Walnut Grove'` were moved to the ON clause of the join between `customer` and `customer_address`. Similarly, conditions like `ib_lower_bound >= 46206` and `ib_upper_bound <= 46206 + 50000` were moved to a filter on the `income_band` table.

Query 1: In Case 1, the SQL query rewrite rule specifies that if a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join, these conditions should be moved into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN. In this query, conditions such as `c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk` and `ca_city = 'Walnut Grove'` were moved to the ON clause of the join between `customer` and `customer_address`. Similarly, conditions like `ib_lower_bound >= 46206` and `ib_upper_bound <= 46206 + 50000` were moved to a filter on the `income_band` table. This transformation optimizes the query by reducing the number of rows processed in the joins, as the filtering is applied earlier in the execution plan.
Query 2: The SQL query change involved simplifying the condition `ib_upper_bound <= 46206 + 50000` to `ib_upper_bound <= 96206`. This simplification falls under Case 3 of the query rewrite rule, where complex conditions are simplified by evaluating constant expressions. The arithmetic operation `46206 + 50000` was computed to yield `96206`, thus removing unnecessary complexity from the WHERE clause. This simplification does not alter the logic of the query but makes it more efficient by reducing the computational overhead during query execution.
Query 3: The SQL query uses `LIMIT` in conjunction with `ORDER BY`, which matches Rule 1's conditions. The transformation encourages the database engine to optimize the sorting process by stopping as soon as the required number of rows is obtained. This avoids a full table sort, which can be resource-intensive.

In this case, the transformation does not require any changes to the SQL syntax itself but relies on the database engine's internal optimization mechanisms. The database engine will attempt to use an index on `c_customer_id` if available, or employ an efficient in-memory sorting technique to quickly retrieve the top 100 rows sorted by `c_customer_id`.

Thus, the query remains the same, but the execution plan is optimized by the database engine to efficiently handle the `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT` combination.

Query Rewrite 1:
"""In Case 1, the SQL query rewrite rule specifies that if a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join, these conditions should be moved into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN. In this query, conditions such as `c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk` and `ca_city = 'Walnut Grove'` were moved to the ON clause of the join between `customer` and `customer_address`. Similarly, conditions like `ib_lower_bound >= 46206` and `ib_upper_bound <= 46206 + 50000` were moved to a filter on the `income_band` table. This transformation optimizes the query by reducing the number of rows processed in the joins, as the filtering is applied earlier in the execution plan."""

Query Rewrite 2:
"""The SQL query change involved simplifying the condition `ib_upper_bound <= 46206 + 50000` to `ib_upper_bound <= 96206`. This simplification falls under Case 3 of the query rewrite rule, where complex conditions are simplified by evaluating constant expressions. The arithmetic operation `46206 + 50000` was computed to yield `96206`, thus removing unnecessary complexity from the WHERE clause. This simplification does not alter the logic of the query but makes it more efficient by reducing the computational overhead during query execution."""

Query Rewrite 3:
"""The SQL query uses `LIMIT` in conjunction with `ORDER BY`, which matches Rule 1's conditions. The transformation encourages the database engine to optimize the sorting process by stopping as soon as the required number of rows is obtained. This avoids a full table sort, which can be resource-intensive.

In this case, the transformation does not require any changes to the SQL syntax itself but relies on the database engine's internal optimization mechanisms. The database engine will attempt to use an index on `c_customer_id` if available, or employ an efficient in-memory sorting technique to quickly retrieve the top 100 rows sorted by `c_customer_id`.

Thus, the query remains the same, but the execution plan is optimized by the database engine to efficiently handle the `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT` combination."""

Optimize Projection: Ensure that the SELECT list in the outer query matches the original projection, applying on top of the sorted data now."""\n\n### Rule PROJECT_FILTER_TRANSPOSE:\n"""**Conditions**: This rewrite rule can be applied when an SQL query contains a SELECT operation (acting as the `Project` operation) followed by a WHERE clause (acting as the `Filter` operation), provided that the SELECT does not contain window functions (such as RANK(), ROW_NUMBER(), etc.) and the columns selected do not affect the outcome of the WHERE clause.\n**Transformations**: To apply the rule, refactor the SQL query so that the conditions in the WHERE clause are evaluated before the columns are selected in the SELECT clause. This may involve moving computations or column transformations from the SELECT clause to a sub-query that the WHERE clause is applied on, ensuring the final SELECT clause on the outermost query matches the original query\'s expected outcome. - Before: SELECT col1, transformation_function(col2) FROM table WHERE condition; - After: SELECT col1, transformation_function(col2) FROM (SELECT col1, col2 FROM table WHERE condition) AS subquery;"""\n\n### Rule JOIN_TO_CORRELATE:\n"""**Conditions**: The join type is either INNER JOIN or LEFT JOIN. There are no requirements in the query that would inherently create NULL values on the left side when there are no matching rows on the right side (for INNER JOIN, this condition is naturally met; for LEFT JOIN, it is met if every row on the left side has at least one corresponding row on the right side according to the join condition).\n**Transformations**: 1. Identify the INNER JOIN or LEFT JOIN condition in the SQL query. 2. Extract the ON clause representing the join condition. 3. For INNER JOIN: - Replace the INNER JOIN with a WHERE EXISTS clause, moving the original join condition into the WHERE clause of a subquery that selects from the right side table. Reference the left side columns as correlation variables in the subquery\'s WHERE clause. - Example Transformation: SELECT * FROM left_table INNER JOIN right_table ON left_table.id = right_table.foreign_id Becomes: SELECT * FROM left_table WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM right_table WHERE left_table.id = right_table.foreign_id) 4. For LEFT JOIN: - Replace the LEFT JOIN with a LEFT OUTER JOIN subquery that is correlated to the outer query. In the SELECT clause of the outer query, include a CASE statement or similar logic to handle selection from the subquery result. - Example Transformation: SELECT left_table.*, right_table.* FROM left_table LEFT JOIN right_table ON left_table.id = right_table.foreign_id Becomes: SELECT left_table.*, COALESCE(subquery.alias1, \'default\') FROM left_table LEFT OUTER JOIN (SELECT foreign_id, column1 AS alias1 FROM right_table) subquery ON left_table.id = subquery.foreign_id"""'}], 'response': 'Step 1: Evaluate each suggestion against the query rewrite rules.\n\n### Suggestion 1:\n1. **Move conditions to the ON clause of the INNER JOIN**: \n   - The suggestion to move conditions like `c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk` and `ca_city = \'Walnut Grove\'` to the ON clause aligns with **Rule FILTER_INTO_JOIN**.

The filter\'s expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there\'s a matching row in the non-preserving side\'s table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned."""\n\n### Rule FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains conditions that can be statically determined as always true (e.g., constant expressions like `1=1` or tautologies based on the column data types and constraints), then these conditions don\'t affect the result set.\n**Transformations**: Remove such conditions from the WHERE clause. If this results in an empty WHERE clause, remove the WHERE clause entirely.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause simplifies to conditions that are always false or involve comparisons with NULL in a way that the outcome is always false or NULL (e.g., `column != column` or `1=0`), indicating no rows can satisfy the filter.\n**Transformations**: Replace the query with one that selects no rows. This could be represented in different ways based on the SQL dialect.

Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN.

This reduces the number of rows processed during the join operation, which can significantly improve performance. In the given query, conditions like `c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk` and `ca_city = \'Walnut Grove\'` can be moved into the ON clause of the join between `customer` and `customer_address`. Similarly, conditions on `income_band` can be applied directly to reduce the dataset size before joining.\n\n2. **FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS**: After applying the FILTER_INTO_JOIN rule, we should simplify any complex expressions. For instance, the condition `ib_upper_bound <= 46206 + 50000` can be simplified to `ib_upper_bound <= 96206`.

Firstly, conditions that are logically associated with columns from one side of a join, such as `c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk` and `ca_city = \'Walnut Grove\'`, should be moved to the ON clause of the INNER JOIN to reduce the number of rows processed during joins. Similarly, filtering conditions like `ib_lower_bound >= 46206` and `ib_upper_bound <= 46206 + 50000` should be applied directly to the `income_band` table to optimize the query execution plan by applying filters earlier. Secondly, simplifying complex conditions by evaluating constant expressions, such as changing `ib_upper_bound <= 46206 + 50000` to `ib_upper_bound <= 96206`, reduces computational overhead without altering the query logic. Lastly, the use of `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY` allows the database engine to optimize the sorting process by stopping once the required number of rows is retrieved, potentially using an index on `c_customer_id` or efficient in-memory sorting techniques. These strategies collectively enhance the query\'s performance by optimizing the execution plan and reducing unnecessary computations."""\n\nQuery Rewrite Rules:\n### Rule FILTER_INTO_JOIN:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: This SQL query rewrite rule applies when a filter condition is placed on the result set of an INNER JOIN operation. The filter\'s expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there\'s a matching row in the non-preserving side\'s table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned."""\n\n### Rule FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains conditions that can be statically determined as always true (e.g., constant expressions like `1=1` or tautologies based on the column data types and constraints), then these conditions don\'t affect the result set.\n**Transformations**: Remove such conditions from the WHERE clause. If this results in an empty WHERE clause, remove the WHERE clause entirely.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause simplifies to conditions that are always false or involve comparisons with NULL in a way that the outcome is always false or NULL (e.g., `column != column` or `1=0`), indicating no rows can satisfy the filter.\n**Transformations**: Replace the query with one that selects no rows. This could be represented in different ways based on the SQL dialect. One universal method might be selecting from a dual table with a false condition.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains complex conditions that can be simplified based on known constraints, constants, or through logical simplification (e.g., `column IS NOT NULL AND column IS NOT NULL` simplifies to `column IS NOT NULL`).\n**Transformations**: Simplify the conditions according to logical rules and known constraints. Remove redundancy and unnecessary complexity."""\n\nArranged Rule Sequence: ["FILTER_INTO_JOIN", "FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS"]\n\nUtilized Rules: ["FILTER_INTO_JOIN", "FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS"]\n\nUnutilized Rules: []'}], 'response': 'Step 1: In the provided arrangement, all rules were utilized, and there are no unutilized rules.
