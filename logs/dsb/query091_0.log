The filter's expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there's a matching row in the non-preserving side's table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned.\n```\n\nLogical Plan Changes After Rewrite: ```\n  LogicalSort(sort0=[$3(cr_net_loss)], dir0=[DESC])\r\n    LogicalProject(call_center=[$0(cc_call_center_id)], call_center_name=[$1(cc_name)], manager=[$2(cc_manager)], returns_loss=[$5(cr_net_loss)])\r\n      LogicalAggregate(group=[{0, 1, 2, 3, 4}], returns_loss=[SUM($5)])\r\n        LogicalProject(call_center=[$1(cc_call_center_id)], call_center_name=[$6(cc_name)], manager=[$11(cc_manager)], cd_marital_status=[$119(cd_marital_status)], cd_education_status=[$120(cd_education_status)], cr_net_loss=[$57(cr_net_loss)])\r\n-         LogicalFilter(condition=[AND(=($42(cr_call_center_sk), $0(cc_call_center_sk)), =($31(cr_returned_date_sk), $58(d_date_sk)), =($38(cr_returning_customer_sk), $86(c_customer_sk)), =($117(cd_demo_sk), $88(c_current_cdemo_sk)), =($126(hd_demo_sk), $89(c_current_hdemo_sk)), =($104(ca_address_sk), $90(c_current_addr_sk)), =($64(d_year), 2000), =($66(d_moy), 3), OR(AND(=(CAST($119(cd_marital_status)):CHAR(1), 'M'), =(CAST($120(cd_education_status)):CHAR(7), 'Unknown')), AND(=(CAST($119(cd_marital_status)):CHAR(1), 'W'), =(CAST($120(cd_education_status)):CHAR(15), 'Advanced Degree'))), LIKE($128(hd_buy_potential), '501-1000%'), =(CAST($115(ca_gmt_offset)):DECIMAL(12, 2), -7))])\r\n-           LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n-             LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n-               LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n+         LogicalJoin(condition=[=($126(hd_demo_sk), $89(c_current_hdemo_sk))], joinType=[inner])\r\n+           LogicalJoin(condition=[=($117(cd_demo_sk), $88(c_current_cdemo_sk))], joinType=[inner])\r\n+             LogicalJoin(condition=[=($104(ca_address_sk), $90(c_current_addr_sk))], joinType=[inner])\r\n+               LogicalJoin(condition=[=($38(cr_returning_customer_sk), $86(c_customer_sk))], joinType=[inner])\r\n-                 LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n?                                          ^\n\n+                 LogicalJoin(condition=[=($31(cr_returned_date_sk), $58(d_date_sk))], joinType=[inner])\r\n?                                        +++++++++++ + ^ +++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n+                   LogicalJoin(condition=[=($42(cr_call_center_sk), $0(cc_call_center_sk))], joinType=[inner])\r\n-                   LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n-                     LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n-                       LogicalTableScan(table=[[call_center]])\r\n? --\n\n+                     LogicalTableScan(table=[[call_center]])\r\n-                       LogicalTableScan(table=[[catalog_returns]])\r\n? --\n\n+                     LogicalTableScan(table=[[catalog_returns]])\r\n+                   LogicalFilter(condition=[AND(=($6(d_year), 2000), =($8(d_moy), 3))])\r\n                      LogicalTableScan(table=[[date_dim]])\r\n-                   LogicalTableScan(table=[[customer]])\r\n? --\n\n+                 LogicalTableScan(table=[[customer]])\r\n+               LogicalFilter(condition=[=(CAST($11(ca_gmt_offset)):DECIMAL(12, 2), -7)])\r\n                  LogicalTableScan(table=[[customer_address]])\r\n+             LogicalFilter(condition=[OR(AND(=(CAST($2(cd_marital_status)):CHAR(1), 'M'), =(CAST($3(cd_education_status)):CHAR(7), 'Unknown')), AND(=(CAST($2(cd_marital_status)):CHAR(1), 'W'), =(CAST($3(cd_education_status)):CHAR(15), 'Advanced Degree')))])\r\n                LogicalTableScan(table=[[customer_demographics]])\r\n+           LogicalFilter(condition=[LIKE($2(hd_buy_potential), '501-1000%')])\r\n              LogicalTableScan(table=[[household_demographics]])\r\n  \n```"}], 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'stream': False, 'temperature': 0.1}}

The filter's expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there's a matching row in the non-preserving side's table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned.\n```\n\nLogical Plan Changes After Rewrite: ```\n  LogicalSort(sort0=[$3(cr_net_loss)], dir0=[DESC])\r\n    LogicalProject(call_center=[$0(cc_call_center_id)], call_center_name=[$1(cc_name)], manager=[$2(cc_manager)], returns_loss=[$5(cr_net_loss)])\r\n      LogicalAggregate(group=[{0, 1, 2, 3, 4}], returns_loss=[SUM($5)])\r\n        LogicalProject(call_center=[$1(cc_call_center_id)], call_center_name=[$6(cc_name)], manager=[$11(cc_manager)], cd_marital_status=[$119(cd_marital_status)], cd_education_status=[$120(cd_education_status)], cr_net_loss=[$57(cr_net_loss)])\r\n-         LogicalFilter(condition=[AND(=($42(cr_call_center_sk), $0(cc_call_center_sk)), =($31(cr_returned_date_sk), $58(d_date_sk)), =($38(cr_returning_customer_sk), $86(c_customer_sk)), =($117(cd_demo_sk), $88(c_current_cdemo_sk)), =($126(hd_demo_sk), $89(c_current_hdemo_sk)), =($104(ca_address_sk), $90(c_current_addr_sk)), =($64(d_year), 2000), =($66(d_moy), 3), OR(AND(=(CAST($119(cd_marital_status)):CHAR(1), 'M'), =(CAST($120(cd_education_status)):CHAR(7), 'Unknown')), AND(=(CAST($119(cd_marital_status)):CHAR(1), 'W'), =(CAST($120(cd_education_status)):CHAR(15), 'Advanced Degree'))), LIKE($128(hd_buy_potential), '501-1000%'), =(CAST($115(ca_gmt_offset)):DECIMAL(12, 2), -7))])\r\n-           LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n-             LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n-               LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n+         LogicalJoin(condition=[=($126(hd_demo_sk), $89(c_current_hdemo_sk))], joinType=[inner])\r\n+           LogicalJoin(condition=[=($117(cd_demo_sk), $88(c_current_cdemo_sk))], joinType=[inner])\r\n+             LogicalJoin(condition=[=($104(ca_address_sk), $90(c_current_addr_sk))], joinType=[inner])\r\n+               LogicalJoin(condition=[=($38(cr_returning_customer_sk), $86(c_customer_sk))], joinType=[inner])\r\n-                 LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n?                                          ^\n\n+                 LogicalJoin(condition=[=($31(cr_returned_date_sk), $58(d_date_sk))], joinType=[inner])\r\n?                                        +++++++++++ + ^ +++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n+                   LogicalJoin(condition=[=($42(cr_call_center_sk), $0(cc_call_center_sk))], joinType=[inner])\r\n-                   LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n-                     LogicalJoin(condition=[true], joinType=[inner])\r\n-                       LogicalTableScan(table=[[call_center]])\r\n? --\n\n+                     LogicalTableScan(table=[[call_center]])\r\n-                       LogicalTableScan(table=[[catalog_returns]])\r\n? --\n\n+                     LogicalTableScan(table=[[catalog_returns]])\r\n+                   LogicalFilter(condition=[AND(=($6(d_year), 2000), =($8(d_moy), 3))])\r\n                      LogicalTableScan(table=[[date_dim]])\r\n-                   LogicalTableScan(table=[[customer]])\r\n? --\n\n+                 LogicalTableScan(table=[[customer]])\r\n+               LogicalFilter(condition=[=(CAST($11(ca_gmt_offset)):DECIMAL(12, 2), -7)])\r\n                  LogicalTableScan(table=[[customer_address]])\r\n+             LogicalFilter(condition=[OR(AND(=(CAST($2(cd_marital_status)):CHAR(1), 'M'), =(CAST($3(cd_education_status)):CHAR(7), 'Unknown')), AND(=(CAST($2(cd_marital_status)):CHAR(1), 'W'), =(CAST($3(cd_education_status)):CHAR(15), 'Advanced Degree')))])\r\n                LogicalTableScan(table=[[customer_demographics]])\r\n+           LogicalFilter(condition=[LIKE($2(hd_buy_potential), '501-1000%')])\r\n              LogicalTableScan(table=[[household_demographics]])\r\n  \n```"}], 'response': 'Step 1: The logical plan changes indicate that several filter conditions originally applied after the joins in the `WHERE` clause have been moved into the `ON` clause of the respective `INNER JOIN` operations. Specifically, conditions that only involve columns from one side of the join have been pushed down to reduce the dataset size before the join occurs.\n\nStep 2: Parsing the logical plan changes, we observe the following detailed changes:\n- The condition `cr_call_center_sk = cc_call_center_sk` is now part of the `ON` clause of the join between `call_center` and `catalog_returns`.\n- The condition `cr_returned_date_sk = d_date_sk` is now part of the `ON` clause of the join between `catalog_returns` and `date_dim`.\n- The condition `cr_returning_customer_sk = c_customer_sk` is now part of the `ON` clause of the join between `catalog_returns` and `customer`.\n- The condition `cd_demo_sk = c_current_cdemo_sk` is now part of the `ON` clause of the join between `customer_demographics` and `customer`.\n- The condition `hd_demo_sk = c_current_hdemo_sk` is now part of the `ON` clause of the join between `household_demographics` and `customer`.\n- The condition `ca_address_sk = c_current_addr_sk` is now part of the `ON` clause of the join between `customer_address` and `customer`.\n- The filter conditions `d_year = 2000` and `d_moy = 3` are now applied directly to the `date_dim` table.\n- The filter condition `ca_gmt_offset = -7` is now applied directly to the `customer_address` table.\n- The filter condition on marital and education status is now applied directly to the `customer_demographics` table.\n- The filter condition on buy potential is now applied directly to the `household_demographics` table.\n\nStep 3: The SQL query rewrite rule contains multiple cases. The changes observed match Case 1, where filter conditions that can be logically associated with only one side of an `INNER JOIN` are moved into the `ON` clause of the join. This is evident as the conditions moved involve columns from only one of the tables involved in each join.\n\nStep 4: The query rewrite process involves optimizing the original SQL query by pushing down filter conditions that only involve columns from one side of an `INNER JOIN` into the `ON` clause of the join. This reduces the size of the datasets before the join occurs, potentially improving query performance. For example, the condition `cr_call_center_sk = cc_call_center_sk` is moved to the `ON` clause of the join between `call_center` and `catalog_returns`, and similar transformations are applied to other joins. Additionally, conditions that can be applied directly to individual tables, such as `d_year = 2000` and `d_moy = 3` for `date_dim`, are applied as filters on those tables before the join. This transformation aligns with Case 1 of the query rewrite rule, enhancing efficiency by reducing intermediate result sizes.', 'time': 5.9871439933776855}

The original plan had a `LogicalAggregate` operation that grouped by columns `{0, 1, 2, 3, 4}` and computed `SUM($5)`. This was followed by a `LogicalProject` operation that selected specific columns. In the rewritten plan, the `LogicalAggregate` now groups by `{1, 6, 11, 119, 120}` and computes `SUM($57)`, while the `LogicalProject` operation has been adjusted to reflect these changes. The `LogicalFilter` and `LogicalJoin` operations remain largely unchanged, indicating that the main transformation occurred in the aggregation and projection steps.\n\nStep 2: Parsing the logical plan changes, we see that the original SQL query's `GROUP BY` clause included `cc_call_center_id`, `cc_name`, `cc_manager`, `cd_marital_status`, and `cd_education_status`. The `SELECT` clause included these columns and the aggregate `SUM(cr_net_loss)`. The rewritten plan shows that the `GROUP BY` and `SUM` operations are applied directly to the data source, with the `LogicalProject` operation now reflecting the renamed columns: `call_center`, `call_center_name`, `manager`, and `returns_loss`.\n\nStep 3: The query rewrite rule contains two cases. Case 1 applies when the `GROUP BY` clause groups by simple columns, and the aggregate functions operate directly on columns without transformations. Case 2 applies when the `SELECT` clause of an outer query matches the columns used in the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions of an inner query. In this scenario, the changes match Case 1, as the `GROUP BY` clause in the original query groups by simple columns, and the aggregate function `SUM(cr_net_loss)` operates directly on a column. The `SELECT` clause only contains columns used in the `GROUP BY` and the aggregate function, without transformations.\n\nStep 4: The SQL query changes can be explained by Case 1 of the query rewrite rule. The original query's `GROUP BY` clause and aggregate function `SUM(cr_net_loss)` were directly applied to the data source in the rewritten plan. The `LogicalProject` operation was adjusted to reflect the renamed columns without any transformations. This optimization eliminates unnecessary projection layers, streamlining the query execution by applying aggregation directly to the data source.

Query 1: The query rewrite process involves optimizing the original SQL query by pushing down filter conditions that only involve columns from one side of an `INNER JOIN` into the `ON` clause of the join. This reduces the size of the datasets before the join occurs, potentially improving query performance. For example, the condition `cr_call_center_sk = cc_call_center_sk` is moved to the `ON` clause of the join between `call_center` and `catalog_returns`, and similar transformations are applied to other joins. Additionally, conditions that can be applied directly to individual tables, such as `d_year = 2000` and `d_moy = 3` for `date_dim`, are applied as filters on those tables before the join. This transformation aligns with Case 1 of the query rewrite rule, enhancing efficiency by reducing intermediate result sizes.
Query 2: The SQL query changes can be explained by Case 1 of the query rewrite rule. The original query's `GROUP BY` clause and aggregate function `SUM(cr_net_loss)` were directly applied to the data source in the rewritten plan. The `LogicalProject` operation was adjusted to reflect the renamed columns without any transformations. This optimization eliminates unnecessary projection layers, streamlining the query execution by applying aggregation directly to the data source.

Applying Rule 1's transformation `(x AND y) OR z` into `(x OR z) AND (y OR z)`, we can rewrite this as:
```sql
(cd_marital_status = 'M' OR cd_marital_status = 'W')
AND (cd_education_status = 'Unknown' OR cd_education_status = 'Advanced Degree')
```
This transformation simplifies the condition by distributing the `OR` across the `AND`, potentially improving the efficiency of the query execution.
Query 4: The query performs a `GROUP BY` operation after multiple `JOIN` operations. According to Rule 3, we can enhance performance by performing `GROUP BY` operations earlier. 

To apply this, we can create a subquery that performs the `GROUP BY` operation on the `call_center` and `catalog_returns` tables before joining with other tables. This reduces the size of the intermediate dataset:

```sql
SELECT 
    Call_Center,
    Call_Center_Name,
    Manager,
    Returns_Loss
FROM (
    SELECT  
        cc_call_center_id AS Call_Center,
        cc_name AS Call_Center_Name,
        cc_manager AS Manager,
        SUM(cr_net_loss) AS Returns_Loss,
        cr_call_center_sk,
        cr_returned_date_sk,
        cr_returning_customer_sk
    FROM
        call_center
    JOIN
        catalog_returns ON cr_call_center_sk = cc_call_center_sk
    GROUP BY 
        cc_call_center_id, cc_name, cc_manager, cr_call_center_sk, cr_returned_date_sk, cr_returning_customer_sk
) AS pre_aggregated
JOIN
    date_dim ON pre_aggregated.cr_returned_date_sk = d_date_sk
JOIN
    customer ON pre_aggregated.cr_returning_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
JOIN
    customer_demographics ON cd_demo_sk = c_current_cdemo_sk
JOIN
    household_demographics ON hd_demo_sk = c_current_hdemo_sk
JOIN
    customer_address ON ca_address_sk = c_current_addr_sk
WHERE
    d_year = 2000 
    AND d_moy = 3
    AND (cd_marital_status = 'M' OR cd_marital_status = 'W')
    AND (cd_education_status = 'Unknown' OR cd_education_status = 'Advanced Degree')
    AND hd_buy_potential LIKE '501-1000%'
    AND ca_gmt_offset = -7
ORDER BY 
    Returns_Loss DESC;
```
This restructuring prioritizes the `GROUP BY` operation, potentially reducing the workload on subsequent `JOIN` operations and improving query performance.

Query Rewrite 1:
"""The query rewrite process involves optimizing the original SQL query by pushing down filter conditions that only involve columns from one side of an `INNER JOIN` into the `ON` clause of the join. This reduces the size of the datasets before the join occurs, potentially improving query performance. For example, the condition `cr_call_center_sk = cc_call_center_sk` is moved to the `ON` clause of the join between `call_center` and `catalog_returns`, and similar transformations are applied to other joins. Additionally, conditions that can be applied directly to individual tables, such as `d_year = 2000` and `d_moy = 3` for `date_dim`, are applied as filters on those tables before the join. This transformation aligns with Case 1 of the query rewrite rule, enhancing efficiency by reducing intermediate result sizes."""

Query Rewrite 2:
"""The SQL query changes can be explained by Case 1 of the query rewrite rule. The original query's `GROUP BY` clause and aggregate function `SUM(cr_net_loss)` were directly applied to the data source in the rewritten plan. The `LogicalProject` operation was adjusted to reflect the renamed columns without any transformations. This optimization eliminates unnecessary projection layers, streamlining the query execution by applying aggregation directly to the data source. The `GROUP BY` clause and aggregate function remain unchanged in terms of logic, but their application is more efficient in the rewritten plan."""

Query Rewrite 3:
"""The original query contains a nested `AND`/`OR` condition in the `WHERE` clause:
```sql
( (cd_marital_status = 'M' and cd_education_status = 'Unknown')
or (cd_marital_status = 'W' and cd_education_status = 'Advanced Degree'))
```
Applying Rule 1's transformation `(x AND y) OR z` into `(x OR z) AND (y OR z)`, we can rewrite this as:
```sql
(cd_marital_status = 'M' OR cd_marital_status = 'W')
AND (cd_education_status = 'Unknown' OR cd_education_status = 'Advanced Degree')
```
This transformation simplifies the condition by distributing the `OR` across the `AND`, potentially improving the efficiency of the query execution."""

Query Rewrite 4:
"""The query performs a `GROUP BY` operation after multiple `JOIN` operations. According to Rule 3, we can enhance performance by performing `GROUP BY` operations earlier. 

To apply this, we can create a subquery that performs the `GROUP BY` operation on the `call_center` and `catalog_returns` tables before joining with other tables. This reduces the size of the intermediate dataset:

```sql
SELECT 
    Call_Center,
    Call_Center_Name,
    Manager,
    Returns_Loss
FROM (
    SELECT  
        cc_call_center_id AS Call_Center,
        cc_name AS Call_Center_Name,
        cc_manager AS Manager,
        SUM(cr_net_loss) AS Returns_Loss,
        cr_call_center_sk,
        cr_returned_date_sk,
        cr_returning_customer_sk
    FROM
        call_center
    JOIN
        catalog_returns ON cr_call_center_sk = cc_call_center_sk
    GROUP BY 
        cc_call_center_id, cc_name, cc_manager, cr_call_center_sk, cr_returned_date_sk, cr_returning_customer_sk
) AS pre_aggregated
JOIN
    date_dim ON pre_aggregated.cr_returned_date_sk = d_date_sk
JOIN
    customer ON pre_aggregated.cr_returning_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
JOIN
    customer_demographics ON cd_demo_sk = c_current_cdemo_sk
JOIN
    household_demographics ON hd_demo_sk = c_current_hdemo_sk
JOIN
    customer_address ON ca_address_sk = c_current_addr_sk
WHERE
    d_year = 2000 
    AND d_moy = 3
    AND (cd_marital_status = 'M' OR cd_marital_status = 'W')

    AND hd_buy_potential LIKE '501-1000%'

Here's a breakdown of the strategies:\n\n1. **Query Rewrite 1**: Focuses on pushing down filter conditions into the `ON` clause of joins and applying filters directly to individual tables before the join. This is a classic optimization technique to reduce the size of datasets before joining.\n\n2. **Query Rewrite 2**: Emphasizes applying aggregation directly to the data source and eliminating unnecessary projection layers. This is about optimizing the execution plan by streamlining operations.\n\n3. **Query Rewrite 3**: Involves transforming complex `AND`/`OR` conditions in the `WHERE` clause to potentially simplify and improve execution efficiency. This is a logical transformation of conditions.\n\n4. **Query Rewrite 4**: Suggests performing `GROUP BY` operations earlier in the query execution process, specifically before joining with other tables, to reduce intermediate dataset sizes. This is about restructuring the query to optimize the order of operations.\n\nBased on these observations, we can cluster the strategies as follows:\n\n- **Cluster 1: Join and Filter Optimization**: Strategies that focus on optimizing joins and filters.\n  - Query Rewrite 1\n\n- **Cluster 2: Aggregation and Projection Optimization**: Strategies that focus on optimizing aggregation and projection operations.\n  - Query Rewrite 2\n  - Query Rewrite 4\n\n- **Cluster 3: Logical Condition Transformation**: Strategies that focus on transforming logical conditions for potential efficiency gains.\n  - Query Rewrite 3\n\nHere is the clustering in Python list format:\n\n```python\n[\n    [0],  # Query Rewrite 1\n    [1, 3],  # Query Rewrite 2 and Query Rewrite 4\n    [2]  # Query Rewrite 3\n]\n```", 'time': 3.9390978813171387}

1. **Query Rewrite 1** focuses on pushing down filter conditions into the `ON` clause of joins and applying filters directly to individual tables before the join. This is a join optimization strategy.

2. **Query Rewrite 2** emphasizes applying aggregation directly to the data source and eliminating unnecessary projection layers. This is an optimization related to aggregation and projection.

3. **Query Rewrite 3** deals with transforming nested `AND`/`OR` conditions in the `WHERE` clause to simplify the condition. This is a logical condition simplification strategy.

4. **Query Rewrite 4** suggests performing `GROUP BY` operations earlier in the query execution plan to reduce the size of intermediate datasets. This is an optimization related to the order of operations, specifically focusing on aggregation before joins.

The filter's expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side.

Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there\'s a matching row in the non-preserving side\'s table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned."""\n\n### Rule AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: - The SQL query contains a `GROUP BY` clause that groups by simple columns (no expressions in the `GROUP BY` list).\n- The aggregate functions in the `SELECT` clause operate directly on columns (no expressions inside the aggregate functions).\n- The `SELECT` clause only contains the columns used in the `GROUP BY` clause and the aggregates without any transformations or additional expressions.\n**Transformations**: - Directly apply the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions to the data source referred to in the `FROM` clause of the inner query before the projection.\n- Eliminate the outer projection layer if it only renames the columns without transforming them.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: - The `SELECT` clause of an outer query precisely matches the columns used in the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions of an inner query, without any column transformations or renamings.\n- The inner `SELECT` only serves as a passthrough for these columns.\n**Transformations**: - Remove the inner `SELECT` layer, directly applying the aggregate functions and `GROUP BY` to the original data source."""\n\n### Rule SORT_PROJECT_TRANSPOSE:\n"""**Conditions**: If a SQL query executes a sort operation on columns that are directly referenced in the SELECT list or through expressions that are strictly monotonic transformations of these columns, and the sort operation directly follows these projections (SELECT statements), the sort operation can be pushed to operate directly on the table (FROM clause) before the projection.\n**Transformations**: 1. Check Compatibility: Ensure both sort and project (SELECT and ORDER BY clauses) involve compatible operations that relate directly to the raw column data or involve monotonic transformations.\n2. Analyze Order By Fields: Verify that each column in the ORDER BY clause is directly represented in the SELECT list or is a derived column through a monotonic transformation (e.g., casting integers to floats where the order is preserved).\n3. Adjust SQL Query: Rewrite the query so that sorting (ORDER BY clause) is applied to the raw table data in the FROM clause rather than after the projection. This might involve introducing a subquery or CTE (Common Table Expression) where the sorting is applied first, followed by the projections.\n4. Optimize Projection: Ensure that the SELECT list in the outer query matches the original projection, applying on top of the sorted data now."""\n\n### Rule PROJECT_FILTER_TRANSPOSE:\n"""**Conditions**: This rewrite rule can be applied when an SQL query contains a SELECT operation (acting as the `Project` operation) followed by a WHERE clause (acting as the `Filter` operation), provided that the SELECT does not contain window functions (such as RANK(), ROW_NUMBER(), etc.) and the columns selected do not affect the outcome of the WHERE clause.\n**Transformations**: To apply the rule, refactor the SQL query so that the conditions in the WHERE clause are evaluated before the columns are selected in the SELECT clause. This may involve moving computations or column transformations from the SELECT clause to a sub-query that the WHERE clause is applied on, ensuring the final SELECT clause on the outermost query matches the original query\'s expected outcome. - Before: SELECT col1, transformation_function(col2) FROM table WHERE condition; - After: SELECT col1, transformation_function(col2) FROM (SELECT col1, col2 FROM table WHERE condition) AS subquery;"""\n\n### Rule AGGREGATE_REDUCE_FUNCTIONS:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: any SELECT statement or subquery using the AVG aggregate function\n**Transformations**: AVG(x) as SUM(x) / COUNT(x)\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: computing the population standard deviation\n**Transformations**: STDDEV_POP(x) as the square root of (`SUM(x^2) - SUM(x)^2 / COUNT(x)`) / COUNT(x)\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: for the sample standard deviation computation\n**Transformations**: STDDEV_SAMP(x) as the square root of (`SUM(x^2) - SUM(x)^2 / COUNT(x)`) / (COUNT(x) - 1)\nCase 4:\n**Conditions**: for the population variance computation\n**Transformations**: VAR_POP(x) as (`SUM(x^2) - SUM(x)^2 / COUNT(x)`) / COUNT(x)\nCase 5:\n**Conditions**: for the sample variance computation\n**Transformations**: VAR_SAMP(x) as (`SUM(x^2) - SUM(x)^2 / COUNT(x)`) / (COUNT(x) - 1)\nCase 6:\n**Conditions**: to compute population covariance\n**Transformations**: COVAR_POP(x, y) by applying a formula involving SUM and COUNT\nCase 7:\n**Conditions**: using a formula for sample covariance\n**Transformations**: COVAR_SAMP(x, y) using a formula involving SUM, COUNT, and an adjustment for sample calculations\nCase 8:\n**Conditions**: for transforming REGR_SXX(x, y) and REGR_SYY(x, y)\n**Transformations**: into expressions involving the computation of VAR_POP(x) or VAR_POP(y) respectively, multiplied by REGR_COUNT(x, y)"""\n\n### Rule JOIN_TO_CORRELATE:\n"""**Conditions**: The join type is either INNER JOIN or LEFT JOIN. There are no requirements in the query that would inherently create NULL values on the left side when there are no matching rows on the right side (for INNER JOIN, this condition is naturally met; for LEFT JOIN, it is met if every row on the left side has at least one corresponding row on the right side according to the join condition).\n**Transformations**: 1. Identify the INNER JOIN or LEFT JOIN condition in the SQL query. 2. Extract the ON clause representing the join condition. 3. For INNER JOIN: - Replace the INNER JOIN with a WHERE EXISTS clause, moving the original join condition into the WHERE clause of a subquery that selects from the right side table. Reference the left side columns as correlation variables in the subquery\'s WHERE clause. - Example Transformation: SELECT * FROM left_table INNER JOIN right_table ON left_table.id = right_table.foreign_id Becomes: SELECT * FROM left_table WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM right_table WHERE left_table.id = right_table.foreign_id) 4. For LEFT JOIN: - Replace the LEFT JOIN with a LEFT OUTER JOIN subquery that is correlated to the outer query. In the SELECT clause of the outer query, include a CASE statement or similar logic to handle selection from the subquery result. - Example Transformation: SELECT left_table.*, right_table.* FROM left_table LEFT JOIN right_table ON left_table.id = right_table.foreign_id Becomes: SELECT left_table.*, COALESCE(subquery.alias1, \'default\') FROM left_table LEFT OUTER JOIN (SELECT foreign_id, column1 AS alias1 FROM right_table) subquery ON left_table.id = subquery.foreign_id"""'}], 'response': 'Step 1: Evaluate each suggestion against the provided query rewrite rules.\n\n### Suggestion 1:\n1. **Pushing down filter conditions into the `ON` clause of `INNER JOIN` operations**:\n   - **Rule FILTER_INTO_JOIN**: This rule can be applied to move filter conditions from the `WHERE` clause to the `ON` clause of an `INNER JOIN`.

The second strategy streamlines the query execution by applying the `GROUP BY` clause and aggregate function directly to the data source, eliminating unnecessary projection layers. The third strategy simplifies complex `AND`/`OR` conditions in the `WHERE` clause by distributing the `OR` across the `AND`, potentially improving execution efficiency.

The first strategy involves pushing down filter conditions into the `ON` clause of `INNER JOIN` operations, which reduces dataset sizes before joining, and applying filters directly to individual tables, such as `date_dim`, to minimize intermediate results. The second strategy streamlines the query execution by applying the `GROUP BY` clause and aggregate function directly to the data source, eliminating unnecessary projection layers. The third strategy simplifies complex `AND`/`OR` conditions in the `WHERE` clause by distributing the `OR` across the `AND`, potentially improving execution efficiency. The fourth strategy suggests performing `GROUP BY` operations earlier by creating a subquery that aggregates data from `call_center` and `catalog_returns` before joining with other tables, thus reducing the size of intermediate datasets and the workload on subsequent joins. Together, these strategies aim to optimize query execution by reducing data processing overhead and improving the efficiency of operations."""\n\nQuery Rewrite Rules:\n### Rule FILTER_INTO_JOIN:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: This SQL query rewrite rule applies when a filter condition is placed on the result set of an INNER JOIN operation. The filter\'s expressions do not reference columns from both tables involved in the join but can be logically applied to either input of the join to reduce the size of datasets before the join occurs.\n**Transformations**: If a SQL query contains an INNER JOIN with a WHERE clause that can be logically associated only with columns from one side of the join (either left or right), move these conditions into the ON clause of the INNER JOIN or as a WHERE clause on a subquery of the respective side. Transform `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(A)` into `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(A)` if `condition2` only involves columns from A.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: This rule is applicable when a filter condition applies to the result set of a LEFT or RIGHT OUTER JOIN and the filter applies solely to columns from the non-preserving side of the join. This requires careful consideration as pushing a filter into a WHERE clause of a subquery representing the non-preserving side could change the semantics of the query by inadvertently converting the OUTER JOIN into an INNER JOIN.\n**Transformations**: For a LEFT OUTER JOIN where a subsequent WHERE clause filters columns from the right table, convert this filter into an AND condition within the ON clause of the JOIN, if it does not alter the expected result set. For instance, transform `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE condition2(B)` to `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 AND condition2(B)` cautiously, ensuring that `condition2(B)` does not lead to excluding rows from A which have no corresponding rows in B, effectively preserving the LEFT JOIN semantics.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: This applies when a subsequent WHERE clause filter mandates the presence of non-NULL values in columns from the non-preserving side of an OUTER JOIN. This specific filtering effectively mandates that there\'s a matching row in the non-preserving side\'s table, thus allowing the OUTER JOIN to be converted to an INNER JOIN for efficiency.\n**Transformations**: Convert OUTER JOINS to INNER JOINS when followed by WHERE clauses that eliminate the possibility of NULL results from the non-preserving side. For example, `SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON condition1 WHERE B.column IS NOT NULL` can be efficiently rewritten as `SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON condition1` because the WHERE clause enforces a logic that requires a match in B for every row returned."""\n\n### Rule AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: - The SQL query contains a `GROUP BY` clause that groups by simple columns (no expressions in the `GROUP BY` list).\n- The aggregate functions in the `SELECT` clause operate directly on columns (no expressions inside the aggregate functions).\n- The `SELECT` clause only contains the columns used in the `GROUP BY` clause and the aggregates without any transformations or additional expressions.\n**Transformations**: - Directly apply the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions to the data source referred to in the `FROM` clause of the inner query before the projection.\n- Eliminate the outer projection layer if it only renames the columns without transforming them.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: - The `SELECT` clause of an outer query precisely matches the columns used in the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions of an inner query, without any column transformations or renamings.\n- The inner `SELECT` only serves as a passthrough for these columns.\n**Transformations**: - Remove the inner `SELECT` layer, directly applying the aggregate functions and `GROUP BY` to the original data source."""\n\n### Rule PROJECT_FILTER_TRANSPOSE:\n"""**Conditions**: This rewrite rule can be applied when an SQL query contains a SELECT operation (acting as the `Project` operation) followed by a WHERE clause (acting as the `Filter` operation), provided that the SELECT does not contain window functions (such as RANK(), ROW_NUMBER(), etc.) and the columns selected do not affect the outcome of the WHERE clause.\n**Transformations**: To apply the rule, refactor the SQL query so that the conditions in the WHERE clause are evaluated before the columns are selected in the SELECT clause. This may involve moving computations or column transformations from the SELECT clause to a sub-query that the WHERE clause is applied on, ensuring the final SELECT clause on the outermost query matches the original query\'s expected outcome. - Before: SELECT col1, transformation_function(col2) FROM table WHERE condition; - After: SELECT col1, transformation_function(col2) FROM (SELECT col1, col2 FROM table WHERE condition) AS subquery;"""\n\nArranged Rule Sequence: ["FILTER_INTO_JOIN", "AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE", "PROJECT_FILTER_TRANSPOSE"]\n\nUtilized Rules: ["FILTER_INTO_JOIN", "AGGREGATE_PROJECT_MERGE"]\n\nUnutilized Rules: ["PROJECT_FILTER_TRANSPOSE"]'}], 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'stream': False, 'temperature': 0.1}}
