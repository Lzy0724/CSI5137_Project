This condition was removed, and the query was transformed to select no rows, as indicated by the `LogicalValues(tuples=[[]])`.

The subquery itself calculated `w_count` using a window function. The outer query also applied a filter `where w_count is null`. After the rewrite, the filter condition `IS NULL($2)` is directly applied to the subquery's result, and the outer `LogicalProject` is removed.\n\nStep 3: The query rewrite rule contains two cases. Case 1 involves removing an outer query when it merely selects the same columns as the subquery without transformations. Case 2 involves combining queries when the outer query only renames columns. In this scenario, the outer query does not rename columns or apply transformations; it simply selects columns and applies a filter. Therefore, Case 1 is matched, as the outer query is unnecessary for scoping and does not transform the data.\n\nStep 4: The SQL query changes can be explained by Case 1 of the query rewrite rule. The outer query in the original SQL merely selected the columns `empno`, `deptno`, and `w_count` from the subquery without any transformations or renaming. The subquery already provided these columns, and the outer query's filter condition `where w_count is null` could be directly applied to the subquery's result. Thus, the rewrite rule removed the outer query, simplifying the logical plan by directly applying the filter to the subquery's output. This optimization reduces unnecessary query layers and improves execution efficiency.", 'time': 6.649592399597168}

Query 1: In Case 2 of the query rewrite rule, the `WHERE` clause condition `w_count is null` is identified as a condition that always results in no rows being selected. The transformation involves replacing the query with one that selects no rows. This is exactly what happened in the logical plan changes, where the `LogicalFilter` and `LogicalTableScan` were removed, and a `LogicalValues(tuples=[[]])` was added to represent an empty result set. Thus, the query rewrite process effectively recognized that the condition `w_count is null` would never be satisfied, and optimized the query to immediately return an empty result set.

You will also be provided with an arranged sequence of those rules, the actually utilized rules, and the unutilized rules in that arrangement. Your task is to propose another rule arrangement to optimize the given SQL query more effectively. Follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: For each unutilized rules in the provided arrangement, you should examine whether they match the provided query rewrite suggestions. If so, you should prioritize such unutilized potential rules over the utilized rules.\n\nStep 2: Determine the overall sequence for all the rules, so that the new arrangement can better match the provided query rewrite suggestions.\n\nOutput in the following format:\nStep 1: <step 1 reasoning>\nStep 2: <step 2 reasoning>\n, then a python list of re-arranged rule names encapsulated with ```python and ```, formatted as:\n```python\n["rule_name_1", "rule_name_2", ...]\n```\n, where the sequence of the list corresponds to the re-arranged order of all the provided rules.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': '\nSQL Query:\n```sql\nselect empno, deptno, w_count from (\n  select empno, deptno, count(empno) over (w) w_count\n  from emp\n  window w as (partition by deptno order by empno)\n) sub_query where w_count is null;\n```\n\nQuery Rewrite Suggestions:\n### Suggestion 1:\n"""The provided SQL query is optimized using two main rewrite strategies. The first strategy identifies that the `WHERE` clause condition `w_count is null` will never be satisfied, as the `w_count` column, derived from a window function, cannot be null. Consequently, the query is transformed to immediately return an empty result set by removing unnecessary components like `LogicalFilter` and `LogicalTableScan`, and introducing `LogicalValues(tuples=[[]])` to represent no rows. The second strategy simplifies the query by eliminating the outer query layer, as it merely selects columns without any additional transformations. By directly applying the `where w_count is null` condition to the subquery\'s output, the rewrite reduces complexity and enhances execution efficiency by removing redundant query layers. Together, these strategies streamline the query to avoid unnecessary computations and directly yield an empty result set."""\n\nQuery Rewrite Rules:\n### Rule FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains conditions that can be statically determined as always true (e.g., constant expressions like `1=1` or tautologies based on the column data types and constraints), then these conditions don\'t affect the result set.\n**Transformations**: Remove such conditions from the WHERE clause. If this results in an empty WHERE clause, remove the WHERE clause entirely.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause simplifies to conditions that are always false or involve comparisons with NULL in a way that the outcome is always false or NULL (e.g., `column != column` or `1=0`), indicating no rows can satisfy the filter.\n**Transformations**: Replace the query with one that selects no rows. This could be represented in different ways based on the SQL dialect. One universal method might be selecting from a dual table with a false condition.\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: If the WHERE clause of a SELECT query contains complex conditions that can be simplified based on known constraints, constants, or through logical simplification (e.g., `column IS NOT NULL AND column IS NOT NULL` simplifies to `column IS NOT NULL`).\n**Transformations**: Simplify the conditions according to logical rules and known constraints. Remove redundancy and unnecessary complexity."""\n\n### Rule PROJECT_REMOVE:\n"""Case 1:\n**Conditions**: You have a SQL query with a subquery or derived table where the outer query merely selects the same columns as produced by the subquery without applying any transformations, functions, or renaming and where the subquery does not require the outer query for scoping column names.\n**Transformations**: Remove the outer query (or derived table) and use the subquery directly.\nCase 2:\n**Conditions**: You have a SQL query with an outer query that selects columns from a subquery or derived table involving only trivial operations like renaming of columns without modifying their values.\n**Transformations**: Combine the outer query and the subquery (or derived table) into a single query by adopting the column names specified in the outer query. If the outer query renames columns, apply these renamings directly in the subquery or derived table."""\n\nArranged Rule Sequence: ["FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS", "PROJECT_REMOVE"]\n\nUtilized Rules: ["FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS", "PROJECT_REMOVE"]\n\nUnutilized Rules: []'}], 'response': 'Step 1: In the provided arrangement, both rules "FILTER_REDUCE_EXPRESSIONS" and "PROJECT_REMOVE" were utilized, and there are no unutilized rules.
