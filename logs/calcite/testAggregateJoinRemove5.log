The `LogicalProject` layer, which was projecting `deptno` and `name`, has been removed. This suggests that the aggregation is now directly applied to the result of the join operation.\n\nStep 2: Parsing the logical plan changes, we see that the original SQL query had a `GROUP BY` clause on `d.deptno` and an aggregate function `count(distinct d.name)`. The `LogicalProject` that was projecting `deptno` and `name` has been eliminated, and the `LogicalAggregate` now directly applies to the `LogicalJoin`. The join condition and the tables involved (`emp` and `dept`) remain unchanged.\n\nStep 3: The query rewrite rule contains two cases. Case 1 involves simplifying queries where the `GROUP BY` and aggregates are directly applied to the data source without additional transformations. Case 2 involves removing an inner `SELECT` layer when it only serves as a passthrough. The changes in the logical plan match Case 1, as the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions are directly applied to the result of the join without any intermediate projection or transformation.\n\nStep 4: In the original SQL query, the `GROUP BY` clause grouped by `d.deptno`, and the `SELECT` clause included `d.deptno` and `count(distinct d.name)`. The query rewrite rule applied Case 1, which allows the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions to be directly applied to the data source referred to in the `FROM` clause.

This matches the condition of Rule 2, which applies to queries with `GROUP BY` and `JOIN` operations. However, the rule is more focused on performance improvements for large datasets or EAV tables, which is not explicitly mentioned in the query. Nonetheless, the basic condition of having a `GROUP BY` with a `JOIN` is met.\n- **Rule 3**: The query uses `DISTINCT` within an aggregate function `count(distinct d.name)`.

Query 1: In the original SQL query, the `GROUP BY` clause grouped by `d.deptno`, and the `SELECT` clause included `d.deptno` and `count(distinct d.name)`. The query rewrite rule applied Case 1, which allows the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions to be directly applied to the data source referred to in the `FROM` clause. The `LogicalProject` layer, which was only projecting the columns used in the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions, was removed. This optimization simplifies the query execution by eliminating unnecessary projection steps, directly applying the aggregation to the result of the join operation.
Query 2: The original query uses a `RIGHT JOIN` between `emp e` and `dept d` with the condition `e.deptno = d.deptno`. According to Rule 1, we can transform this `RIGHT JOIN` into a `LEFT JOIN` by swapping the order of the tables. The transformed query will have `dept d` as the left table and `emp e` as the right table, resulting in a `LEFT JOIN`. The transformed query is:

```sql
select d.deptno, count(distinct d.name)
from dept d
left outer join emp e on d.deptno = e.deptno
group by d.deptno;
```

This transformation simplifies the processing by using a `LEFT JOIN`, which is often more optimized and understood by SQL engines.
Query 3: The query performs a `GROUP BY` operation on `d.deptno` after a `JOIN`. According to Rule 2, we can enhance performance by performing the `GROUP BY` operation earlier in the query execution.

02:41:30,386 root WARNING Failed to cluster rewrite strategies: To cluster the provided query rewrite strategies, we need to analyze the focus and nature of each strategy:

1. **Query Rewrite 1** focuses on optimizing the query execution by removing unnecessary projection steps, specifically targeting the `LogicalProject` layer and simplifying the aggregation process.

2. **Query Rewrite 2** involves changing the join type from `RIGHT JOIN` to `LEFT JOIN` by swapping the order of the tables, which is a structural transformation aimed at optimizing join operations.

3. **Query Rewrite 3** discusses the potential for reordering operations to enhance performance by performing `GROUP BY` earlier, but ultimately acknowledges that the current structure is already efficient. This strategy is more about recognizing optimization principles rather than applying a specific transformation.

Based on this analysis, we can cluster the strategies as follows:

- **Cluster 1**: Strategies focusing on projection and aggregation optimization.
  - Query Rewrite 1

- **Cluster 2**: Strategies focusing on join type and order optimization.
  - Query Rewrite 2

- **Cluster 3**: Strategies focusing on theoretical optimization principles without specific transformations.

Generate an intermediate SQL query (bottom Aggregate) that groups by both the distinct column(s) and any columns involved in the GROUP BY clause, calculating all distinct aggregates at this stage. 2. Apply a second SQL query (top Aggregate) on top of the intermediate result to compute non-distinct aggregates. 3. If the original query contains operations that logically precede the aggregation (e.g., joins with other tables), incorporate these as necessary before the bottom Aggregate, possibly leading to a join operation. 4. Use a SELECT statement (final Project) to realign the output columns if necessary to match the original query\'s expected output.\n**Transformations**: Generate an intermediate SQL query that groups by the distinct and group by columns for distinct aggregates then apply another aggregation on this result for non-distinct aggregates. Join operational tables as necessary before aggregation\nCase 3:\n**Conditions**: For SQL queries involving multiple distinct aggregate functions over different columns (e.g., COUNT(DISTINCT column_a), COUNT(DISTINCT column_b)), the transformation should proceed as follows: 1. Decompose the query into multiple parts, each part handling one of the distinct aggregates. Each part will effectively be an intermediate SQL query that performs a GROUP BY on the distinct column related to its aggregate. 2. Use JOIN operations to combine these intermediate aggregate results based on the common grouping columns that are part of the original GROUP BY clause, if present. 3. Rewrite the initial distinct aggregates in the final SELECT statement to reference the appropriate aggregated results from the combined dataset without using the DISTINCT keyword. 4. Include a final SELECT statement (Project) to ensure that the output columns are correctly named and typed to match the expected result set of the original query.\n**Transformations**: Decompose the query into parts for each distinct aggregate and GROUP BY the related distinct column.
