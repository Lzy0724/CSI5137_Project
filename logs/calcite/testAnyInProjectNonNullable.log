The transformation involves replacing the sub-query with a join and additional logical operations to replicate the `ANY` semantics.\n\nStep 2: Parsing the logical plan changes, we see that the original sub-query `> ANY (select deptno from emp)` has been replaced by a combination of `LogicalJoin` and `LogicalAggregate` operations. The `LogicalAggregate` computes the `MIN` and `COUNT` of `deptno` from the `emp` table, and these results are used in the `LogicalProject` to evaluate the condition using logical expressions like `IS TRUE`, `<>`, and `<=`. The `LogicalJoin` is an inner join between the `dept` table and the aggregated results from the `emp` table.\n\nStep 3: The SQL query rewrite rule contains multiple cases.
