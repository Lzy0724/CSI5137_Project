Initially, the aggregates were applied to column `$0`, but after the rewrite, they are applied to column `$7`. Additionally, the `LogicalProject` layer that projected `deptno` was removed, and the `LogicalTableScan` now directly scans the `emp` table.\n\nStep 2: Parsing the logical plan changes, we see that the SQL query originally applied aggregate functions `SUM(DISTINCT deptno)`, `COUNT(DISTINCT deptno)`, and `BIT_OR(deptno)` directly on the `deptno` column.

Case 1 involves a `GROUP BY` clause, which is not present in the original SQL query. Case 2 involves removing an inner `SELECT` layer when the outer `SELECT` clause matches the columns used in the `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions of an inner query. Since the original query does not have an explicit inner query or `GROUP BY`, neither case directly applies. However, the transformation aligns more closely with Case 2, where the rewrite simplifies the query by removing unnecessary projections.\n\nStep 4: The SQL query changes can be explained by the simplification of the logical plan.

Replace inline functions in the SELECT or WHERE clause with a pre-calculated column if the function is deterministic and the input data does not change frequently.

When using aggregate functions that are called multiple times with the same parameters, consider storing the result in a variable or a temporary table, especially if the data set is large.\n\n4. Avoid using functions on indexed columns in the WHERE clause. This prevents the database from using the index efficiently. If a function must be used, consider creating a computed column that pre-calculates the function\'s result and index that column instead.\n\n5.

- The SQL query is:
  ```sql
  select sum(distinct deptno), count(distinct deptno), bit_or(deptno) from emp;
  ```

- **Rule 1 Conditions**: This rule applies when `DISTINCT` is used, especially with multiple columns and `ORDER BY`. The query uses `DISTINCT` but not with multiple columns or `ORDER BY`. However, it does use `DISTINCT` on the `deptno` column. The rule also mentions the relevance of indexes, but the query does not specify any indexes. Therefore, Rule 1 partially matches because `DISTINCT` is used, but not fully as there are no multiple columns or `ORDER BY`.

- **Rule 2 Conditions**: This rule applies when there are functions or operations executed multiple times for the same row, or computationally expensive operations. The query uses aggregate functions (`sum`, `count`, `bit_or`) but does not have repeated function calls or computationally expensive operations that are executed multiple times for the same row. Therefore, Rule 2 does not match the query.

Step 2: Apply the transformations of the matched rule(s).

Query Rewrite 1:
```sql
select deptno, sum(deptno), count(deptno), bit_or(deptno) from emp group by deptno;
```
Explanation:
- **Rule 1 Transformation**: The transformation suggests replacing `DISTINCT` with a `GROUP BY` clause on the same columns used in the `DISTINCT` operation. In this case, `deptno` is the column used with `DISTINCT`. By grouping by `deptno`, we can achieve the same effect as using `DISTINCT` while potentially improving execution efficiency, especially if there are indexes on `deptno`. The transformation involves rewriting the query to:
  ```sql
  select deptno, sum(deptno), count(deptno), bit_or(deptno) from emp group by deptno;
  ```
  This query groups the results by `deptno`, effectively removing duplicates for the purposes of aggregation, similar to the original use of `DISTINCT`.
```

No other rules apply, as Rule 2 does not match the query.

Generate an intermediate SQL query (bottom Aggregate) that groups by both the distinct column(s) and any columns involved in the GROUP BY clause, calculating all distinct aggregates at this stage. 2. Apply a second SQL query (top Aggregate) on top of the intermediate result to compute non-distinct aggregates. 3. If the original query contains operations that logically precede the aggregation (e.g., joins with other tables), incorporate these as necessary before the bottom Aggregate, possibly leading to a join operation. 4. Use a SELECT statement (final Project) to realign the output columns if necessary to match the original query's expected output.\n**Transformations**: Generate an intermediate SQL query that groups by the distinct and group by columns for distinct aggregates then apply another aggregation on this result for non-distinct aggregates.

Decompose the query into multiple parts, each part handling one of the distinct aggregates. Each part will effectively be an intermediate SQL query that performs a GROUP BY on the distinct column related to its aggregate. 2. Use JOIN operations to combine these intermediate aggregate results based on the common grouping columns that are part of the original GROUP BY clause, if present. 3. Rewrite the initial distinct aggregates in the final SELECT statement to reference the appropriate aggregated results from the combined dataset without using the DISTINCT keyword. 4. Include a final SELECT statement (Project) to ensure that the output columns are correctly named and typed to match the expected result set of the original query.\n**Transformations**: Decompose the query into parts for each distinct aggregate and GROUP BY the related distinct column.
