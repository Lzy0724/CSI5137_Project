The `LogicalFilter` and `LogicalAggregate` operations related to the `EXISTS` sub-query are no longer present in the rewritten plan. Instead, there is a direct `LogicalTableScan` on the `dept` table without any filtering condition.\n\nStep 2: Parsing the logical plan changes, the original SQL query contained an `EXISTS` sub-query that checked for the existence of rows in the `emp` table where `d.deptno = e.deptno`. This sub-query was removed, and the rewritten query now directly scans the `dept` table without any filtering condition. The `EXISTS` clause was effectively eliminated, suggesting that the rewrite rule transformed the query to remove the need for the sub-query.\n\nStep 3: The query rewrite rule contains multiple cases. Given the parsed SQL query changes, the relevant case is Case 2, specifically the transformation for `EXISTS` sub-queries. The original query used an `EXISTS` sub-query correlated with the outer query, which matches the conditions of Case 2. The transformation described in Case 2 involves converting the `EXISTS` condition into a JOIN operation, but in this specific instance, the transformation resulted in the removal of the sub-query altogether, likely due to the nature of the `EXISTS` check being redundant or always true.\n\nStep 4: The SQL query changes can be explained by the matched case from the query rewrite rule. The original query's `EXISTS` sub-query was intended to filter rows from the `dept` table based on the existence of matching rows in the `emp` table. However, the rewrite rule identified that the `EXISTS` condition could be simplified or was unnecessary, leading to its removal. The rewritten query now performs a simple scan of the `dept` table without any filtering, indicating that the `EXISTS` condition was either always true or redundant, thus optimizing the query by eliminating unnecessary operations. This aligns with the transformation approach in Case 2 for `EXISTS` sub-queries, where the goal is to simplify or eliminate the sub-query when possible.", 'time': 5.156987428665161}

Initially, there was a `LogicalProject` and `LogicalFilter` applied to a `LogicalTableScan` on the `dept` table. After the rewrite, the `LogicalProject` has been removed, and the `LogicalFilter` directly applies to the `LogicalTableScan` on the `dept` table. The subquery structure remains largely unchanged, but the outer query structure has been simplified.\n\nStep 2: Parsing the logical plan changes, we see that the original SQL query involved a `SELECT *` from the `dept` table with a `WHERE EXISTS` clause that contained a subquery. The subquery was counting rows in the `emp` table where `deptno` matched. The rewrite removed the outer `SELECT *` and directly applied the `EXISTS` condition to the `dept` table scan. The subquery remains intact, focusing on the `emp` table and the `deptno` correlation.\n\nStep 3: The query rewrite rule contains two cases. Case 1 involves removing an outer query when it merely selects the same columns as the subquery without transformations. Case 2 involves combining queries when the outer query only renames columns. In this scenario, the rewrite matches Case 1 because the outer query (`SELECT * FROM dept`) does not apply any transformations or renaming; it simply selects all columns from `dept`, and the subquery does not rely on the outer query for scoping.\n\nStep 4: The SQL query changes can be explained by Case 1 of the query rewrite rule. The original query's outer `SELECT *` from `dept` was removed because it did not apply any transformations or renaming to the columns. The `EXISTS` condition, which was the core of the filtering logic, was directly applied to the `dept` table scan. This simplification is possible because the subquery's logic (counting rows in `emp` where `deptno` matches) is independent of any transformations or renaming in the outer query.

This aligns with the transformation approach in Case 2 for `EXISTS` sub-queries, where the goal is to simplify or eliminate the sub-query when possible.
Query 3: The SQL query uses the EXISTS clause to check for the existence of rows in the `emp` table that match the condition `d.deptno = e.deptno`. Rule 1 suggests transformations for traditional filtering mechanisms like EXISTS, but it specifically provides transformations for IN, OR, and NOT IN clauses. The rule does not provide a direct transformation for EXISTS clauses. Therefore, while the rule matches the query's use of EXISTS, it does not offer a specific transformation for this case. As a result, no transformation is applied to the query based on the provided rule.

The provided query rewrite rules and sequences suggest a structured approach to optimize this query.\n\n1. **FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE**: This rule is applicable because the query contains an `EXISTS` sub-query within the WHERE clause that is correlated with the outer query. According to the rule, the `EXISTS` condition can be transformed into a JOIN operation. This transformation is prioritized as it directly addresses the sub-query structure and can significantly optimize the query by converting it into a more efficient JOIN operation.\n\n2. **PROJECT_REMOVE**: This rule is considered after applying the `FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE` rule. The original query does not have an outer query that merely selects the same columns as produced by the sub-query, so this rule might not directly apply in its typical form. However, if the transformation from the first rule results in a scenario where the outer query becomes redundant, this rule can be applied to remove unnecessary projections.\n\nGiven the rule subset sequences, we see that "FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE" is prioritized in both sequences 1 and 2, while "PROJECT_REMOVE" is in sequence 3.

FROM table1 WHERE column IN (SELECT column2 FROM table2 WHERE table1.join_column = table2.join_column)\n    - Transformed Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.join_column = table2.join_column WHERE table2.column2 IS NOT NULL\n  - For `EXISTS` Sub-queries: Convert the `EXISTS` condition into a JOIN operation, using WHERE to filter rows that match the JOIN condition.\n    - Original Query Structure: SELECT ... FROM table1 WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM table2 WHERE table1.join_column = table2.join_class)\n    - Transformed Query Structure: SELECT DISTINCT table1.* FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.join_column = table2.join_column\n  - For `UNIQUE` Sub-queries: Since `UNIQUE` requires a bit more complex handling not directly mappable to a standard JOIN, it should be considered a special case where the goal is to ensure that rows from the outer query match a unique set in the sub-query. This might not translate directly into SQL syntax without additional sub-query or DISTINCT aggregation."""\n\nArranged Rule Sequence: ["FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE", "PROJECT_REMOVE"]\n\nUtilized Rules: ["FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE", "PROJECT_REMOVE"]\n\nUnutilized Rules: []'}], 'response': 'Step 1: In the provided arrangement, all rules were utilized, and there are no unutilized rules. Therefore, there are no unutilized rules to prioritize over the utilized ones. However, we can still consider the effectiveness of the rule application based on the query rewrite suggestions.\n\nStep 2: Based on the query rewrite suggestions, the main focus is on simplifying the query by removing unnecessary operations and simplifying the logic. The `FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE` rule is relevant as it deals with transforming `EXISTS` sub-queries into JOIN operations, which aligns with the suggestion to simplify the query. The `PROJECT_REMOVE` rule is also relevant as it deals with removing unnecessary outer queries, which aligns with the suggestion to streamline the query. Since both rules are relevant and utilized, the original sequence is already optimal for the provided suggestions.\n\n```python\n["FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_CORRELATE", "PROJECT_REMOVE"]\n```', 'time': 2.687894344329834}
